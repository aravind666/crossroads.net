description: "If you&apos;ve been around here for more than five minutes or so, you might come to the conclusion that Crossroads is a pretty unusual place. But there&apos;s a method to our madness. That&apos;s why we&apos;re spending three weeks talking context for who we are, what we believe and why we do what we do. We hope to inform, inspire, answer some common questions and maybe even provoke some new ones. Stay tuned."
