description: "Youâ€™ll never find tires lying on the field during a football game. But running through
them during practice helps build the necessary footwork and agility for game situations. Spiritual strengthening is no different. Engaging God in
fresh ways can supercharge our growth, and reveal
spiritual muscles we never even knew we had."
