description: "God loves sex. Seriously. In fact, He wants you to have a great sex life. What does that mean? Over these five weeks we&apos;ll explore and expose the truths and lies about sex that circulate in our culture. There&apos;s healing and freedom waiting for us when we surrender our sex to God. It&apos;s sure to be eye-opening, a little uncomfortable and even fun."
