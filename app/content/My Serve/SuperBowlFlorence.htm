<p class="noPspace"><span style="color: #292929;">Thousands of kids participate in Kids&rsquo; Club every weekend. Help make room for even more kids by volunteering on Super Bowl Weekend. Serve by greeting new families, helping toddlers acclimate to a new environment, or leading a small group of kids in a fun activity that helps them discover who God is. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll pair you with an experienced Kids&rsquo; Club volunteer who will show you around. </span><a title="KC SB Mason" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KCFlorenceSB2014" target="_blank">Click here to sign up</a>.<span style="color: #000000;"><br /></span></p>

<h3>First Impressions</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Super Bowl weekend for First Impressions equals souped-up trucks and lots of popcorn. We&rsquo;d love for you to help us man the trucks and feed the masses, as well as get cars parked, greet folks at the doors, and help people to their seats.&nbsp;<a title="FI SB Florence" href="http://www.crossroads.net/my/signup/2003308"><strong>Click here to sign up</strong></a>&nbsp;(if you&rsquo;re not already signed in, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to do so, or to register).</p>
