<p class="header noPspace">Respite Night</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Friday, September 24, from 6-9pm</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We want to be a blessing to families of kids with special needs. So we&rsquo;re looking for folks to hang out with some kids with special needs and their siblings, so their parents can get some much-needed downtime. Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience. We&rsquo;ll be sure to find you a role that is within your comfort level. The event will take place in Kids&rsquo; Club at Crossroads Oakley and we&rsquo;ll be serving food that evening. We just ask that volunteers arrive by 5:15pm.</p>
