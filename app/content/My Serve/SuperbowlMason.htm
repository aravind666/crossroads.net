<h3>Kids&rsquo; Club&nbsp;</h3>
</div>
<p class="noPspace">Thousands of kids participate in Kids&rsquo; Club every weekend. Help make room for even more kids by volunteering on Super Bowl Weekend. Serve by greeting new families, helping toddlers acclimate to a new environment, or leading a small group of kids in a fun activity that helps them discover who God is. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll pair you with an experienced Kids&rsquo; Club volunteer who will show you around.&nbsp;<a title="KC SB Mason" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KCMasonSB2014" target="_blank">Click here to sign up</a>.</p>
