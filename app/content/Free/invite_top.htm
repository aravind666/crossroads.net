<p><em>I hope you&rsquo;ll join me for <strong>a six-week journey on what it means to experience true freedom</strong>&mdash;because as it turns out, we might not be as free as we think we are. Even worse, we may have been duped into believing that a &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; life is the key to happiness or that a relationship with God is about layering on rules and restrictions. <br /><br />But the Bible says that, &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; Not fear. Not guilt. Not morality. Not even religion. Freedom. <strong>Let&rsquo;s get ours.</strong> </em></p>
