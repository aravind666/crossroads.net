<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Don't miss the Free Prayer Experience.</span><br /><br />The Free Prayer Experience will take place March 21-29 at Crossroads Oakley. It's designed to be a simple, personal prayer journey with an audio guide to help you engage with God. It's great for those who have never prayed, or for those who pray everyday. It's designed to last about an hour, but you can take as much time as you'd like.</p>
