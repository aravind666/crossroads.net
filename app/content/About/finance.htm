	<h2>Finance</h2><span class="first">Many believe the Bible says &quot;money is the root of all evil.&quot;</span><br /><br />Not true. What it actually says is &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&hellip;&quot; (1 Timothy 6:10) Well, we don&rsquo;t &quot;love&quot; it, we just &quot;like it as a friend.&quot; Here&rsquo;s how finances work at Crossroads:<br /><ol><li>Generous people in our community love contributing to the things they see God doing around here. So they give, and <strong>we use that money to bless others</strong>.</li><li><strong>We base our budget on what we believe God wants</strong>, not on what we think we&rsquo;ll get.</li><li><strong>Money gets spent here, not stashed.</strong> People give to Crossroads so we can build into the community, not a mutual fund.</li><li>And volunteers? They keep us afloat.</li></ol>Our books are open, so ask us anything. Or, learn more about <a href="/my/give/index.php" title="Give">ways to give</a>.<br />
