It's designed to be a simple, personal prayer journey with an audio guide to help you engage with God. It's great for those who have never prayed, or for those who pray everyday. It's designed to last about an hour, but you can take as much time as you'd like.<br /><br /><h3>Prayer Experience Hours</h3><strong>Sunday, March 22:</strong> 1:30-8pm<br /><strong>Monday, March 23:</strong> 7:30am-8:30pm<br /><strong>Tuesday, March 24:</strong> 7:30am-8:30pm<br /><strong>Wednesday, March 25:</strong> 7:30am-8:30pm <em>(Childcare available from 5:30-9pm)</em><br /><strong>Thursday, March 26:</strong> 7:30am-8:30pm <em>(Childcare available from 5:30-9pm)</em><br /><strong>Friday, March 27:</strong> 6:30am-8:30pm<br /><strong>Saturday, March 28:</strong> 7:30am-1:30pm <em>(Childcare available from 9am-1pm)</em><br /><strong>Sunday, March 29:</strong> 1:30-8pm<br /><strong>Monday, March 30:</strong> 1:30-8:30pm<br /><br /><strong>Please note:</strong> if you do NOT have kids needing childcare, please try to attend the Prayer Experience when childcare is not offered.
