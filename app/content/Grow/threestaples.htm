<h3>Attend the Weekend Experience</h3>
Gather with others to explore questions about God and the Bible, and be challenged to apply what you learn to your life. The weekend is also how we get on the same page as a community, and one way we&rsquo;re mobilized to be a blessing to our city and our world. Here are <a title="Service Times &amp; Directions" href="/my/about/serviceTimes.php">service times and directions</a>.</li>

<h3>Engage with God Daily</h3>
Reading the Bible and praying on a regular basis teach us how to hear and respond to God&rsquo;s voice. We help facilitate that with The Daily, a tool that enables you to engage with the Bible and prayer in just 15 minutes a day, following a simple format of reading, reflection and response. You can <a title="Subscribe to The Daily" href="/my/grow/theDailySignup.php">subscribe to receive The Daily</a> via e-mail, or <a title="The Daily" href="/my/daily.php">read it online here</a>.<br /><em>Looking to unsubscribe from The Daily emails? <a title="Unsubscribe from The Daily" href="/my/grow/theDailyUnsubscribe.php">Click here</a>.</em></li>

Smaller community is where we can be fully known, celebrated and challenged toward living like Jesus. Around here, that can begin in Small Groups, Community Groups, Healing Groups&mdash;anywhere you&rsquo;re finding close relationships, support and accountability.</li>

<h3>Live Generously</h3>
Be a part of something bigger than yourself by connecting with someone in need, joining a serving team or beginning (or increasing) financial giving. Being generous with time and money blesses others, and they&rsquo;re important ways God forms our character and grows us. <a title="Engage" href="/engage">Click here to discover some ways you can be generous with your time</a>. <a title="Give Overview" href="/my/give/">Click here to help fuel life change here and around the world by giving financially.</a><br /><br />In addition to the essentials of growth, there are also many <a title="Growth Catalysts" href="/my/grow/growthcatalysts.htm">growth catalysts</a> that can mark milestones on your journey to help turbo-charge your spiritual growth. </li>
