Here are some places to start.</span><br /><br />It takes thousands of volunteers to make Crossroads happen every weekend. And as our community grows, we&rsquo;ll need even more folks to do everything from hanging out with kids to making coffee. So, pick a team and join the ranks of everyday revolutionaries that make this place run. Just give it a try, two weeks a month for six months. You can meet new friends, grow spiritually and maybe learn the secret handshake.<br /><br /></p>
