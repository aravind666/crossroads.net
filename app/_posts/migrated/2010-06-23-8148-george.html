<p><strong>Wednesday, June 23 </strong><br> George</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to reveal his adventure to you and to fill you with boldness.</em></p>

<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>While the Bible is the place to start for examples of adventure, its certainly not the only place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>George Mueller lived during the 1800s and his life reflects an adventure only God could design. Mueller never asked once for money from anyone but God, yet he cared for over 10,000 orphans in England. He housed, fed, and educated every one of them--at tremendous expense. George Muellers passion for the orphan ministry, though, wasnt primarily the orphans themselves. He wanted others to see the reality of trusting God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a study of Muellers life, John Piper says, This was his supreme passion: to display with open proofs that God could be trusted with the practical affairs of life. This was the higher aim of building the orphan houses and supporting them by asking God, not people, for money. So when faced with a crisis of not knowing how to pay a bill, Mueller didnt know how the money would come. He just believed God would provide, no question about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That sounds like a life of adventure.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Starting an orphanage when caring for orphans isnt your primary motivator seems counterintuitive, yet thats what Mueller did to glorify God. Is God calling you to an adventure that seems beyond yourself, and so you find yourself wondering where to begin, given your limited time, money and experience? Could it be that Hes interested in the glory for the work hes called you to, and the answer of how is simply him? Ask God if the adventure he has for you brings glory solely to him. If so, ask Him for the means to make it happen, and give him the glory when it does.</p>
