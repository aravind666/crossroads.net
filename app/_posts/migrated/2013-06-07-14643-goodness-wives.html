<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodness: Wives</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out this week and this series on Good Sex by looking at a passage for wives today and husbands tomorrow. Dont check out if you are single. See what God wants to say to you today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:21-24&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5:21-24</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In Ephesians Paul speaks to wives and then husbands, but first, there is an overall statement for both. The Message translation that we look at today says courteously reverent, while other translations say submit. When we submit to each other, we put others needs first. When we do that as a church, we invite more of Jesus. There are good words here for wives, but also remember that the church as a whole is Gods bride. This section is for all, and we model Christ and the church well when there is mutual submission in a marriage.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a moment--whether you are male or female--to write about how it could look to receive Christ like a husband.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 2</a>.</p>
