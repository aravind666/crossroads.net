<html><body><p>As many of you know, Crossroads is launching its first multisite
location on <strong>October 5th in Mason</strong>. We've been getting a lot of question
about multisite, from "what is it?" and "how will it work?" to
"gee...are you selling franchise rights?" (Uh..no.) <br><br>So...to
answer any outstanding questions and to clarify our multisite strategy,
we caught up with Molly Cunningham, Crossroads' director of multisite,
for a brief (twelve-minute) interview:<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/mp3/Multisite1.mp3"><br></a><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/mp3/Multisite1.mp3"><strong>Download and Listen</strong></a> (12 MB mp3)</p></body></html>
