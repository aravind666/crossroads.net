<p>Big Numbers</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you read whats below, spend a few minutes asking God to speak to you during this time.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:47&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:47</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Good news brings big numbers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Shack is a fiction book that wrestles with the question of finding God through tragedy and pain. After self-publishing the book for his children, author William Young was encouraged to publish the book to a wider audience--but he was rejected by numerous religious and secular publishers alike.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After forming his own media company with some friends and publishing the book on his own in 2007, the book still went unnoticed. Then suddenly in the summer of 2008, The Shack, a book that no one wanted to publish, was #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list. In just three years, it has sold more than 10 million copies and is printed in 34 languages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why the sudden surge in popularity? The books message resonated with readers who couldnt wait to tell their friends about it. And their friends told their friends. Suddenly, a book with a $300 marketing budget became the best-selling book in the country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When somethings worth mentioning, the news spreads like wildfire. Thats how Jesus message was, and continues to be. It speaks for itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Good News may bring big numbers, but what matters is that the numbers represent individual lives changed. What Good News do you have that could bring someone to a place of healing, wonder, etc.?</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past two weeks weve taken a look at some of the early churchs characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are one or two things about the early church that have stuck out at you? Why?</li>
<li>What are one or two ways you can be like the early church, both as an individual and with others?</li>
</ul>
