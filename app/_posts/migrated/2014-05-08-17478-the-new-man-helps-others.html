<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Helps Others</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man makes tough choices and takes a minority position. This week, The Daily will focus on what God says to men about living and working in the minority.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you stand up for someone in need.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A25-37&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:25-37</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Every morning we jump in our car or hop on a bike and go to work. We listen to the radio and swerve through traffic unaware of the people around us. But the story of the Good Samaritan reminds us that everyone needs someone to stand up for them. A boy will rush by a car wreck, walk past the stranger on the street and ignore his sisters feelings. But a man stands up and helps his neighbor.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Help someone out today. Whether you give your car away, purchase someones meal or say a simple prayer, how can you stand up and share Gods love with them? Think about it, then go do it.</p>
