<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Appetites: Bread Alone</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were looking at how our desire to be loved---if misdirected---can create unhealthy appetites in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%204:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 4:1-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus taught us that theres more to life than bread alone. Fasting is a time-honored way to pull something out of our lives that may be standing between us and God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Richard Foster writes, fasting reveals the things that control us. Think of something that may be standing in the way of you feeling like a treasured child of God---it could be anything from food to exercising to television to Facebook. Try cutting it out of your life for at least one day this week, and ask God to meet you during that time.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, please give me the discipline to make more room for you in my life. Thank you for meeting me where I am.</p>
