<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the last few weeks, The Daily has taken a deeper look at the book of Acts. This week, well finish our study of how its lessons apply to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to pull you through.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+27%3A21-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 27:21-26</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul is on his way by boat to Italy. After a big storm, their journey didnt get any easier and their food supply, morale and hope was at a record low. But God made it clear to Paul that they would make it, they just might get sidetracked along the way. When we get sidetracked or feel like the path were on will never end, God wants to reassure us that he will pull us through the storm if we put our faith in him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about a tough situation youre experiencing---it could be big or small. What can you do to trust that God will pull you through? It could be reading the Bible or changing a habit. Think about it, then go do it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
