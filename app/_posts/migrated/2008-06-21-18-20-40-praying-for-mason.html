This weekend Brian Tome shared more about the launch of Crossroads Mason in
October. A few hundred people from our community have been working on
this for over a year, and we're getting close to launch! (You can read more about our multi-site plans <a href=\"../../about/campuses.php\">here</a>.)<br /><br />We need people willing to pray to support and encourage the launch of
Crossroads Mason, so please consider signing up to be a prayer partner for the
Mason Launch Team. Once you sign up, we'll give you the name of someone
on the Mason Launch Team to pray for. If you're interested in serving
as a prayer partner, please <a href=\"../mysend/143\" title=\"Email Mason Prayer\">email us</a>. <br /><br /><strong>Also</strong>, if you'd like to hear Brian's talk about this from the &quot;I AM&quot; series, you can <a href=\"../players/media/hq/I_AM_4_Reproduced_04-27-08_Tome_webaudio.mp3\">download it here</a>.
