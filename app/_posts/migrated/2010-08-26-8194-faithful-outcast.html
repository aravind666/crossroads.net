<p>Faithful Outcast<br><em><br>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness to you.</em></p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2011:31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:31</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Does something seem out of place about this notion? Theres a whole list of people that are praised for their faithfulness, and right in the middle of the list is a prostitute, Rahab.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regardless of our background, its unlikely that a prostitute is our first thought if were making a list of people faithful to God. Yet the writer of Hebrews says the exact oppositeit doesnt matter what you look like or where youve been. All that matters are your choices to follow God now.</p>
<ul>
<li>What was so spectacular about Rahabs faithfulness that it would make this list? (See the below story in Joshua for more context.)</li>
<li>Do you ever feel like your past keeps you from being faithful? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We tend to be rather harsh critics of those who dont measure up to our standardall the while sweeping our own unfaithfulness under the rug. Ask God to help you show kindness to those who dont fit the mold. You could even ask that person how you can be a blessing to them today.</p>
