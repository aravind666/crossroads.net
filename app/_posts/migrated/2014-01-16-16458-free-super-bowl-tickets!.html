<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">BRING YOUR BUDDIES</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Super Bowl of Preaching is one of the easiest ways to introduce your friends to God. Its just like Awaited---except that we switch out all the artistry and beauty with absurdity and dumb jokes. If you have a friend willing to check out a church service with tailgating and a halftime show, this is the weekend to bring him. You could start by forwarding the link to <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001SeFPmlwYMw2xGEh3TJi6-7pUpwLrwoQ85uPX3pctcGSLrIM9r9BKJrhszrcgN6qAt4CuK1UKgFrwG9l0HcduobN7bi_9T8xBsCsQjVE9nBTVKt7Ar8Rlz34BelKE19cO" target="_blank">this years Super Bowl teaser video</a>.</p>
