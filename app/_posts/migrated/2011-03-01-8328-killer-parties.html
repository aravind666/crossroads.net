<p>Killer Parties</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please reveal how youre offering me your best and nothing short of it.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway John 2:1-12" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN%202:1-12&amp;version=NIV">John 2:1-12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So this is Jesus first miracle. Wine out of water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it seems like He aimed kind of low, doesnt it? There are dying people to heal, demons to kill off, limbs to mend, but He starts with making wine at the end of a party. Why? The banquet-masters surprised comment to the groom captures it perfectly: You saved the best until now. In other words, Jesus didnt end the party with Two Buck Chuck like any normal person would have done. It was completely unexpected and over-the-top. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the midst of suffering and hardship, in the face of a whole nation who didnt understand or accept him, Jesus offers his best in this moment. Not just enough. Not lets skip it for something more important. His best.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Why could it be hard to see God this way--as an abundant giver, even in seemingly minor situations?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Get a sheet of paper and take a couple of minutes to write down some times in the past where God has given you something that felt abundant or just really good. This could be relationships, provisions or experiences. Then thank God for the ways he has given you more than just enough.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 16" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016&amp;version=NIV">Acts 16</a></p>
