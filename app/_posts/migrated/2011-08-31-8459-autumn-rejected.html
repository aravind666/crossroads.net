<p>Autumn: Rejected?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, remind me of you, and what you have done for me, especially when life seems hard.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107390418520&amp;s=0&amp;e=001XLljPSuScRIUKShgazG3BZaR6WPUCgUIB86IdonJiCVtRxGvV_tjd8K7C7_sNzXzlVC72MCOVjdMDcp0br1HrFom-sAoF1v-_f54yWQmgKNvVZxpYTZgUSUX0hC4nw7cbdYxMmZ2_CLD-vGSNlaXhprPJxJyqGA8rYqP6cJkKmzDESB2HUC1nhSYn0whasKJZJWVLd5Kb86s5sS72Z5Qq19mPCuCg3rf" target="_blank">Psalm 77:1-12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>David writes in such irony here when he says, "Has his unfailing love vanished forever?"</p>
<p>He  questions God even as he calls on his love unfailing. We can know with  our heads that God keeps his promises and that his love is unfailing,  but that knowledge doesnt always change the way we feel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There  is a battle inside of David and he realizes what he needs to do is  remember with all of his being. He will consider Gods works, and  meditate on His mighty deeds, remembering Gods miracles of long ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  spring, its easy to be thankful for what God is doing. In the fall,  being thankful for what God has done is a discipline, as we may not see  him at work in the moment. Like David, we can choose to remember with  purpose, and the victory is ours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take  a moment and write about something God has done for you. Remember a  time when He saw you through, blessed you, or worked a miracle in your  life. Also, watch for opportunities today to tell someone about it.</p>
