<p class="noPspace"><strong>James: Mature and Complete</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Last week, we read the entire book of James. This week, were focusing on one passage and going phrase by phrase.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may bemature and complete, not lacking anything.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001xX0fcSJtAfsch9kH9VGYl6FKjuN_3PvYZH9hKEJ3GVOkV_ak9tc_1SSTmYsfmgUr1FOtssNYdhYHXM9dxChoL0uGynE0khccyR6yxv3NZYjNkdObhoTHiT3m5ab9Gi1vocL29d9b_Tm_ZYDVz2HQ0BmedxPHGgHXBm4UySSGMsOvwRUZhI0cw9X_2eGzyKW_" target="_blank">James 1:2-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>When you see one of those "26.2" stickers on your friends car, its usually not a statement that she enjoyed running that marathon--its a celebration that she finished it. Just like we find satisfaction in physical completion, James reminds us that perseverance in our trials brings spiritual completion. And the more complete we become, the more we allow God to shape us into who he perfectly designed us to be.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>God, I want to be mature and complete. Please fill me with the perseverance and strength to get there.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
