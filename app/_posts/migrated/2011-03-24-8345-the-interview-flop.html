<p>The Interview Flop</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me see where Im holding back because I dont trust what you say about me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%204:10-14&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 4:10-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>While Moses is getting this amazing job offer from God, he quickly starts backpedaling and listing his faults: no good at public speaking, slow to the draw, not the right guy for the job. But Moses is saying this to the God who created him from scratchto the God who knows precisely what Moses value is and what hes capable of doing. Moses just cant accept it. He sees himself as a misfit; he questions Gods choice. (But check out the grace in this: God tells Moses to take his brother along as a sidekick, and that hell help them both.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>What makes us hem and haw when we feel God prompting us to something? Do we wonder if He really knows us? Do we press pause on our trust in Him? Or do we say, No really, God, Im not cut out for that, because were simply unwilling to move?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When have you ever said or felt, Im not the right one for this role? Decide what spurred that response. (Potential spurs: fear, pride, lack of trust, unwillingness to move, healthy boundaries, prayerful discernment.) Whether good or bad, what does your response say about your trust in God?</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>

<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%205&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 5</a></p>
