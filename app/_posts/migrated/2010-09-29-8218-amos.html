<p>Amos</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Jesus, teach me today how to live out your will in every area of my life, and teach me about your heart for justice.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Amos%202:6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Amos 2:6-8</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>In an emphatic manner, Amos lists the sins of the nations surrounding Israel. You can probably imagine the Israelites hearing Amos read the list out loud and rallying that indeed these other nations are bad and sinful. But then he follows the list with Israels sins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Israelites have four core sins. They sell people for new shoes. They deny justice to oppressed people. Fathers and sons take prostitutes. They drink wine and wear clothes that come from unjust places.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the time, the rich people of Israel assumed that if they paid their tithes and were generally well-behaved, then the way they treated the poor didnt matter. But God had Amos write a whole book to convey that what mattered to him most was how his people treated the poorest and the most oppressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God if there are any areas in your life where he would want you to focus less on what you want and more on what others need.</p>
