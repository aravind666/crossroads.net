<div>Deny It</div>
<div><em><br>Spend a few minutes with God telling him about the day ahead of you. Ask Him to surround you, guide you and reveal his power. </em></div>
<div><strong><br>READ</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:23-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 9:23-24</a></div>
<div><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></div>
<div>The  quarterback surrenders to the coachs offensive system. The boxer is  nothing without the people in his corner. If were serious about  fitness, we submit to a trainer. Spiritual training is the same way. We  surrender to be strong. </div>
<div>
<br>If  you did the <a href="http://strongchallenge.com/">Strong Challenge</a>, you just spent six weeks surrendering to  God. You put your own agenda aside for part of the day and spent time  responding, studying, playing, serving and talking with God. This is  what Jesus refers to in Luke 9:23 when he says deny yourself and follow  him. Because in the moments we choose to be with God--when we check in  with our coach--our selfishness falls by the wayside. Were reminded of  our role and we stay present in the game.</div>
<div>
<br>The more we check in, the more instinctive it becomes. Each time, we grow stronger.</div>
<div><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></div>
<div>Think  about your Strong Challenges. What did you deny yourself as you did  them? Maybe it was skipping a meal or interrupting your schedule. Maybe  you denied yourself by refusing to worry, ambushing someone with love or  by replacing drudgery with play. Youve had great practice  surrendering. Today, try it again.</div>
<div><strong><br><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></div>
<div>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Titus 1</a>
