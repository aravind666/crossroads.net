<html><body><p class="noPspace">Have questions about God, faith, evangelism or any of the topics we’ve been covering? Start off the week on a bold and authentic note, and send them to <a href="mailto:questions@crossroads.net" target="_blank">questions@crossroads.net</a>. Ask questions about anything, on either side of the belief equation. We’ll address the questions that we receive the weekend of June 16-17.</p></body></html>
