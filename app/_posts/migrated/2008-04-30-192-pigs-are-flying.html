<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/2008PigLogo.jpg" alt="Flying Pig" hspace="5" width="135" height="139" align="right">This weekend every year we experience something akin to <strong>traffic armageddon</strong> in Cincinnati. It's the weekend in which police go around randomly closing streets and forcing cars like mice into mazes. For most, it's a losing game. But for the prepared, it's simply not a problem.<br><br>Before leaving the house this Sunday, make sure you've checked the <a href="http://www.flyingpigmarathon.com/race_information/course/">Flying Pig Marathon Route</a> to see which of your local streets will be closed. Trust me... you definitely do <em>not </em>want to miss the service this weekend...</body></html>
