<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Unless youre a detailed note-taker, sometimes its hard to remember the weekend message come Monday morning. The world is full of wolves seeking to destroy what God is saying to us. But Paul encourages us to be alert for the things that can distract our attention from God. It will happen, but if we are more aware of it, we will be more successful at holding on to what is true.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What is something that without fail distracts you? It could be a social situation, break time at work or something as simple as the TV at home. Be aware of what distracts you and if it happens, try stepping back.</p>
