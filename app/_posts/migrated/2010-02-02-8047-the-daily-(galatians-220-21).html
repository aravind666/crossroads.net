<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>When we begin following Jesus, he invades our heart and starts to change us from the inside out. But He isnt only interested in giving us a new-and-improved life. He wants to heal anything in us thats broken, root out anything in our life that is against God, and give us the power and love to be about the things that he is about: love, redemption and freedom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul says, I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. What do you think this means?</li>
<li>Have you experienced any growth or change that you can only attribute to Jesus presence in your life?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong><br>Jesus work in us is a continual process. Thank Him for any growth and change hes already led you through. Then, ask Him if there are any areas in your life that he wants to inhabit more deeply or fully.</p>
