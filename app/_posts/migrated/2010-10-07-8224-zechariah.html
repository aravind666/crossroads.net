<p><strong>Thursday, October 7 </strong><br>Zechariah</p>
<p><br><em>Prayer: Jesus, show me where in my life I can reveal your heart for mercy and compassion.</em></p>
<p><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Zechariah%207:5-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Zechariah 7:5-10</a></p>
<p><br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>In Zechariah, God draws a clear line in the sand.</p>
<p><br>Fasting is an intense discipline and can bring us closer in relationship with Jesus. But if were just doing it to look good or because its become tradition, then its fruitless. It doesnt bring glory to God.</p>
<p><br>Here in Zechariah, God questions the motives of the fasting Israelites. And He again commands his followers to have compassion on the community outsidersthe people who have lost their spouses, the children without parents, the foreigners, the people in poverty.</p>
<p><br>Justice. Mercy. Compassion. These things bring glory to God.</p>
<p><strong><br><br>RESPOND </strong><br>Widows and orphans might conjure up images from Oliver Twist, but chances are there is someone close to you who feels alone and outside of the community. Look for them today and find a way to include them.</p>
