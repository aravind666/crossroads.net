the only ones chasing history. As of this weekend, Crossroads will
strive to maintain the record for most consecutive Super Bowl services
in the nation(6). <br><br>Above is a picture from last year's pre-game
show. Yeah, that's right, there's a pre-game show. You need to get here
EARLY so that you can experience the whole football atmosphere. There's
a post in the forum right now about <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?f=3" title="Tailgating in the Forum">Super Bowl tailgating</a>, and there will be free hotdogs, popcorn and more before every game. <br><br>I
can't reveal anything that happens during the service or the half-time
show, but trust me when I say I reorganized an entire weekend out of
town when I realized it conflicted with the Super Bowl of Preaching. <br><br>So
bring your cornhole set and your friends for one or all of the services
this weekend. Saturday at 5 and 7pm, and Sunday at 9 and 11am or 1pm. </body></html>
