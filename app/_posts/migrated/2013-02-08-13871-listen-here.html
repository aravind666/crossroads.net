<p class="noPspace"><strong>Listen: Here</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today, we finish out the week in looking at active listening.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%203:2-9&amp;version=TNIV">1 Samuel 3:2-9</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Samuel is a boy in the care of temple priest Eli. Eli gives him excellent training in how to listen. Step one: recognize that its Gods voice. Step two: tell God you are listening. Step three: listen. Samuel does what Eli teaches him to do, and God speaks. We have looked this week at going to the mouth of the cave, opening the door, and Samuel speaking out loud that he is listening. No matter how you slice it, listening, not just hearing, has active steps.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">RESPOND</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Be Samuel today. Say out loud, Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Tell of one time that you either heard God (although maybe not audibly) or think he might have been trying to get your attention.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Share what your gut feeling is about what Jesus would do or be like if he came to your house or where you stay.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Brainstorm some spaces or places that you could make room to listen.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20peter%201&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">2 Peter 1</a></p>
