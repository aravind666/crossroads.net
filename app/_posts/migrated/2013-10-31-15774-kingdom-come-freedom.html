<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOhn%2015:%2010-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">John 15:10-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve looked a little closer at what it means to obey our Dad. Thinking back on this weeks stories, we know that each time someone obeyed, the good on the other side was sweeter than any slice of pie. Thats called freedom. Were free when we abide-when we receive from our Dad, trust him and follow his commands. Its not the easiest route, but the fruit of abiding is joy and freedom unlike what weve known. Just check out <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:22-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">Galatians 5:22-23</a> for more of that fruit.</p>

Write down a lyric that stands out to you. What does that lyric say about how you can receive, trust or obey your Dad?</p>
