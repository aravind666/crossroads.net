<p>Samuel Hears From God</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to encourage you as you read Samuels story.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%203:1-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 3:1-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Samuel was listening, but he couldnt recognize that it was God speaking to him because he hadnt yet come to recognize Gods voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are there ways in your life that God might be speaking to you, but you are attributing it to something else? Could God be trying to speak to you through your circumstances, your friends or scripture in some way? Maybe you need to say, like Samuel, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</p>
