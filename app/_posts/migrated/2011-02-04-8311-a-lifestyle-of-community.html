<p>A Lifestyle of Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway colossians 2:6-7" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians%202:6-7&amp;version=NIV">Colossians 2:6-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This life of following Christ: its not a sprint towards a finish line. Its a long, often arduous journey, marked by twists and turns, periods of joy and periods of doubt. Its not for the faint of heart, and its not to be done alone. You will be full of faith and you will seek answers (perhaps simultaneously), but God has given us two precious gifts. The first is the gift of his Holy Spirit, who resides in us and works through to accomplish every work in our lives. And the second is the community of Christ-followers around us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you consider the past few weeks of the Daily, consider how God may be leading you towards him by engaging in intentional, active, and authentic community (friendship) with other people who are have oriented their lives towards looking and behaving like Jesus. And continue to live your life in Him, rooted and built up, strengthened in the faith you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. That is community.</p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Reflect back over the last few weeks of the Daily. If youve got a group of Christ-followers you spend time with, get together and go through the following questions.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>How can we practice the discipline of community with intentionality in 2011?</li>
<li>I personally see ________ in our community, and it __________ me. (Offer additional explanation if youre able.)</li>
<li>I look forward to more _______ with all of you, so over the next few months Id like to ___________. (Offer additional explanation if youre able.)</li>
</ul>
