<p><strong>Monday, January 18</strong><br>Harder than it Looks<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Psalm 10<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Unfortunately, life is not fair, and living wisely does not automatically protect us from hard times. There are days when God seems completely absent, while those who ignore him enjoy most of lifes blessing. Its enough to make us want to get angry with God (its OK, he knows how we feel), which is exactly what the writer of this passage does. <br><br>But even this frustration does not keep him from wisely continuing to trust God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever felt like the writer of this Psalm? How did you deal with it?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What helps you trust God during hard times?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>When we experience frustration like this, a little bit of encouragement can go a long way. Turn to a fresh page in your journal and write a list of ways that God has blessed and cared for you in the past, then spend a few minutes thanking him. Then fold down the corner of this page so that you can come back and read it the next time God seems absent and you are struggling. (If that time is now, take a few extra minutes with your list to remind yourself of what God has done.)<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK<br></strong>Ecclesiastes 3:14-17</p>
