The study is presented in a paraphrase of the Bible called The Message, which gives us biblical text in simple, modern language.<br><br><strong>READ</strong><br><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LrD8sy0j9k1P2HXxxkeqDhS1x_aWbU4ghlceIKY0il6lQNY7wc2FM8Bo5nj0npu2oaeqUEuVnOqe4uxF-LE78nDaN6tdIgxTrXOLx2TEt7KJoZSKFbhobPP1VH70sAVuWC8ugNr6bB7e48xUUEHmb8TJHhKO_1fu8UQTU4Kr76g9gFu0scDTa_GH_LPIXaoPWqW50-jmF5wLC2rZH8BklaWx0qTaqD1xQf8bKibA522H1lYJskqwRUjIIwbbdLBi" target="_blank">Acts 27:13-15, 27:21-26, 27:39-28:10</a><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Paul encountered and was dramatically converted by the resurrected Christ. He went on to spend the rest of his life sharing the Gospel and building and encouraging churches all over the ancient world. So its probably pretty safe to say that Paul spent a great deal of his time exactly where God wanted him, following the direction of the Holy Spirit and fulfilling Gods will for his life.<br><br>And yet, Paul was no stranger to hardship and distress.<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LrD8sy0j9k1P2HXxxkeqDhS1x_aWbU4ghlceIKY0il6lQNY7wc2FM8Bo5nj0npu2oaeqUEuVnOqe4uxF-LE78nDaN6tdIgxTrXOLx2TEt7KJoZSKFbhobPP1VH70sAVuxlN-F_gTbooblBJId_p8oX_7Tmd7wiOo2We-VR9cx8nT_bXSFbC8fJhIvWWQL9Ix-VPn8dfSSDOvBdkfia-F5bnIZZDSSpo7" target="_blank">He even boasted of his many sufferings</a>, knowing that the hardships he endured would draw him closer to God and make him more like Jesus.
