<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Thursday, November 26</strong><br>Thankful<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 3:14-21<br>(Yes, this includes the section that you probably read yesterday. Read it again.)<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Look back at the passage, and mark (underline, highlight, circlewhatever) all the words that describe something that Paul is asking God to do or give.<br><br>Sounds like God is pretty busy.<br><br>He lives in us.<br><br>He gives us resources.<br><br>He gives us love. Power. Strength. Understanding.<br><br>The list could be much longer, but you get the idea. He is deeply connected, deeply invested in every facet of our lives. Its fitting that this comes today, a day that we set aside to celebrate being thankful for the blessings we have (Thanksgiving is more than a day to gorge on turkey and fall asleep watching the Detroit Lions lose again).<br></p>
<ul><li>Paul says that God is able to accomplish infinitely more than we ask or think. How have you experienced this or been surprised by God in the past? How would you like to experience this in your life?</li></ul>
<ul><li>In the midst of the needs of more than 6 billion people on the planet, God wants this kind of intimate, deep, empowering relationship with you. How does that make you feel?</li></ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Take a few minutes to list some of the things that you are thankful for (you could even do this with your family and friends around the dinner table), and then spend a few minutes actually thanking God for each one, specifically.<br></body></html>
