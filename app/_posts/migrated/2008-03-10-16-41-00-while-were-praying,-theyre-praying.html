<html><body><p>My husband is in Mamelodi with <a href="http://www.beadedhope.com">Beaded Hope.</a> I talked to him this morning, and he told me he attended two Charity and Faith services yesterday. I just wanted to let you know that their community is still fervently praying for us to be freed from the bonds of materialism. They spent a good deal of each service praying over our pictures.<br><br>So, as you go through the Prayer Experience this week, know that your friends in Mamelodi are praying for you even as you pray.<br><br></p></body></html>
