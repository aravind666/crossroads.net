<p class="NormalWeb1">Kindness</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em><br>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%202:3-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 2:3-4</a><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Last week, we examined patience. Patience suggests a more passive approach to love in the face of provocation. Often patient love will go unnoticed. But kindness is an active expression of love toward God and others.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Kindness and judgment dont mix. If youre looking down on someone (even if theyre in the wrong), you arent receiving or reflecting Gods Spirit of kindness. Kindness means acting with grace and mercy toward imperfect people. It often stands out as an unexpected response, because it isnt what the recipient deserved.</p>
<ul>
<li>When have you seen Gods Spirit of kindness working through another person? </li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Do you know someone in your life who needs kindness, whether or not theyre asking for it? What would an act of kindness to that person look like today? The Holy Spirit will help if you ask.</p>
