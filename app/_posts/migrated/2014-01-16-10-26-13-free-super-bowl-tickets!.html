<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We’re excited to announce that tickets for the 2014 Super Bowl of Preaching services will be available this Friday. (Oh, you thought we were talking about a different Super Bowl? Sorry about that.) </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">GET YOUR TICKETS THIS FRIDAY</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Free tickets for Florence, Mason and Oakley will be available starting at 10am on Friday, January 17. Go to <a href="/" target="_blank">crossroads.net/superbowl</a> for service times and ticket reservations.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">BRING YOUR BUDDIES</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Super Bowl of Preaching is one of the easiest ways to introduce your friends to God. It’s just like Awaited---except that we switch out all the artistry and beauty with absurdity and dumb jokes. If you have a friend willing to check out a church service with tailgating and a halftime show, this is the weekend to bring him. You could start by forwarding the link to <a href="/" target="_blank">this year’s Super Bowl teaser video</a>.</p>
