<p>Micah</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Lord, teach me how to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Micah%201:7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Micah 1:7</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Micah%206:8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Micah 6:8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The times of prostitution did not end in the Old Testament. Girls are in India right now who have been stolen from or sold by their families and placed into brothels and temple prostitution. And its not just happening in India.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As it disgusted God during the time of Micah, social corruption disgusts him today. And God still desires that we bring about the end to large injustices in the world. He has made us his hands and feet to unite together and show the world his amazing justice and mercy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Micah, we see the prophesy of both a nation suffering for its corrupt ways and then a nation completely restored by Gods justice and mercy. God desired this intense restoration in the time of Micahand he desires it now. In our nations. In us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a minute right now and ask God to bring about big change in the world around those who are oppressed and mistreated. Ask God what he would have you do to make a difference.</p>
