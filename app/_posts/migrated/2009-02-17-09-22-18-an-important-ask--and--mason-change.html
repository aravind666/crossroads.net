<em>A message from Brian:</em><br><br>While much of our nation is experiencing tension that comes from scarcity, Crossroads is experiencing tension that comes from abundance. This January's attendance was 40% higher than last January's attendance. The fact is that we're having a hard time finding seats for our friends while we head into our most important season of the year, this year's all-church journey, Reset.<br><br>Therefore, we're making a very important ask for the six weeks of the Reset journey, and also permanently changing our service times in Mason.<br><br><strong><u>THE ASK</u>: If you consider yourself "on the team" at Crossroads and you normally attend Crossroads Oakley, please attend the 8:30 Sunday morning service for the next six weeks.</strong><br><br>In case you haven't noticed, we've been completely maxed out at the 10am service at Oakley, and Saturday night and 11:45 on Sunday are very close behind. We know that we're having to turn away hundreds of new people who feel like there just isn't room for them at these services. We're looking at what we can do to better accommodate crowds on the weekend, but for the next six weeks of the journey, we need your help to free up seats during these most popular service times. We want to do our best to make sure no one is turned away during this peak season, especially while we're taking a close look at Jesus, the most important thing we can do and the very reason why Crossroads exists.<br><br><strong><u>THE CHANGE</u>: Beginning this weekend, service times in Mason will change permanently to 9:30 and 11am.</strong> (Oakley service times will stay the same.)<br><br>These new, slightly later start times should help us even out the attendance between the two Sunday services in Mason, and enable us to welcome more friends during the Reset journey. <strong>If you live anywhere near I-275 in the northern Cincinnati area, please attend Mason for the next six weeks.</strong> (For those of you who haven't been there yet, it's awesome. You'll love it.)<br><br>Thanks for making adjustments to your life in order to experience the Reset journey, and for making room for others to do the same. The next six weeks might very well be the best and most important weeks we've experienced at Crossroads yet. We're getting ready, and getting excited. I hope you're doing the same.<br><br>Brian<br>Â </body></html>
