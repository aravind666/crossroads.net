<html><body><p class="noPspace">A community-wide Journey, this year called Kingdom Come, focuses the entire church on one topic for six weeks. Everyone—from kids to the old folks—is on the same page, learning about the same topics and growing in similar ways. A Journey consists of three parts: the weekend message, small group interaction and individual experiments. For the six weeks of the journey—beginning October 12—it is the main thing. Everything else shuts down. Everyone participates. Everyone is challenged.</p></body></html>
