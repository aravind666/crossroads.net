<p class="noPspace">A community-wide Journey, this year called Kingdom Come, focuses the entire church on one topic for six weeks. Everyone&mdash;from kids to the old folks&mdash;is on the same page, learning about the same topics and growing in similar ways. A Journey consists of three parts: the weekend message, small group interaction and individual experiments. For the six weeks of the journey&mdash;beginning October 12&mdash;it is the main thing. Everything else shuts down. Everyone participates. Everyone is challenged.</p>
