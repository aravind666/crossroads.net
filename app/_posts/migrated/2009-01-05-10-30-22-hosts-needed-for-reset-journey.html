For six weeks, we'll all be on the same page, exploring the life and teachings of Jesus, and discovering where we need to reset our assumptions of him. A critical part of the journey is the small group experience, and <strong>we're expecting to need 1,500 small group hosts this year. That means we need YOU.</strong><br><br>Hosting is easy and doesn't require any Bible expertise. All you need is a place to host a small group, a welcoming attitude, and access to a DVD player. We'll set you up with what you need, and even provide (optional) training for anyone who wants it.<br><br>To learn more about Reset, hear a short message from Brian Tome about the journey, and sign up to host a group, check out <a href="/reset" title="Reset">crossroads.net/reset</a>.</body></html>
