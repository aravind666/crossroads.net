<p>Cheerful Givers</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to unify the Crossroads community during the Game Change Campaign.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%208:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 8:1-4</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%209:6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The Macedonian church was extremely poor and extremely generous. In fact, they pleaded for the chance to give above and beyond what they could afford for the sheer joy of the experience. God loves this kind of generosity.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Given where you are in the campaign journey, how are you challenged or encouraged by the story of the Macedonian church?</p>
