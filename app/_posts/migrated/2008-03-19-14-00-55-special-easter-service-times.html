In recognition of the fact that we've historically been <em>packed out </em>on Easter Sunday, we're changing service times a bit this weekend. They are as follows:<br /><strong>SAT: 4:30 and 6:30PM</strong><br /><strong>SUN: 8:45, 10:30AM, 12:30PM<br /><br /></strong>(If current trends continue, we  might be forced to have one continuous 48 hour service on loop in the auditorium...just come for any 60 minutes you'd like. Hmm...)<strong><br /><br /></strong>
