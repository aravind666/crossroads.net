<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Fire Tested</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We still have the heat turned up today, you can handle it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Did you notice in the reading that the word day is capitalized? Paul is referring to a day that is coming when we will all stand before God. We all choose to do different things with our time throughout our lives, but someday there will be a moment of accountability to see how much of what we built is on Christ, and how much of what we built is on ourselves or another bad foundation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The best way to prepare for that Day is to begin to let God assess your work now. Today, ask God if you have anything not built on Christ in your life and see where he starts. (This is really something we should do in our lives regularly, if not daily.)</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Who are some people who have built into you or watered you in your life? What can you learn from them in how they did that?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Did you discover anything in your life this week not built on a good foundation?</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 2</a></p>
