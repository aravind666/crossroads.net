<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: About Control</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you see him as the source of good things, today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A11-17&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">James 4:11-17</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+29%3A11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Jeremiah 29:11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When you read something like, You dont know a thing about tomorrow...youre nothing but a wisp of fog, are you nodding with James in agreement or are you ready to punch him in the face? It can really hurt our pride to hear were not in control---or that were foolish to count on ourselves. But consider the alternative: Instead of the insane amount of pressure that comes from self-reliance and an identity tied to our gifts and performance, we get the freedom that comes with humble dependence on a King who is the source of anything good. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lets take it straight from James: Make it a habit to say, If the Master wills it and were still alive, well do this or that. Try that line the next chance you get, and see what unexpected things happen.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 3</a></p>
