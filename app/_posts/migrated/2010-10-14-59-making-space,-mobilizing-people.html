<p class="normal noPspace">If you attend Crossroads at the Oakley site at 10am or 11:45am,, you know we are out of room at our two most attractive service times. When a space reaches 80% capacity, it no longer feels welcoming to new people. Whether its at a church or a ballpark, at 80%, youre at capacity. Beyond that, while we have folks who regularly drive over an hour to come to a service, we recognize that for many Cincinnatians the risk of a 20-minute drive on a weekend for something theyve never experienced makes for a high hurdle to jump over.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Meanwhile, at our site in Mason, were seeing a community growing and flourishing as neighbors interact with neighbors. We see the power of the message of Jesus spoken in everyday language, in the context of a community of people that are already doing life together, and we want that for every community in Cincinnati.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">The Multi-site vision is about having one church, but with multiple locations. Additional sites will not only open spaces for new people at our Oakley site, but it will also enable us to draw from a larger team of people who are mobilized to change Cincinnati and the world.</p>
