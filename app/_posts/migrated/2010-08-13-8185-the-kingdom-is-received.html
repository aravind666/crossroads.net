<p>The Kingdom is Received</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to tell God you are willing to receive the Kingdom today.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%207:7-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:7-8</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%207:13-14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">13-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The people to whom Jesus spoke were accustomed to religious leaders loading them up with guilt and rules as the way to be in a relationship with God. Yet, Jesus made it a point to emphatically say that guilt, rules and obligations do not lead to knowing God, because these things shut out His love and grace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus said that God reveals himself to those who ask, and that the Kingdom is available to all who will enter. Asking and entering are other ways of saying that the Kingdom isnt earned. It is received.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to earn your way to God or into the Kingdom? Have you ever thought reading the right books or performing the right spiritual exercises would automatically lead to knowing God more? Today, remind yourself that the Kingdom is not earned, and freely receive the gifts of love and grace that God offers to you.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Kingdom of God isnt just one thing that Jesus talked about; it the only thing. As you think about what you have read this week, discuss the following questions with others. These questions are worth revisiting as you seek the Kingdom.</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you seeing the Kingdom happening in your life, in others around you, and in the world?</li>
<li>Are you trying to earn a place in the Kingdom or are you in a posture of receiving?</li>
<li>What opportunities is God giving you right now to proclaim the Kingdom to others?</li>
</ul>
