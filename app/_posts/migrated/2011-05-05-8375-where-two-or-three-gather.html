<p>Where Two or Three Gather</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Jesus, help me to hear what you say about prayer, and then help me actually do it.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:19-20&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 18:19-20</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Theres something about being in community as we seek God thats a game changer. So its not surprising that Jesus tells us amazing things will happen when two or more are gathered and pursue God in prayer. There are no Lone Rangers in the family of believers. This is equally true when it comes to prayer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>This might be outside your norm, but find someone to pray with you. Maybe its someone youre in spiritual community with, a close friend, a family member, or even a stranger. (If you go to Crossroads, theres a Prayer Team whos available after every weekend service. Just stay in your seat and wait for them to come around.) The prayer can be a simple request or an outpouring. The important thing is to experience a conversation with God in community.</p>
