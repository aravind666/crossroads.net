<p>Peace is Unusual</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me to identify places in my life where I need your peace.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Philippians%204:6-7%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 4:6-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Peace is rarely explainable or fully understandable in the worlds terms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we receive the peace Jesus offers, were usually not responding or feeling in the typical way, which is why its noticeable, why it transcends all understanding, and why it brings us closer to God. So in a time that could produce anxiety or fear, we instead trust that God has an answer beyond our understanding. We rest, fully confident in His power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe this sounds good in theory, but put it in the context of your daily life. What could it look like for you to rest, undisturbed, in Gods power?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>On your paper, make a note of something that troubles or overwhelms your mind. Then just leave it where it lays. Dont do anything with it, yet.</p>
<p></p>
