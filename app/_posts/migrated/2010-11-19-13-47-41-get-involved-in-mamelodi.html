<p class="noPspace">The main thing we need to move forward on our South Africa initiative is cash. But there will be opportunities to travel to South Africa and volunteer with our initative to improve the health care in Mamelodi. Paula and Dave Heidrich, Villa Hills residents and key South Africa volunteers, told me about where they see us headed and what their involvement in South Africa means to them.</p><p class="noPspace"><strong>Why do you believe we should do what we&rsquo;ve proposed in South Africa?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paula</span>: People and communities cannot grow and develop without some system of providing health care. Plain and simple, people there are sick and we can make a difference, a real difference in their lives. Healing the sick is one of the ways Christ showed his love.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dave</span>: The first and simplest reason is that we are called to do it. I really believe serving others is the best and greatest way that God is revealed to us.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What is our biggest challenge moving forward?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paula and Dave</span>: To avoid being the know-it-all Americans.&nbsp;It takes time to really understand the people and build relationships and trust with them.&nbsp;We need to be patient and learn to measure our successes in more ways than how we measure success at hospitals and clinics in the United States.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What are you most excited about with where we are headed?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paula</span>: Long-term change will come from our commitment to community health workers and programs, but it&rsquo;s also exciting to see the immediate and impactful change we sometimes get to make in people&rsquo;s lives, like glasses that allow them to see for the first time in a long time, or dentistry that stops months (or years) of pain, or visiting the home of a really sick person and setting them up for regular medical visits. Those are the kind of experiences that stay with you.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dave</span>: There has been a lot of groundwork laid by Crossroads volunteers over the past few years. There are a committed group of veterans who have experience on the ground over there that want to recruit and lead the future trips, sharing their passion with evermore volunteers.&nbsp; When you add in our great partnership with Charity &amp; Faith and other international relationships just now forming, it will come together to be impactful&mdash;this will change Mamelodi, but with enough involvement that it can also change Cincinnati.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What would you say to others about our work in South Africa?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paula</span>: You don&rsquo;t have to be a medical person. You don&rsquo;t have to have the Jesus thing figured out. You just need the sprit to serve people. There are plenty of roles. Whether with your money or your time, whether in Cincinnati, or on a trip.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dave</span>: Remember in elementary school when you talked about Africa?&nbsp;You used to have to spin the globe all the way around to find it. You thought it was mysterious and exciting, the ultimate big adventure. Now the adventure is available to you.&nbsp;You can be part of this effort to change this one particular spot on the globe. Never did I imagine I would be blessed with the chance to serve people (and make friends) in Africa. Come on a trip and join us as we love one another. It will change your life.</em></p>
