<p>Blockades</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see where you can take action and experience the miraculous.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%2017:20-50&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 17:20-50</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes  when were face-to-face with something that feels monstrous in our life  (marital problems, a lie we need to confess, debt), we want to avoid it  at all costs-either hoping to avoid the pain or not believing we can  get through it. But consider Davids method: 1) He heard the battle and  ran towards it. 2) He acknowledged Gods incredible power. 3) He fought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>David  wasnt ignorant--he knew he was dwarfed by Goliath; he knew it looked  crazy to outsiders. But he also knew he wasnt going to win the battle  because of his own strength. He stepped toward the monster, knowing he  was following Gods audacious call, and believing that God would honor  his action by giving him strength.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And so David experienced the miraculous.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think  of something you are terrified to do: Maybe its a conversation. Maybe  its a project for work. Maybe its finding a new job or opening up to  your kids. Write down all the reasons that you think youre going to  fail. Now write in big, bold letters over top of it "God". Carry that  paper with you to remind you that God is bigger than any reason  (legitimate or otherwise) that you may have.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
