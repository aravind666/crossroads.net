<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Truth: Love Your Neighbor</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily assumes that the Bible is only a big book about God and hes the main character. Well look at verses and mull over what it means for us if what they say is true.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to soften your heart to a difficult person in your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A12-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">JOHN 15:12-17</a></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>ASK YOURSELF</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If what Jesus is saying here is true, how do your relationships with your family, friends and even the strangers you pass on the street look different?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do one thing for another person today that costs you something---time, money, emotion--- its your pick. In short, find a way to love someone else.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 11</a></p>
