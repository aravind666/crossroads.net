<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Spring rains bring us mud puddles, leave us digging through closets for  umbrellas and jackets, and send us running inside for cover.</p>
<p>But  that spring rain alsocleanses and brings about new life from the  ground. Within days of those rains, we can see new growth of all kinds  springing out of nowhere-completely changing the world around us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  the same way, the springrain of the Spirit soaks us and quenches the  seeds beneath our soil that in time will sprout and bear fruit.  ThroughJesus, God created a way for his Spirit to be available to us  all.We can delight in His Spirit, receiving it fully and allowing  ourselves to be made new, re-created and ready to engage fully in the  season of summer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong> <br>Take a moment and ask the Holy Spirit to soak into your heart like  soil. Today spend time "soaking" in the Spirit. Be mindful of its  presence.</p>
