<p>Fightin Words</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please show me today how youve lovingly freed me from my past mistakes and burdens.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Matthew 13:1-23" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:%201-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 13:1-23</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>As you think about Jesus teaching this crowd, remember that hes talking to a group of people whose history and identity is wrapped up in God choosing them as his people. However, many among them (the religious leaders, especially) had gotten the idea that this identity was theirs by birth, by heritagenot by any sort of relationship with Jesus, other than abiding by religious laws.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus states the opposite. No wonder the religious leaders got all up in arms. He radically changed the barometer of salvation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What kind of soil you are has nothing to do with where you were born, what rules you follow or what knowledge you can spout off. Jesus says its all about how you actively respond to and receive from himhow you continually seek and listen and then apply his truth to your life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>The thing that distinguishes the good soil from the bad is its fruit. Consider what fruit that the Holy Spirit freely offers you (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control) feels most absent from your life? Ask God to fill you with that fruit, and to show you where you might be unintentionally blocking it.</p>
<p></p>
