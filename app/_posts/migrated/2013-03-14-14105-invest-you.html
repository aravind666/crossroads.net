<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">In Jesus story, God is the man at the beginning of the story. This is a story about investment, that begins with the fact that God invests in us. He does not give equally, because this isnt giving, its investing. God invests like a sound banker or stockbroker: where he sees the best possibility for return. We made note last week of our resources, remember this week that all of those are actually on loan from the Father as an investment in us.</span></p>
