<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Carry On: Eyes</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Rhythms are only as powerful as the keeping of them. We continue with Psalm 116 and we focus today on the eye.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20116:7-8&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Psalm 116:7-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Stress, anxiety and frustration can lead to a world of tears, near tears or toughening not to tear. You can be an over internalizer with your emotions, and it can begin to feel messy or numb internally. If you are an over externalizer, you might be creating relational messiness all around you. When we rest and have rhythms where we abide and receive, there is a regular rhythm of being present with ourselves--a place to check in and discover peace.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Journal a little today about how you handle emotions. Are you an over or under emoter?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2023&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 23</a></p>
