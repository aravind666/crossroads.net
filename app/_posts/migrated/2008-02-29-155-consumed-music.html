It is music composed by volunteers and staff that is being featured throughout the <a href="/media">Consumed journey</a>. Also just released (by popular request) is the <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">Consumed Series Music</a>, which is the music heard behind the pre-service loop and on other Consumed-related stuff. Enjoy!</body></html>
