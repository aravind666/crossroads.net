<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Set Apart by Grace</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to remind you of his mercy and grace.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A4-5&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 2:4-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus set himself apart by claiming to be God, forgiving sins and giving eternal life. Through it all, at the core of what Jesus said and did was grace. He freely gave it to you and to me. And thats what really makes Him unique when we line up all religions---his grace. This week, well look at the grace of Jesus and wrestle with what it means for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul writes we were dead because of our sins. But Jesus gives us life. Youve been given a clean slate. How does that affect your work or relationships? What might you do differently today?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 6</a></p>
