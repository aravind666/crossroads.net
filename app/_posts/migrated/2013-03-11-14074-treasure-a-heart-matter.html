<p class="noPspace">We are looking this week at Jesus principles on investing. Yesterday we noticed our resources and that we have a choice.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:19-21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 6:19-21</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When God created you, he knit resources into your being. He gave you your physicality to be able to work and to earn money. He gave you a mind, your sense of humor, your family of origin, and so many other gifts. We have a choice to make, and that choice matters. Not because we are so important that our choices have the ability to impact the world (although, you might).</p>

<p class="noPspace">Your choice matters because it impacts you. Wherever you place your resources and invest them, those are the stats you will be keeping your eye on, and your heart will be there, too. When we invest our resources, we are setting an end destination marker for our heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yesterday, we made a list of resources that God has given us. Today, note where you are investing those resources. Give a score 1-10. 1 being that you are now investing this resource totally in things that rot, and 10 being you have invested that resource totally in the eternal.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
