<p>Risk</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2025:14-30&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 25:14-30</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When you think of God, what words come to mind? Father? Savior? Judge? Tyrant? Lover? Warrior?</p>
<p></p>
<p>How about Gambler?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thats probably not at the top of the list. Yet, if Jesus parable is accurate, then God is exactly that. God rewards risk. He cheers and blesses those who are willing to risk failure. When we put our effort and resources into things for His kingdom that arent a guaranteed success, we can know that he is standing behind us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gods judgment doesnt come on those who risk and fail; it comes on those who lacked the trust to risk at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the idea of God as risk-taker make you feel?</li>
<li>Have you ever risked something for God before? How did you feel afterward?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We follow a God who takes risks, plain and simple. As we follow Him, we will inevitably find ourselves in similar situations; we will begin to see opportunities to trust him enough to risk. Ask God to show you situations where he wants you to take a chance, and to help you be aware of them when they come.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Deuteronomy%2031:6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Deuteronomy 31:6</a> <br><br>__________________________________ <br><strong> <br>Week 2 Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We spent some time this week talking about pretty practical stuff out of these storiesforgiveness, prayer, loving others, and being prepared.</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific areas is God challenging you to be more prepared or more loving?</li>
<li>How does the idea of prayer being hard work make you feel? Why?</li>
<li>What areas of your life do you have the easiest time forgiving people? The hardest? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We also saw a picture of God that is a bit unusualGod as a risk-taker.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this picture of God compare with how you usually see him?</li>
<li>How is God challenging you to risk for (or with, actually) him?</li>
</ul>
