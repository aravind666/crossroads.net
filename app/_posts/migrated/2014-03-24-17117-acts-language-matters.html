<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">During a holiday, a pretty unusual thing happens to the disciples---the Holy Spirit shows up as a violent wind and leaves them all speaking in different languages. Confused, intrigued or plain not impressed, other people started to gather where the disciples were hanging out because the wind was so loud. Peter and the others used this occasion to tell the crowd all about Jesus in languages they could actually understand, convincing them to become followers of Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of someone you could tell about Jesus. Theres no pressure to get them here on Sunday, but consider the language and environment theyll hear it best, whether thats this week or in this decade.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 6</a></p>
