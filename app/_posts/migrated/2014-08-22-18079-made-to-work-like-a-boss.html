<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Made to Work Like a Boss</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether you are looking for a job, studying toward a job, or working out of your home, work is an essential part of the human experience designed by God for your benefit. During this series, well explore different parts of the Bible that all point toward the fundamental goodness of work.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:15&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When God created mankind, he didnt give them a jungle, he gave them a garden. He then gave them a role in that garden. If fruit trees go unpruned and unattended, the fruit gets smaller and smaller until its simply a flowering tree. If there are no humans to care for it then there is no fruit needed. God made man to engage the planet through work, work that bears fruit and is good.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2090:17&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 90:17</a> as a prayer to God. Make this your prayer for the week. Write it and carry it with you or post it where you can see it this week.</p>
