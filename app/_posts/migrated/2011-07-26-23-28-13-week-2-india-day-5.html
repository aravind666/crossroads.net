<p class="noPspace">Day 5</p>
<p class="noPspace">We started the day early as we had a drive into the countryside.  We saw waterfalls, beautiful fields of rolling green hills and lots of animals on the road (cows, donkeys, chickens, dogs, etc).  Jamie and Muriella joined us from Crossover.  We also picked up Duane Wiehunt from Sower of Seeds, as he and his wife Leslie were our hosts at Bombay Teen Challenge (BTC).  We also met with Donnelle who works for BTC and who recently was at Crossroads working with volunteers.  BTC was impressive as they had a variety of different established homes for those in need.  We visited three locations. The first was an orphanage for 60 boys and girls under 15 who all have HIV and some full-blown AIDS and are the children of trafficked girls who’ve all died under the age of 30.  We confirmed that children all over the world love candy!  They were thrilled to see us, made special cards for each of us and grabbed our hands as we walked in the door.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Then, we went to BTC’s campus living center where 75 teen girls/women and 85 teen boys/men live. The guys had been homeless or addicted to drugs, and most of the girls/women had been trafficked. They get counseling, tutoring to help them pass the grade level exams to eventually go to school, and vocational training. We saw them sewing purses/clothing, making leather products (some of which are being sold to Target in the US) and jewelry.  We have an opportunity to learn and reapply what has been done by this organization.</p>
<p class="noPspace">We went to a campus living center for over 100 street children and visited one of two homes for the daughters of women who had been or are working in the red light district.  We also had the opportunity to hear about how they staff, fund, educate and support the breadth of their organization.  The girls had several options to learn a trade. </p>
<p class="noPspace">Finally, we went to a home of about 75 girls about 13-16 years old who were all daughters of trafficked girls. They had been there for an average of 10 years. They welcomed us in, asked us all to sit down in chairs, and came to each one of us to introduce themselves in English. Then THEY led us in worship, singing several songs in Hindi and English about being FREE. After that, they prayed boldly out loud at the same time. Some of us could not hold back the tears. God has broken the cycle for them. They have a chance to live an abundant life of freedom. It was just overwhelming that these girls could come from such a desperate situation and praise God with all their hearts. Before we left, we got to pray individually with many of the girls.</p>
<p class="noPspace">We had a long ride back to the hotel – another long day!  We were out in the city in the evening and the monsoon rains started so we had the opportunity to ride in rickshaws. They had no doors and were very small but we had 3 people ride in each.  We hope to share pictures on tomorrow’s blog.  It’s after midnight so time to get some sleep!</p>
