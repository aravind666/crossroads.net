<strong>Friday, January 8</strong><br>Wisdoms Invitation<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you. </em><br><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Proverbs 8<br><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong><br>This chapter of Proverbs is actually a poem about wisdom. In the poem, wisdom is personified as a woman calling out to all who will listen and respond. We also see that wisdom was present at the time of creation and that God blesses those who respond to wisdoms call. So how can we continually respond to wisdoms call? Here are some practical reminders:<br><ul><li>
<strong>Connect and listen.</strong> We are more likely to hear from God when were intentionally listening. Reliance on God as the giver of wisdom is essential to our growth.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Act on the truth we receive.</strong> There are areas where the Bibles meaning will be unclear to us, but if we act on what is clear we will grow in wisdom.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Be in community with others who are seeking God.</strong> We learn from sharing our successes and struggles with trusted community. Maybe this is joining a group or just being more open and intentional within existing friendships.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Make aggressive mistakes!</strong> There are things we will only learn through trial and error. Dont let choices paralyze you. Instead, see mistakes as a tool for growing in wisdom, and trust God to redirect you as needed.</li></ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>If you were to pick one of these areas to grow in this year, what would it be and why? Ask God to show you what steps to take and write them in your journal.<br><br><strong>A FURTHER LOOK</strong><br>John 16:5-15<br>_______________________________<br><strong><br>Week One Discussion Questions</strong><br><br>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content.
