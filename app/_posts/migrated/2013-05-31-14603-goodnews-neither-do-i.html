<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodnews: Neither do I</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out our week of looking at how Jesus gives grace and truth through a story in John.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:2-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 8:2-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This was a heightened situation as the super religious Pharisees attempted to back Jesus into a corner. Can you feel the tension as they wait to see if he judges and throws stones or if he releases her and permits her sin? Jesus is bigger than that. The world will continue to create polarizing battles that pull people into divisive corners, but Jesus unites. The battle is truth vs. grace--or the world would stigmatize even further to say condemnation vs. permission. Jesus is truth and grace. Jesus says, I have the right to condemn, but dont. Go and leave your life of sin.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Journal today on whether you are more likely to default to truth or grace, both in your attitude toward others and toward yourself. Ask God to show you how it looks to be both.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11</a></p>
