<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>A Change is Gonna Come</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to prepare your heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A1-5&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:1-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We spend too much time talking about and judging other people instead of considering our own faults. This makes you and I hypocrites. But if we want to follow Jesus and remake our lives to look like his, we have to turn inward. This week were going to spend time with God and with people we trust to find out how we can change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pick a person you are quick to judge. Today, try not to do that. This might be harder than you expect, but thats OK. Nobody says pulling a log out of your eye is easy.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 1</a></p>
