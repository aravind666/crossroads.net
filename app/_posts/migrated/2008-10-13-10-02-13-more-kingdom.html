<html><body><p>We're in a series on the Kingdom called <a href="/my/media/viewSeries.php?seriesID=133">Unlock(ed)</a> in which we're looking at God's plans for his creation and how we can all engage in them. For those of us wanting to explore more about the Kingdom and what it means, here are a few additional resources and series from the Crossroads archives:<br><br><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/legacy/content/next-level.jpg" alt="Next Level" hspace="10" width="90" height="90" align="left">A few years ago we invited one of our favorite teachers, <strong>Greg Boyd</strong>, to visit Crossroads and teach us about the Kingdom. In this four-week series Greg talks in very practical ways about how we can engage. <a href="/my/media/viewSeries.php?seriesID=134">LISTEN TO THE SERIES</a><br><br><br><br><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/legacy/content/kingdom.jpg" alt="Kingdom" hspace="10" width="90" height="90" align="left">In 2007 Crossroads embarked on an all-church journey to experiment with the Kingdom and to see what would happen if we all lived as if it were a reality. It was a radical call to engage the world around us in a new way - a way based on Jesus' teachings. <a href="/my/media/viewSeries.php?seriesID=112">LISTEN TO THE SERIES</a><br></p></body></html>
