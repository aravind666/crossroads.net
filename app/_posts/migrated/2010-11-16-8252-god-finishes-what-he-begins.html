<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God finishes what he begins. These words are cause for celebration and hope as we think about the big challenges Gods calling us to tackle as a community--and in our individual lives. No matter how great the challenge, we can bank on the fact that God finishes what he begins and his grace never runs out.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of one challenge you are facing right now. Thank God for his ability to finish the good work hes started in you.</p>
