<p class="noPspace">Today was amazing.......seriously.&nbsp; Today I found out that the group we have can handle anything.&nbsp; Our plan was to go to the Vasai Baptist Church to worship, then conduct a Kids Camp with the children from the church.&nbsp; Well, with most things India....the schedule changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; What should have been a 30 minute drive, turned in to an almost 2 hour drive (because of traffic on a Sunday morning........traffic pops up on all days at all times).</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">So we caught the last 15 mins of the worship service.&nbsp; It was simple, but powerful.&nbsp; Worshiping with brothers and sisters 9000 miles away is a unifying experience.....and makes me realize just how awesome our God is.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Then the plan was to have about 30 mins to travel down the street to set up for our Kids Camp.&nbsp; Well, we showed up and to our surprise there were already 50 kids waiting on us..........in a semi-open classroom.....in the pooring rain!&nbsp; I came close to freakin&rsquo; out, but everyone else launched in to action.&nbsp; I was certainly proud of our group.&nbsp; I tried to upload a picture of what we were contending with.....but it won&rsquo;t load.&nbsp; All I can say is that I have never in my life been in such a pounding rain for such an extended period of time.&nbsp; It was crazy.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Colleen Crawford led the Kids Camp and did an absolutely amazing job.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know Colleen outside of this trip, but what she did today shows me alot about the person she is.&nbsp; Her and the entire team pulled off a great Kids Camp and helped launch a relationship with a church who we hope will partner with us in the future for the work here in India.&nbsp; It was a great start.</p>

<p class="noPspace">As we left our new friends, it struck me that while I drive around this sometimes crazy, completely foreign city and think our two cultures are so different in so many ways..........I realized today that the similarities far outway the differences.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Tomorrow we meet with the pastors of the children we interacted with today.&nbsp; If today was any indication......it&rsquo;s gonna be a great day!</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Until tomorrow......</p>
