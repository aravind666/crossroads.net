<p>The Path of Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Tell God about a decision youre in the middle of making, large or small. Ask for His wisdom as you move forward.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108941245442&amp;s=0&amp;e=001A6bfI3PbI_RasajKiH4e8UazS4sjS-lh3OOVbYHMxpJF82QKu82BA0Gjr6w9S9kkiU_8Euq9Ri73yHOYWPHBujuMfBQdA0GtxptV9-FLuplDPigo7OLYbXM5MqmuGRqhZSChte3bzKwWSTxOkkgBpPa0Z9R15u26arIgRZbrnwGiSQ4LLg36OAfJYvO0HHdOGdKBoxOklM-wqZcE7IQgxKG25Z1Ogst8" target="_blank">John 16:33</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Peace  isnt the avoidance of problems. Peace is the ability to flourish even  in the midst of our problems. Because although well sometimes  experience serenity and ease in life, Jesus tells us we will also suffer  and be challenged.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider  the Christmas story. The Bible says Joseph and Mary were incredibly  afraid, experienced public humiliation, risked nearly everything they  had--yet they did what God commanded. They chose obedience over the  worlds measure of comfort. They trusted Gods promise that we will  flourish when were fully engaged in what were created to do and be.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Think about someone who could use some encouragement in the midst of struggle. Encourage them today, as soon as you can.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weekly Discussion Questions<br></strong></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Choose one of the following questions to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe  any time in your life when you felt peace, even if it didnt look  "peaceful" or easy from the outside (i.e. relationships, career moves,  children, health, living situations). What helped you through that time?</li>
<li>God  says we find peace through obedience. Is there something youre doing  right now out of intentional obedience to God verses comfort?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
