<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Humility</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><em>This summer, were revisiting some classic Daily topics. Even if you have a photographic memory, these are worth digesting again.</em></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As we continue to study the book of James, were learning what James has to teach us about humility.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 4:1-10</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What causes fights and quarrels among you? Dont they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. You adulterous people, dont you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us? But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says:</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God opposes the proud</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Just like the believers James was addressing in this passage, the desire to have our own way can make us feel distant from God. This week, well look at what it means to let go of our own motives and find peace in humility.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, you are so powerful and so loving. Please show me specific ways to humble myself before you this week.</p>
