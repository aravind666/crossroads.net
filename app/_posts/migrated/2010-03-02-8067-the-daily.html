<p>God's Desire  for You</p></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><em><span>Today's  edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekend's message for you to keep in mind as you  work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</span></em></p>

<p><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br>REFLECT</span></strong></p>
<p><span>How  would you complete this sentence?</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>The  main thing God wants is for me to be __________.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Good? Moral?  Nice? More religious?</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Today's scripture  recounts how Jesus announced his own ministry. If we want to discover what God wants for us, there's nowhere better to look than Jesus' own  words. He said he came "to proclaim freedom" and "to release the oppressed."</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Remember: God  wants you to be free.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br>PRAY</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ask  God to bring you into increasing measures of freedom today, and to lead the  process you're going through in your Free guide and small group.</span></p>
