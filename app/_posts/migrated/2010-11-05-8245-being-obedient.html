<p>Being Obedient</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to show you what obedience looks like. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%207:21-23&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:21-23</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Jesus tells his followers that what they say matters littleinstead, its what they do in obedience that counts. We are called to follow through on the things God tells us, not just pay those things lip service.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you areas of your life where what you say you believe doesnt line up with your actions. Are there places where you arent following through on what you know to be right?</p>
