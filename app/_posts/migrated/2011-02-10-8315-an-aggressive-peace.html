<p><strong>Thursday, February 10 </strong><br>An Aggressive Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God thank you for your presence in my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2046&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 46</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>What is peace?</p>
<p></p>
<p>We hear a lot about the lack of it; its all over the news these days. Regardless of the context, though, it is almost always described as something dependent on us. Peace becomes the absence of conflict, and its dependent on our action.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What are we doing about it? Where should we be going? How can we help?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet David makes it fairly clear that peace is something of Gods doing, not ours. It is God who puts an end to war and conflict. Yet more than that, peace is the wholeness of life and joy that comes when God himself is present.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>The songwriter here says that the God of Israel is our fortress. In the midst of the conflict of our daily lives, it can be difficult to see him that way. Take a couple of minutes and ask God to show you today how he is your fortress.</p>
