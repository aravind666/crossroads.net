<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>There  is a traditional Hebrew word used in Passover meals: Dayenu, which  means,"it would have been enough and Im thankful." When we are in the  spring season with God, it is a good time to form a rhythm of  gratitude-a habit that can carry on into the other seasons of the year.  Thankfulness is the greatest weapon we have against greed, selfishness,  entitlement, depression and worry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Giving  thanks is easiest during this season, when we are so close to  experiencing Gods new love, a new awe of him, and his rescue and  redemption.</p>
<p>The  Israelites said "Dayenu" in response to the Lord rescuing them out of  Egypt, feeding them in the desert, and giving them the holy day of  Passover. We can create our own list of Dayenu: it would have been enough and Im thankful.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write  a thankfulness list to God. Think through your life up to present day,  writing things for which you are thankful. Try out the word "Dayenu," or  write out: It would have been enough and Im thankful.</p>
