<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>A Signal in Scripture</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were exploring how God might speak to each of us. Today, well spend some time listening for God in scripture.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to reveal something to you through his written words.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">Hebrews 4:12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Sometimes it seems that hearing from God is a pretty hard thing to do or that God isnt talking to us. When we feel this way, the best place we can turn to is the Bible. Its full of words that tell us about who we are, how we can face the challenges in front of us, and most importantly who God is. Whenever were unsure about what God might be saying to us, scripture has a unique way of pointing out what were thinking and whats on our heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend a bit more time reading the Bible. Pick a book (we recommend <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+1&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">Psalm 1</a>) and read a few verses. What is the main message of what you read? What does it mean to you? Keep in mind, God is talking to you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">1 Corinthians 16</a></p>
