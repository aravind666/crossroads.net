<p>This weekend during services, Brian Tome shared&nbsp;the news that Crossroads and Charity &amp; Faith Mission Church have jointly decided to end their organizational partnership, including our GO Mamelodi trips. Despite this development, Crossroads will continue to pursue the medical component of the Game Change Campaign with other partners. This<a title=\"Mamelodi FAQ\" href=\"https&#58;//www.crossroads.net/uploadedfiles/mamelodi_update_faq.pdf\">&nbsp;FAQ</a>&nbsp;provides details about our decision to end the partnership.&nbsp;If you have more questions, visit the&nbsp;<a title=\"GO Mamelodi\" href=\"https&#58;//www.crossroads.net/gomamelodi\">GO Mamelodi&nbsp;</a>page&nbsp;for information on the&nbsp;<strong>South Africa Update Meeting</strong> taking place on Wednesday, March 2 at 7pm in the Oakley Auditorium. &nbsp;</p>
