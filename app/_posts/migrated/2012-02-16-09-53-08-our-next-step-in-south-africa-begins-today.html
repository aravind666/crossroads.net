<p class="noPspace">Today, 32 Crossroads people head to South Africa. This is our first official trip to South Africa since 2010 and it&rsquo;s a HUGE step. We&rsquo;ll be splitting our time between Grace Bible Church and the Topsy Foundation, where we&rsquo;ll provide dental care to those living in poverty and run retreats for the staffs of both organizations. We&rsquo;ll also host a breakfast to celebrate and encourage 160 grandmothers who have stepped up to care for orphans in the AIDS-ravaged rural areas around Topsy. The most important thing we will do, however, is to get people from Crossroads and our potential partners to spend quality time together to build relationships, see if we can work together effectively, and discern if God is calling us to a common vision.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">If you have a moment, please support this team with your prayers over the next 10 days. We pray for safe travels and smooth logistics, but also that God shows up on this trip in a big way and guides us and our South African friends in a way that we can realize Ephesians 2:19-22:</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God&rsquo;s people and members of God&rsquo;s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.&nbsp;</em></p>
