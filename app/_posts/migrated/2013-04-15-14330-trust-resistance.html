<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out our week looking at a key verse in Isaiah. Today, we look at our response to the ending.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2030:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">Isaiah 30:15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you have been reading The Daily all week, you can begin to taste the deliciousness of repentance and rest, and the power in trusting and strength. If you can feel the goodness of that, you can also feel the thunk of the final phrase. Isaiah is calling out those refusing to live in Gods ways.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Dissonance happens anytime we hold two conflicting ideas at the same time. Its an uncomfortable feeling, and we frequently live there when we say we trust God, but our actions dont reflect that trust.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make a list today of times when you have trusted God, then finish out with listing ways you want to grow in trusting more.</p>
