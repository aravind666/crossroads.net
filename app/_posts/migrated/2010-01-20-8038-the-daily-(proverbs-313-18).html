<p><strong>Wednesday, January 20</strong><br>The Blessed Life<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Proverbs 3:13-18<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>It would be really nice if following Jesus automatically meant you were showered with financial blessing, were granted every desire off your wish list, and never had to work for any of it.<br><br>Unfortunately, it doesnt.<br><br>However, the Bible does make it clear that God cares for and blesses (in whatever way he chooses) those who follow him. So while living a wise life does not guarantee that God will bless us, it puts us in the best position to receive the blessings he provides.</p>
<ul>
<li>How has God blessed you in the past because of a wise choice?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is one way that living wisely enables us to make the most of Gods blessings?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>God values our choice to be a good manager of the resources that he has already given. Think about the ways that God has blessed you (or flip back to the list you made this week), and ask Him to show you one way that you can invest that blessing in others. <br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Psalm 1</p>
