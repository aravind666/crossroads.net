<p>Moving into the Miraculous</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see where you can take action and experience the miraculous.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2014:22-33&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 14:22-33</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We often hear the walking-on-water story as a teaching on faith. But theres something else to consider about this story, and its captured in the simple line: Peter got down out of the boat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So youre out wakeboarding on the Ohio River. Youre suddenly hit by hurricane winds that pin your boat against Serpentine Wall. And then theres Jesus, coming at you. Nothing ordinary about this situation. But would you be one of the guys who holds onto the side of the boat, terrified, and talks about the crazy thing thats happening? (This is still a measure of faith.) Or would you get up and move toward it because you wanted to be closer to the experience?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter moved into the miraculous. His faith wasnt just spoken; it was acted upon. And this week well look at more stories of people who left their seats to pursue Gods power.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>The next time youre hearing about or experiencing something miraculous, ask God to increase your faith and help you walk boldly into his power.</p>
