<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodness: Ennobling</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out the four week series on Good Sex this week, while looking at a passage that has a little something for everyone.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:1-2&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5:1-2</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we approach sex we can look at it as a partaker--what can I get? Or we can begin to view the topic of sexuality not just through our individual eyes, but as a community, a society, a body. The elevated perspective of how God uniquely has created you to be about ennobling sex in your community can change the view and use of sex in our world. Consumers deplete resources (and in this case, deplete people). What if, instead of consumeristic, you were a sexual ennobler, bringing higher value to sexuality and others?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Journal about ways that you might view or participate in self-focus in your approach to sex. Even if you arent having sex right now, you can answer this from how you are viewing it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 12</a>.</p>
