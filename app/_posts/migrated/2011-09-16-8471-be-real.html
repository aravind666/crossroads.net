<p>Be Real</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes talking to God about whats been going on in your daily life.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its been said that courage isnt the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When  you consider Paul, and his self-described timidity, you realize that  while fear most certainly existed as he traveled around the ancient  world sharing the dangerous message of Jesus, his fear was overshadowed  by the courage and conviction he had about spreading that important  message. And because of his courage, we sit here today, two thousand  years later, men and women who have heard and received Jesus because of  men and women like Paul. Paul decided something else was more important  than fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Chasing  after Jesus and living that adventure doesnt mean youll never have  fear again, but Jesus message of hope is more important than the fear  of rejection, ridicule or persecution.</p>
<p>Are  you being called to do something that terrifies you? Write it down,  then ask God to fill you with the courage you need to step into the  adventure he has planned for you. </p>
