<p>Welcome to The Daily. <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Monday, November 23<br></strong>Built on a Solid Foundation<strong><br><br></strong><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><strong><br>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 2:19-22<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>You are citizens. Family. A part of Gods house.<br><br>All of these descriptions are significant ideas for people who previously had been excluded from Gods blessing. All of us have been excluded or left out at some point in our lives, just as the Gentile (or non-Jewish) readers of Pauls letter had been.<br><br>Yet when we decide to follow Jesus, we are given a new foundation for life. With Jesus as the center, we become part of the house where God lives.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>How does it make you feel to know that you are the place where God lives?</li>
<li>What is the role of this new foundation in your relationship with Jesus?</li>
<li>How does this new foundation affect the way you see others?</li>
</ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Sometime today while youre driving or walking, notice the foundations of the buildings and trees around you. If you have some extra time, get up close to a building or tree, and touch the roots or concrete and feel the solidity of them. Pray a simple prayer of gratitude; maybe something like, God, thank you for the foundation you give me or God, thank you for making me part of your house.</body></html>
