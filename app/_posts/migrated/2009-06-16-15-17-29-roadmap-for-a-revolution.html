<a href="../images/uploadedImages/RevolutionMap.jpg" title="Roadmap (really big JPEG)"><img src="../images/uploadedImages/roadmap445w.jpg" alt="Roadmap for a Revolution" title="Roadmap for a Revolution" width="445" height="297" /></a><br /><br />Some folks have asked for the map Steven and David are using on their road trip (have you seen <a href="../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=883" title="Road Trip Week 5">the latest installment</a>?) If you want to download a copy of the map for yourself, <a href="../images/uploadedImages/RevolutionMap.pdf" title="Roadmap (PDF)">here's a PDF</a> (formatted for one-page printing), or you can click the image above for a really large JPEG. You know, in case you want to print a poster for your bedroom.
