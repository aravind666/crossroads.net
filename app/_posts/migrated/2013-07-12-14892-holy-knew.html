<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Holy: Knew</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are looking this week at how God is Holy, and how--well--were not. Well be reflecting in one passage all week.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:29-30&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:29-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This whole section begins with God knew. Lets stop right there. It would change our lives if we believed that God knew--knew what he was doing, knew the bigger plan, knew us, knew what was best for our lives and the lives of all of humanity and creation. The first step in understanding how impressive Gods knowing is, is to realize how that compares to what we know, or dont know.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lectio Divina is an ancient practice of meditating on Gods word. Lets try it with the opening sentence of todays passage. Say it to yourself, then restate it with an emphasis on different words each time. GOD knew what he was doing from the very beginning. God KNEW what he was doing from the very beginning. Dont just say it--really think about what this sentence means.</p>
