<p>Where Else Would I Be?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to have peace when you do things that I dont fully understand.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway Luke 2:41-52" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:41-52&amp;version=NIV">Luke 2:41-52</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This is worse than losing your kid at Wal-Mart or Disneyworld.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus parents left and went home. And when they realized He wasnt around, they hurried back to town (as fast as you can go on a donkey). Three days without their son, and then they found him in a temple, of all places.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As interesting as this story isgiving us a glimpse of Jesus family life and relationshipsits Jesus response thats so intriguing. He essentially says, Where else would you expect me to be? But He wasnt pulling the sassy teenager card. He was revealing a clear understanding of his identity and mission. (It just wasnt what His parents expected.) </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We probably dont think about it often, but were in a relationship with a God who is far beyond our understanding or comprehension. (And thats a good thing.) So we can have expectations, but there are times when God will absolutely blow through them and do something entirely unique. Take a few minutes to ask God to help you experience his peace as you rely on his perfect provision and timing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
