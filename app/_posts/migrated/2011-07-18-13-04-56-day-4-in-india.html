<p class=\"noPspace\">Day 4 in India........was just like the first 3, freakin&rsquo; awesome!</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Today we had 23 baptist pastors join us for a pastors conference where we hoped to initiate some relationships with some churches that could come along side of us in our endeavors over here.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me if I told you how smoothly today went.&nbsp; We worshiped in english, we worshiped in Hindi.&nbsp; We heard testimony from a 75 yr old Indian gentleman who lost all 7 of his children and minutes before his wife passed away......she brought him to Christ.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty sure there wasn&rsquo;t a dry eye in the house. (oh, and that gentleman traveled 8 hrs one way to be with us). &nbsp;We ate meals together, we shared pastoring ideas, and tomorrow we will be heading out in the city to pray with them in their ministry fields.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The 2 events that we hosted (the Kids Camp and the Pastors conference) seriously could not have gone any better than they did.&nbsp; There was most certainly divine presence at both events.&nbsp; And again our group was absolutely phenominal.&nbsp; We held 3 workshops in the afternoon for the pastors (worship, children&rsquo;s ministry, and pastoral care).&nbsp; Brothers and sisters in Christ spent 3 hours sharing ideas and concepts about ministry.......it was pretty stinkin&rsquo; cool.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Tomorrow starts some more challenging days where we&rsquo;ll be heading out in the city, we&rsquo;ll be visiting some balwadis (daycare homes for disadvantaged children) and then we&rsquo;ll be visiting a couple aftercare homes on Wednesday.&nbsp; These aftercare homes are the focal point of our work here.&nbsp; These homes (and the young women in them) are where God has called our community.&nbsp; As the India initiative moves forward, there will be aftercare homes constructed, and lives restored.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get to meet firsthand the girls who God has called us to help.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe we actually get to be a part of that.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The next few days will be tiring, but powerful.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll keep you updated!</p>
