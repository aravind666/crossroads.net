<p>Favoritism</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, open my eyes to seeing where I play favorites and where I might be short-changing others.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%202:8-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:8-13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>James warns us in these verses that favoritism can show itself in subtle ways. Who gets your special attention when youre at work, or school, or out with a new group of friends? Is it the most talented person? The most well-liked? The person who can return the favor? James warns us to remember that God doesnt value the same things that we do. He doesnt define us by our 401K or by the way we look or by the commission we made last month. Were defined as His children, wonderfully and uniquely made. And we should reflect His love for all.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God for his eyes this week. Whether youre working in your office, picking up dinner or driving through your neighborhood, pray that God would help you see people as he sees them. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
