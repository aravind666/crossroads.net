<p class="noPspace">The Vine: Rhythms</p>

<p class="noPspace">Weve looked at Jesus vine-and-branches teaching this week in snippets. Today, read it in its entirety.</p>

<p class="noPspace">READ</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:1-17&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">John 15:1-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace">REFLECT</p>
<p class="noPspace">There are so many rhythms in this teaching: pruning and fruit, loving and being loved, obedience and freedom. But theres still another one. Jesus is asking us to live under his commands in this new rhythm of life. But he wants us to ask him, too. Jesus as the vine has given us a way to connect with the Father. If we ask, in Jesus name, or in relation to Him, he wants to answer us. Friends dont always give, servants do. Friends ask as well.</p>

<p class="noPspace">RESPOND</p>
<p class="noPspace">Do you ask God for the things that you want or need? Ask him for something today that is in keeping with Jesus character.</p>

<p class="noPspace">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </p>
<p class="noPspace">You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</p>
<li>How do you respond to seasons of spiritual pruning?</li>
<li>How do you handle seasons of fruit, do you take credit, give credit? Do you remain connected to God?</li>
<li>Share where in your life you want more joy.</li>

<p class="noPspace">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print"> Matthew 27</a></p>
