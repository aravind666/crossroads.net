<p class="noPspace"><strong>Awaited Peace: Piercing</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to look at peace in the middle of the Advent season. Today, were looking at the same passage as yesterday, with a focus on what Simeon says to Mary at the end of the story.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Simeon communicates to Mary that God has not only revealed the Messiah (and the greater role he would play), but even a little of how things would go down. Jesus was the Prince of Peace, but that didnt mean he would be received peacefully. The truth of Jesus identity was, and continues to be, very divisive. You can choose to receive Gods peace through Jesus, and let Gods Spirit pierce your soul like Mary, or you dont, and you are in opposition to God.<strong>RESPOND</strong>Picture God performing surgery on your spiritual heart. What would he see in there?</p>
