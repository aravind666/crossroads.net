<p>How to Pray</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to show you how he wants to be a father to you.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its easy to say the words of the Lords Prayer. Many of us even know it by heart. But to pray it is another story. And one that has revolutionary implications. So for the next two weeks, well look at what this prayer reveals about God and how were choosing his mission when we pray it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To start off, calling this prayer the Lords Prayer might seem like a misnomer. It is really our prayer to the Lordyour prayer, if youve chosen to follow Jesus. In it, we find our personal identity as His son or daughter. We also embrace a personal mission to love God and to make his name loved.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When saying the Lords Prayer, the our and we might make the words feel more distant than a more intimate use of me and my. What if the first part went like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>My Father in Heaven, let me love you and make your name loved by everyone I meet. Let your kingdom and will be done, in me and through me, physically and spiritually.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try praying it this way today, and see how it changes the weight of familiar words.</p>
