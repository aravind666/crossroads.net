<p><strong>Friday, March 19<br></strong>Released<br><br><em>Todays edition of The Daily focuses on an original song written for the Free journey by Robbie Reider. Follow along with the lyrics while you listen to the song. Ask God to meet you during this time, and to speak to your heart about the freedom he has in store for you. </em> <br><br><br><strong>From Robbie:<br></strong>This song was inspired by a friend who carries a lot of weight on his shoulders: his job, family, personal expectations, desire to break habits. I imagined what I thought God would say to him about all the weight he carries. I imagined my friend as a farmer (weird, because my friend is NOTHING like a farmer), and heres why: its a farmers responsibility to prepare soil and plant seeds, but not to produce fruit. So I think God would say: its not yours to grow, not yours to carry, not yours to fully comprehend. And Im no different from my friend. I carry weight that was never mine to carry. Im just a farmer. Arent we all?<br><br><br><strong>Lyrics:<br></strong><em>Its not yours to grow<br> Its not yours to carry<br> Its not yours to fully comprehend<br> Its not yours to control<br><br> Its not yours to defend<br> Its not yours to justify<br> Its not yours sustain indefinitely<br> Its not yours to mend<br><br> Your hands, so small, arent the hands of God<br> And the weight they carry will surely kill you<br> You have been released<br> You have been released  <br> Now that you have the life of the free<br> Wont you unlock me with your key?<br><br> Its your place to release<br> Those youve held your hand against<br> Though theyve stolen from and broken you in two<br> Its time for you to forgive<br><br> Your hands, so small, could be the hands of God<br> And the weight they carry could give you life<br><br> You have been released<br> You have been released<br> Now that you have the life of the free<br> Wont you unlock me with your key? </em> <br><br><br><strong>Listen:<br></strong><a href="/downloads/playMedia.php?idMedia=1026">Click here</a> to listen to Released.</p>
