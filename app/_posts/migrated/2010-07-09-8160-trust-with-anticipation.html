<p>Trust with Anticipation</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: God, give me the trust to believe that you answer my prayers to you.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%2012:5-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 12:5-16</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The prayers for Peter to be freed from prison were answered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With an angel in front of him, Peter walks right out of prison. Meanwhile, the very folks who were praying for him dont notice the answer to their prayer when it literally knocks at their door. What kind of trust were they praying with if they werent looking for the answer to arrive? What a good God who answers our prayers even when we arent looking for him to really come through.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter trusts God even as it leads him to prison, and God also provides the way out. We need to learn to trust God in spite of our circumstances.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to increase your trust, and sit quietly and receive what he gives you. Anticipate that He will answer your prayer.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong><br>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though Peter denied knowing Jesus, Jesus didnt lose his faith in Peter. When Peter turned back, he follows Jesus calling to feed my sheep. He is emboldened by the Spirit, and begins to lead the movement that brings thousands to Christ. He continues to heal and is freed from prison through trust-filled prayers.</p>
<ul>
<li>With someone you choose to trust, share a failure that you have previously feared disqualifies you from Gods love.</li>
<li>Pray for someone in your life, in specific ways, with the expectation that God will answer.</li>
</ul>
