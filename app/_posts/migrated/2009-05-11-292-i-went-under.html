<html><body><div>Congrats to everyone who decided that they wanted to mark their faith in Jesus and make a public declaration by being baptized this weekend. Many of us decided "in the moment" that it was something we wanted to do.<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">If you were one of these "in the moment" people, would you mind sharing a little about your experience this weekend and why you decided to be baptized?<br><br></span>
