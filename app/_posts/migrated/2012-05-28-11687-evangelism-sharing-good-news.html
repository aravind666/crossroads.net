<p class="noPspace">Monday, May 28<br><strong>Evangelism: Sharing Good News</strong><br><br>This week, were learning about evangelism by studying the apostle Pauls words to the Colossians</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong><br>"We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all his people--the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true word of the gospelthat has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world--just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood Gods grace.You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,and who also told us of your love in the Spirit."<br><em>Colossians 1:3-8 <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001KF3WEvGqNyGoj7cOc24ji3-vFKfVJ4KEb8nH2HzCCFki9ysecc4WJUGYQUVRnE5f_EtMSIjKus1puZD4zXipGnVp9Jaje_WHhV7GRiiB5nouTKv0SQINUGk2SsQJ4Xtx3LMUgS2Lg6NQzJicd3sFdIi78aQKBPVcmkLDKoUe_lFNBuufdZ0sLEZUhHQSX0Fl" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>The word "evangelism" has become loaded with religious overtones, but it comes from a Greek word that simply means "good news." Evangelizing is simply sharing the good news about something you love. Well learn about evangelism this week by studying the above passage, written from the apostle Paul to believers in the city of Colossae. <br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Think about the things youre constantly sharing with friends. Your favorite TV shows? A new band? The latest dining spot on Vine Street? Its helpful to begin diving into this concept of evangelism by considering how we already evangelize to people around us. <br><br><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong><br>Todays reading is:<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001KF3WEvGqNyGoj7cOc24ji3-vFKfVJ4KEb8nH2HzCCFki9ysecc4WJUGYQUVRnE5f_EtMSIjKus1puZD4zXipGnVp9Jaje_WHhV7GRiiB5nrR-B-9NbY1PzRwdDAZ3jdPq9GRQFzp2gc3nGFJtoeB12k1jiplK9L85nhjltVAq8vZKbcsfb78c_ka49GuKQSx" target="_blank">Hebrews 7</a></p>
