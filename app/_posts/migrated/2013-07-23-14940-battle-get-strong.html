<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out our week looking at the spiritual battlefield. Focus on verse 10 today, and well soak in how much God is strengthening us in the fight.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:6-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 5:6-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God created all that exists. The enemy cant create, so he just looks to make chaos. God sent Jesus to walk through and conquer that chaos. God has restored his son to his place in heaven, and he is making a place for us there as well. All of the worry that you have cast onto God--he can remake into hope. The only way to be strong, firm, and steadfast is to plant all of your hope on the one who doesnt change--God.</p>
