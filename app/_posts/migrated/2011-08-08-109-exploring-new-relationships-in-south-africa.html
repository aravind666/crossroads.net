<p class="noPspace">When our partnership with Charity &amp; Faith Mission Church in Mamelodi came to an end in March, we decided that we are still absolutely committed to helping the people of South Africa. So we went into research mode: who are the best organizations in South Africa, churches or non-profits, who have a chance to change the game in that country?</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">To answer that question, we first reached out to all of our contacts in South Africa, from the U.S. Ambassador to various health and church associations. We also engaged a couple of South African consultants to help us sift through all of the information, and we facilitated multiple trips to SA by people from the Crossroads community to visit organizations that show promise. That work is still ongoing, but we definitely have some encouraging leads and a handful of organizations that have emerged as leaders in South Africa and potential partners for Crossroads.</p>

<p class="noPspace">One of the organizations that emerged is <a title="Grace Bible Church" href="http://www.gbcsoweto.org.za/" target="_blank">Grace Bible Church</a> (GBC). GBC is a 28-year old church that is about the same size as Crossroads, with multiple sites throughout South Africa. It is located in Soweto, a township outside of Johannesburg that is the epicenter of anti-apartheid resistance and modern black South Africa culture. Nelson Mandelas house sits just down the road.</p>

<p class="noPspace">GBC is very impressive and is surely a light for their community. Their senior pastor and founder, Mosa Sono, and his wife, Gege Sono, have become leaders in both Soweto and in all of South Africa. We have met multiple times and our churches really seem to click.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Mosa and Gege were scheduled to be in the U.S. this week for a conference in Chicago, so we are lucky to have them visit Crossroads this weekend, when Mosa will be speaking during our weekend services and telling stories of how the local church is making an impact in South Africa. This is not to be missed!</p>

<p class="noPspace">Obviously this begs the question: Is GBC our new partner? Right now, the answer to that question is "no." It is way too early to declare new partnerships. We are not in South Africa to make a short-term splash, but instead to make a long-term, game-changing impact. To do that, we must do our due diligence and be strategic in how we move forward. Further, cross-cultural work throughout the world, and especially in Africa, is very relational; It just takes time to truly get to know each other. That being said, GBC is making a real difference in South Africa and we would be foolish to not explore how our two organizations might work together in the future. That is what were doing now, and Grace Bible Church is along for the journey of figuring out this question together.</p>

<p class="noPspace">At the same time, we are still in research mode and talking to any organizations we find that are changing lives. The development of our South Africa initiative is still going to take some time, but organizations like GBC give us hope that there are real opportunities to make a difference.</p>
