<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to soften your heart or perspective toward a hard situation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A5-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">James 1:5-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When something bad happens its hard to see beyond our immediate circumstances. We get laser-focused on the problems at hand, and they consume all our thought and energy. Maybe we shut down. Maybe we get really selfish. Maybe we lash out at people around us. Maybe we turn away from God. But if we turn toward God, he freely gives us the wisdom to understand and grow through hardship.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Consider the wisdom God has for you. Instead of wallowing in your suffering, take five minutes and think about how you can learn or grow from your circumstance.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 6</a></p>
