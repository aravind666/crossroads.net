<p>Christmas Evangelism</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Ask God to direct your thoughts as you read the scripture from Isaiah below a few times, reflecting on how Jesus is described.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108949542799&amp;s=0&amp;e=001aajYdei-o3wRFliUBqfQZWjSVS9qP6q3HgPXm4UJpZxqYMaoYpXQPaDnVJe2h6h1rOTecxMCNN5AfsJwUAvq4VJEGvgQMSKz1ly1fwbLxzk3DAbY4SuJ1DYkvK2eTp5j32CtEXY7HrcTRBi-7vCJ5esmzUXGib4POerFtmxpHBr27tJig2Cwm27gdSZGHTy6co1_Qcb7b6r1ebSuign4zIAQn8HnFS71" target="_blank">Isaiah 9:6-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Somewhere  along the line, someone invited you to meet Jesus. Maybe that  invitation came from a friend, a group of people, an author, a parent.  Whoever it was, that person had received someone (Jesus) and then relayed their experience with Him to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inviting people into knowing Jesus is not about selling an idea. Its about a person--and a relationship. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If  you had to pick one characteristic of Jesus that draws you to him, what  would it be? Write down one way youve experienced that characteristic  (and hold onto it; well pick it back up tomorrow).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
