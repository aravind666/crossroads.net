<p>Doors</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Take some time and thank God for ways he has challenged you to grow.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>A  verse like this one from Revelation might either make us feel like an  incredible opportunity awaits--or it could put the pressure on. Jesus,  hand raised in mid-knock, hanging outside your door? Opening that door  could sound like a commitment youre not ready to make. Or maybe you  feel as if you open and shut the door thirty times a year. But reading  words from the Bible and talking to God is already opening the door (so  pressure is off, because we started todays Daily with it). And because  were human, were going to make decisions (or indecisions) that feel  like opening and closing the door all the time. We just walk away at  times. But it doesnt change Gods invitation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Try  to do this no matter where you are right now. Go sit or stand outside a  door: office, car, apartment. Then have a silent conversation with God,  even if that just means sharing your random thoughts with him. </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108902443893&amp;s=0&amp;e=001BE_Pv5lFtqXzkPGrZoI2-N8gzum6DZYdiwO676m_2hiS3nNkRdMtauYF0gHIvNQtkZXdUK4Wf4HXmW2pzhSBG0Dmej5-lQxD5_p8jQjW3PfjqFXw0k6qvmhWG4hq14sEc5TdiHa08yVd2MiypNYfMY7ZD0m0bQkVk24ZX-NhPyl2ABKuUVK3pDzHbo2qKyE_90u3UeU1YeMl4772ileQjQ==" target="_blank">Hebrews 6</a></p>
