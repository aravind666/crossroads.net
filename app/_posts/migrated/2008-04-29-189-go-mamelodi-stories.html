to partner with Charity and Faith Mission Church in bringing hope and
healing to Mamelodi. While there they built houses, planted gardens,
cared for kids and built relationships. <strong>And guess what... we're</strong> <a href="/gomamelodi">going back again this year</a>. <br><br>In
this series of podcasts, we'll be learning what happens when everyday,
normal Crossroads people make the decision to engage their world.<br><br><strong>Episode One: Jeff and Tiffany</strong><br><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/other-media/other-media/audio/Mamelodi-Jeff-Tiffany.mp3">Download</a> (right-click and Save-As)<br><br><strong>Episode Two: Nate and Jason</strong><br><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/other-media/other-media/audio/Mamelodi-Nate-Jason.mp3">Download</a> (right-click and Save-As)<br><br><strong>Episode Three: Derek Hunter</strong><br><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/other-media/other-media/audio/Mamelodi-Derek-Hunter.mp3">Download</a> (right-click and Save-As)<br><br><strong>Episode Four: Greg Rosenau</strong><br>
