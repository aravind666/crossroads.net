<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: You Choose</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to look this week at the influence of community on our ability to hear God and move.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2064:5-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalms 64:5-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Encouragement happens in community (no matter what kind of community it is). In what way are you being encouraged by your community now? Are you being encouraged to spur one another toward good deeds or like this verse suggests does your community in your work, school, or neighborhood influence you to gossip, be negative, or make poor choices? Does your community support you in good choices? Whether you are lacking in community right now or have bad community, you can choose to change that. If you have good community, you can affect how often you connect with them. You have the authority to decide how and who you engage in your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take an inventory of your community. List the people in your life, and then note if they are energizing (++), teachable/somewhat energizing (+), neutral (/), draining (-) or super draining (--). Next, journal about how this could affect how you spend your time.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%205&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 5</a></p>
