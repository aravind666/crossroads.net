Thanks to everyone who helped make the Thanksgiving Food Drive a smashing success. Here are just a few highlights&#58;<br /><ul><li>It didn't rain!</li><li>We met all our commitments to churches in Cincinnati, South Africa and New Orleans.</li><li>No one was hit by a car in the Annex lot or in Mason.</li><li>Tons of new givers and servers got engaged for the first time.</li><li>Every local TV station and the Enquirer picked up the story, and reporters were blown away by the fun everyone was having.</li><li>Even in these tough economic times, people gave 21% more food than last year.</li></ul>Amazing.<br />&nbsp;
