He wants to protect you, comfort you, shelter you and love you, just as a father would his child. <br> <br> As His child, you can reach out and ask for his help, just as you might have asked your dad for help with statistics homework, or for guidance about which job to take. When youre in pain, you can run to God like a child who fell off his bicycle. <br> <br> The type of father you know on earth can affect how you perceive God as a father. Even if your experiences with fathers are not all that positive, dont let that restrict your perception of how God wants to love and care for you.<br> <br><strong><br>RESPOND<br></strong>Nothing you do can separate you from Gods love. Knowing you are loved forever and unconditionally, how does that affect what you think about yourself and about God?<br> <br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK<br></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20John%203:1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 John 3:1-3<br><br><br></a></p></body></html>
