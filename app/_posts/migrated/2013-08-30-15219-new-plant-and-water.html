<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Plant and Water</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Well look at a passage in 1 Corinthians this week that talks about different kinds of workers in Gods mission. Today its planters and waterers.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:6-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So some context: Paul taught the Corinthians and then Apollos came and continued that teaching. There is some discussion among the people of the city about who they follow--Paul (the planter) or Apollos (the waterer). Paul makes it clear that he doesnt want anyone to follow him, but to follow God. Weve been talking about how God does new things. Sometimes God does new things through people, but he still gets the credit.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Journal today about ways that you might skimp on giving God credit, or how you give credit to planters or waterers, instead of God the grower.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4</a></p>
