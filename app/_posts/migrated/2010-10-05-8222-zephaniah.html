<p><strong>Tuesday, October 5</strong> <br>Zephaniah</p>
<p><br><em>Prayer: God, show me how you are mighty enough to rescue and save.</em></p>
<p><br><br><strong>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Zephaniah%202:3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Zephaniah 2:3</a></p>
<p><br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>Were called to do three things in this verse: seek God, seek humility and seek righteousness.</p>
<p>The ending is a little strange when it says, perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lords anger. Remember that God is continually calling us to be a part of his plan to tell the world about himand show the world his character through his people (us). We can only do that if we stay in a posture of listening and responding.</p>
<p>God knows our motives and someday we will stand before him and give an account of how weve lived (Romans 14:10-12). The best way to be ready for that day is to daily submit ourselves to His refinement.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong> <br>Read the Another Look verse below. Now take a moment to picture God as he is described in this verse. With this loving picture in mind, listen to God. He can speak to you. See what He has to say.</p>
