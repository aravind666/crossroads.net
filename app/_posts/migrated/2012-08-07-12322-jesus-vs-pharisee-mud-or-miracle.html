<p class="noPspace"><strong>Jesus vs. Pharisee: Mud or Miracle</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today, as we continue to look at Jesus healing the blind man, notice where people in the story are focusing. Jesus mud-making had broken the Sabbath laws. Some in the story are honing in on the miracle, and others are focusing on the mud.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209:14-26&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">John 9:14-26</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The Pharisees continue to put their questioning toward how Jesus performed the miracle. They wanted to prove his methods had broken the laws written by the Pharisees over thousands of years, laws written to parse out Gods way of living for the Israelites. The rule-writers had taken their focus off of God, though, and put it on the written laws. The fulfillment of Gods word was standing right in front of them doing signs and miracles and their eyes were literally in the mud.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Do you have some important rules that you live by? Write one down. It could be a family saying, or even a common phrase like God helps those who help themselves (for the record, that phrase isnt in the Bible). Now ask God to tell you what he believes.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 2</a></p>
