If you picked up an Angel Tree tag, <strong>please return your wrapped gift this weekend.</strong> Include the angel tag on the gift, and return it to the location where you picked up your tag. With over 4300 gifts committed to kids and caregivers, even a 99% return rate means we'll be scrambling to buy 43 gifts before delivery day. <strong>A family is depending on you. Please return your gift this weekend!</strong> Please <a href="/mysend/152" title="Email Angel Tree">contact us</a> with any questions.<font size="2"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"></font></font><!--EndFragment-->
