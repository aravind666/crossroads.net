<p>Under Your Feet</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2016:20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 16:20</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This past weekend, you might have taken a marker and written one of the lies youve believed on the bottom of your shoe. By now, the words are fading, and maybe youve sensed a growing peace as a result. This is what it feels like to experience Gods freedom. Peace. And this is Gods promise to all who trust him.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Thank God for the peace he offers to you through Jesus. If you arent feeling His peace, ask him to help you receive it right now.</p>
