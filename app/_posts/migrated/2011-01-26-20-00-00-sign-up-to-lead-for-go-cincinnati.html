<p>In 2010, 7000 of us from 50 churches got  dirty and sweaty, with paint-splattered hands and mulch-stained shirts,  at one of 400 projects. On Saturday, May 14, 2011, we’ll GO again. We  need leaders of all types for GO Cincinnati—construction experts, people  who love to throw parties, people who can entertain kids, and everyone  in between. <a title="GO Cincinnati Leader Sign Up" href="">Sign up now to lead for GO Cincinnati.</a></p>
