Dont they come from your desires that battle within you?You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures."<br><em>James 4:1-3<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001zOb3FRNNoUeiJhKMNBTi9q1On9TzhKJLm9LSiYPPiMWV_k5MAZ8BnwQY0BMwVERQZs9Cj49LkrQL7tYFCCK8ctj__t03mesLx4W266lVTYMRs1cungR3SuXuPBHPqCg1XFClPVf3z7wbAf5baLrRxcWZPAVA8rxY-lAoNyKvp2CoWr5QY6PYCA==" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>"You desire...so you kill." That sounds extreme, but theres brutal honesty in that statement (and anyone whos ever felt road rage knows what James is talking about). Think about any fights, quarrels or even minor disagreements youve had in recent memory. How many of them were fueled by your desire to be right, to get your own way, or to simply win?<br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Today, practice humility by finding one place where youre fighting to get your own way--and intentionally give in. Afterward, reflect on what God has to show you from that experience.<br><br><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong><br>Todays reading is:<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001zOb3FRNNoUeiJhKMNBTi9q1On9TzhKJLm9LSiYPPiMWV_k5MAZ8BnwQY0BMwVERQZs9Cj49LkrQL7tYFCCK8ctj__t03mesLlNpjtHeIT_DFEC0I4O2XA-lyHVyG3JTd28Dn3Zj6_coh96MdkzUKTprcLW-qJvmJ15UOQc_-YSs=" target="_blank">Acts 26</a><br><br></span></p>
