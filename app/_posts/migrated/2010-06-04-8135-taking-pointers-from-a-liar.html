<p>Taking Pointers From a Liar</p>
<p><br><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2016:1-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 16:1-9</a></p>
<p><br><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This is definitely not the kind of character study we generally see from Jesus. In this story, He tells about this lying little conniver, and just when we would expect him to give some principle about the need for honesty and integrity, he throws in a completely different twist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus says that our world would commend a guy like this. He was willing to bargain, willing to make use of the position and resources in front of him to make friends and create a favorable situation for himself. Rather than worrying or trying to hoard, he used what he had to make the best of a bad situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is that exact lesson that Jesus poses to usrather than worry or hoard, the resources in our control should be invested into others.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways can you use the resources you have to create favorable situations for God to work through you?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>God makes it clear throughout the Bible that everything we own is actually his. In shortwere all just renting. Spend a few minutes today asking God how you can invest the things hes given you into the lives of others.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2024&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 24</a> <br><br>______________________________<br><strong><br>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We talked this week about how parables are a picture of what Gods kingdom looks likethat they give real life examples of the life God wants for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>What picture or idea about Gods kingdom stood out to you this week? Why?</li>
<li>How is your impression of God different from what is depicted in these parables?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We also talked about how parables are sometimes complicated, and that they were called hard sayings for a reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>What about these stories challenges you to get out of your comfort zone in connecting with God?</li>
<li>What practical steps are you taking to meet that challenge?</li>
</ul>
