<p><strong>Friday, March 26</strong><br> Freedom Rings<br><br></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily focuses on an original song written for the Free journey by Andrea VonAllmen. Follow along with the lyrics while you listen to the song. Ask God to meet you during this time, and to speak to your heart about the freedom he has in store for you. </em><br><br><strong><br><strong>From Andrea:</strong><br></strong>Freedom isnt free and it must be fought for. Unfortunately, bombs and guns will not work in this fight. When we learn that an enemy is putting forth an aggressive effort to steal our freedom, we realize we must put forth an aggressive effort to claim it.<br><br><br><strong>Lyrics:</strong><strong><br></strong><em>Time goes by, I hear the lie that Im not worth love or fight</em><em><br><em>Truth and lie tangled up, waging war inside me</em><br><br><em>A war is raging thats hidden from my eyes</em><br><em>Not over power or money, I am the prize</em><br><em>Freedoms fee is not on me<br> So Im trading these chains for a new ID</em><em><br>Yeah, Im trading these chains for a new ID</em><br><br><em>Hopelessness, fear and doubt<br> Burdens I long to live without</em><br><em>If I could just trade them all</em><br><em>For what you give for freedom</em><br><br><em>Gloves off, armor on, truth is ammunition</em><br><em>Boots laced up tight, ringing in my ears tonight</em><br><em>Freedom rings in my ears tonight </em></em><br><br><br><strong>Listen:</strong><strong><br></strong><a href="/downloads/playMedia.php?idMedia=1028">Click here</a> to listen to Freedom Rings.</p>
