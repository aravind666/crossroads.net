<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Pursues Relationship</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man follows before he leads. This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about men who have been rewarded for remaining diligent, accountable, and connected to God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to increase your faith in him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Timothy 6:11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When money, power and sex become the things we chase, were not following God. Were actually doing the opposite. That doesnt mean its an easy fix when we decide to follow God. But when we decide to faithfully follow Him we start building a relationship. The more time and energy we put into following God, the more well reflect his character. Its about building a relationship, not having it all together.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, take 15 minutes and build your relationship with God. You can read the Bible, pray, journal or just sit quietly and listen. Whats God saying to you?</p>
