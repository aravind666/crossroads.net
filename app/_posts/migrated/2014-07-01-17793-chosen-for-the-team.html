<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Chosen for the Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were redefining the words happiness, wealth, family and love. All this week were receiving Gods love for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for choosing you for his team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.+1%3A4-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 1:4-6</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+3%3A18&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 3:18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Sometimes it feels like we never escape gym class, waiting to be chosen for team A or B. But when we receive Gods love, we dont have to wait. He chose us before we were even born. Before we were a twinkle in our mothers eye. Before we even made one mistake, He loved us. God knew us and he chose us to be part of his family. That is love.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write a love letter to a spouse, one of your kids, a dear friend or relative---consider what you love about them. Then, read the note back to yourself and know that God feels the exact same way about you.</p>
