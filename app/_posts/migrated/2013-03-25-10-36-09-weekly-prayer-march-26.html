<p class="noPspace"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this week&rsquo;s thoughts.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">I had a plan for this weekend&rsquo;s email but after going to the service last night and hearing from Andrea and Brian, I&rsquo;ve changed things up a bit. This email may be longer than it usually is but it is well worth the read. I&rsquo;m going to share two stories.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">First, Andrea mentioned her trip to South Africa from stage. <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uOiIM8BKSU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a link to a video of Andrea and Mae singing over an AIDS patient.</a></strong> This is one of the most loving and tender moments I have ever seen. Hopefully, it will play for you. It was my first upload to youtube ever.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>This is Rachel Peters&rsquo; report on the visit:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>On Wednesday four members of our team went to a community called Torani with Nelly, the professional nurse from Topsy. We met up with Tandee May, one of the Community Health Care workers that told us our first visit of the day would be to her very ill neighbor. We entered the house and were greeted warmly, and with a flood of tears. The patient&rsquo;s mother, daughter and aunt were all overcome with heavy emotions. Our team made our way to the bedside of a very frail patient. Tuberculosis and AIDS were winning. We held her hands and recited scripture. She mouthed the words back. We sang songs, and the heaviness in the room dissolved. We looked in her eyes and told her she was beautiful. She slowly blinked and received the love.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>On Friday, Tandee May joyfully reported to our team that her neighbor died Wednesday, a few hours after our visit. With her hope firmly anchored in what we cannot see, Tandee May said, "you got to open the door to heaven". What an honor.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Once you recover from that story, here&rsquo;s another that came in a letter this week. It is seemingly unrelated but I&rsquo;ll tie them together afterwards:</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Dear Crossroads, I am enclosing a check for $40.00. It&rsquo;s not much but it is 10% of my current weekly unemployment compensation before taxes; so, I believe it fulfills the definition of tithe--and my novice attempt at financial investment for spiritual growth.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I have been out of work since September 2012 and my unemployment compensation is running out. I am my own sole support and, as yet, have been unsuccessful in securing another position. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of near misses but those made everything feel worse somehow. When I came to church today, I was teetering on the precipice of that black hole where petrified, panicked, desperate, and hopelessness lurk. When I heard the topic, I cringed. Money? That&rsquo;s the whole problem. I have none and no prospects on the horizon. I was actually tempted to leave, something that has never before crossed my mind, but I stayed.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Long story short, I cried silent tears all through the service. Afterward, I sat alone and waited for someone to come and pray with me. It took a few minutes but, in my current state of mind, it felt like ten forevers. In those few moments, I felt the terrible heartbreak of total abandonment and isolation--that terrible human frailty called fear manifesting in the seemingly real possibility that God wasn&rsquo;t there, that he was coming for me. Devastating.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>When I saw my prayer partner hurrying toward me, I lost whatever composure I&rsquo;d managed to hold on to up to that point. I wept openly and my need for prayer spilled out. And she prayed with me so beautifully. I knew the Holy Spirit was there because panic was displaced with calm. Such a relief. That feeling of peace remains with me as I write this.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>So, today&rsquo;s takeaway was huge. I have been operating at a devastating and debilitating deficit in every area: financially, intellectually, physically, relationally, and spiritually with all of the above converging causing me to actually entertain the thought that God had deserted me. Wow. Talk about your downward spiral. So please accept this $40.00 donation that I give gleefully. It&rsquo;s the first of what I hope will be a variety of investments I&rsquo;m about to make in order to receive a much higher yield. I&rsquo;m still unemployed, my benefits are still running out, but my flagging faith has been restored and I feel the seeds of hope germinating in my heart.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Dag! Two unbelievable stories in one week. Both are stories of people who are in sustenance mode but are finding freedom and comfort through investing, and through the investment of others, in the spiritual and relational capitals. Beyond that, this lady&rsquo;s $40 gift partially enabled the woman in South Africa to be loved on in her time of need.</p>
<p class="noPspace">While you&rsquo;re enjoying your week of beans and rice, remember to pray for people who are living in a season of sustenance. Pray for peace and love and grace and provision to rain down on these people. Pray for all of us to have the courage to invest what we have in the spiritual capital and pray for it to yield an abundance of hope.</p>
