<p>Righteous Lips Build Ships</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please fill me with righteousness and may you use my words to nourish.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Has  anyone ever paid you one of those "soul-reviving" compliments? The kind  thats way more than just "great job" or "nice shirt," but one that  speaks directly into your heart? Maybe it was something simple like,  "you are so smart," having no idea that your entire childhood you were  told, "youre an idiot." And you end up with a lump in your throat,  thinking, "That guy just read my mail."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  that moment, God was using someones words to nourish your spirit. The  Bible tells us "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word  that comes from the mouth of God." Those nourishing, spirit-feeding  words of God are often spoken through others around us. The question is:  will we swallow them, or will we "politely" refuse?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Today  practice telling those around you what you think of them...the good  stuff, that is. And when people tell you good things about yourself,  practice saying "thank you" with both your tongue and your heart.</p>
