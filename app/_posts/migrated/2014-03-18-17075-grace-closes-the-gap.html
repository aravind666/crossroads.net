<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to be present with you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A21&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Romans 5:21</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">John 17:1-3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our world was once a place ruled by sin. We were separated from God. And even though it still sometimes feels this way, God is good and his grace rules. When He sent Jesus to rescue us, everything changed. Once apart from God, Jesus closed the gap so we could have an intimate, close relationship with him. So we could know Him. This is how we receive eternal life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants to know you. If He were sitting right next to you, what would you say to him? Dont worry about preparing a speech, just tell God whats on your heart and mind. Hes listening.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 2</a></p>
