<img src="../images/uploadedImages/ConsumedBanner.jpg" alt="Consumed journey banner" title="Consumed banner" width="441" height="67" /><br /><br />I used to be a materialistic brat. I always had the latest and greatest fashions, and I loved the way people responded positively to how I looked. I grew up getting material rewards that my parents told me I &ldquo;deserved.&rdquo;<br /><br />God took me on the Consumed journey to address the issues that ultimately changed my life: Buying things doesn&rsquo;t bring me happiness. I don&rsquo;t need stuff to have friendships or to have a sense of self worth. Racking up a tab at J.Crew and Banana Republic was a feeble attempt at filling an emotional vacancy. <br /><br />I&rsquo;m not debt-free by any means, but I am free of the emotional baggage and bondage that held me for so long. I have a sense of peace that comes from understanding I was created with a sense of purpose. Doing things&mdash;like building homes with GO New Orleans&mdash;are more important than buying <br />things. I have a sense of contentment I had never had from continually buying things. <br /><br />Unraveling 29 years of materialism is not easy, but I&rsquo;m on a path toward debt reduction. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; when Banana has a sale, I do struggle. But I realize know that I want to store my treasures in heaven, not in my closet.<br />
