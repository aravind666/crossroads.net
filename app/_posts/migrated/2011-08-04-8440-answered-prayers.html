<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Moses  is nearing the end of his life. He knows that, because he has disobeyed  God, he wont be entering the Promised Land. But rather than argue with  God, or sit in bitterness, Moses heart is for the Israelites. He  advocates for them, asking God to send them someone to replace him. Not  just a leader to give direction, but also a shepherd who will care for  them. Gods answer is immediate: "Take Joshua."</p>
<p></p>
<p>How  encouraging to see Moses leave on such a selfless high note. How  awesome to see God honor Moses so instantly. And how humbling to be  Joshua-the answer to a prayer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Can  you imagine yourself as the answer to someones prayer? Perhaps youve  actually been told that you were. Of all the people on the planet, God  picked you to be a vessel for him in that persons life. Today ask God  to use you in someone elses life. And thank Him for the opportunity.</p>
