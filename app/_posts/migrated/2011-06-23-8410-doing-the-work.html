<p>Doing the Work</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to see the meaning you put into work.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:23&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 14:23</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God doesnt call us to just think about or talk about work. He calls us to, yknow, actually work at work. Sometimes the work can seem overwhelming, but we must remember that if God has called us to it, then he will get us there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This verse is pretty clear: Just talk can lead to poverty. And there are many types of povertyemotional, spiritual, relational, the list goes on... The other side is this: God will bless our hard work, period.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this community, weve learned hard work leads to amazing things. When we work as a church, cities are changed. When we work as individuals, lives are changed. So dont give up if work gets hard. Stay focused! Remember: doing something is always more challenging than thinking about doing something.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend a few minutes reflecting on the fact that work is hard, but that God promises all hard work will be rewarded. Ask Him to give you endurance to overcome hard work, and the eyes to see the reward.</p>
<p></p>
