<strong>The shuttle bus will not be running on Sunday</strong>, so those planning to park in the Circuit City lot and ride over to the building will...be...walking. Plan accordingly if you have small children (or are dressing to look cool instead of for the weather.)<br /><br />The shuttle bus company said they couldn't drive in the weather. They'll be back next weekend.
