<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New Territory: Labor</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will look at five consecutive verses in Isaiah 54. Today, put your focus on verse 1, but well keep the full passage intact for context.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 54:1-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God always spoke to his people, the Israelites, as if they were a wife or lover in the Old Testament. Then, in the New Testament, the church is called the bride of Christ. So, no matter your gender--step into being the woman in this passage. Wherever you have turned up feeling infertile, like nothing can be birthed, like no new territory can be taken, God sees new things there. Maybe what you feel isnt the pain of barrenness, but the pain of labor.</p>
