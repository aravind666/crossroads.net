<p>Protect or Submit</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: God I want to trust your mission alone. Amen.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%2018:4-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 18:4-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus says in this passage, I am he. In the Greek, this could also be translated as an emphatic, I am. This is a statement of Jesus divine nature. I am connects with how God describes himself to Moses in the Old Testament. Here, Jesus is saying I am the I am, the God of your forefathers, the living God (as Peter confessed earlier).</p>
<p></p>
<p>But what is Peters response this time? Peter believes, but his response is off mission. Jesus bold statement of godliness also means submitting to a larger plan that will save all of mankind. Its a plan He had been conveying to his disciples. Peter believes Jesus is more than human, but he responds like one who cant let go of who Jesus is to him. He leaps to protect, not to submit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus is not only a savior to each of us, he is God over all. Do you only think of Him as who he is to you, or do you submit to his larger story? Peter leapt too soon to protect, because he adored Jesus, but this is not the same as trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do you place yourself at the center of the story, or give that position to God? Is there a place in your life right now where you feel frustrated with someone or with God? Ask God to reveal his larger story.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>Peter has amazing moments of trust in Jesus. God revels in our trusting of him. He is a good father who loves the intimacy of a relationship that comes with trust. Whether we get off target like Peter occasionally does, or leap out of the boat, walking in trust of Gods bigger plan brings a larger freedom.</p>

<li>What could you do to foster or grow trust in Jesus?</li>
<li>How could your community support you or remind you to trust?</li>
<li>What could your life look like if you lived in a state of trust instead of fear or religion?</li>
</ul>
