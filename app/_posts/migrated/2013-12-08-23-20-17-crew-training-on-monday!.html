<p class=\"noPspace\">Hi all,</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Just a reminder that Stage Crew training is tomorrow, <strong>Monday, Dec. 9th from 7&#58;00-9&#58;00 pm</strong> at Crossroads Oakley. Please park by and enter through the back stage door (located on the southwest corner of the building). There’s a sign on the door that reads, \"Awaited Rehearsals\". Please enter the auditorium quietly (band rehearsal will be in progress) and walk across the atrium to the Student Section (formerly known as CSM). Your volunteer Awaited code - <strong>135800</strong> - will get you into both the auditorium and CSM throughout the Awaited run.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">We will meet in the CSM game room at 7&#58;00 for a brief team meeting and then you be turned over to your Crew leader for training.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Crew Chief and Backstage Lead&#58;</strong> Cassy Booker</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Costume Lead&#58;</strong> Katrina Palmer</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Catwalk Lead&#58;</strong> Brian Thomas (Brian, you will walk your team over to the auditorium to meet the staff catwalk guys)</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Make up & hair volunteers as well as Camel assists do <strong>NOT</strong> need to attend this training.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Thanks all!</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">See you tomorrow,</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Paula</p>
