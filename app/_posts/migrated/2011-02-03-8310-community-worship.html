<p>Community Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway ephesians 5:18-20" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%205:18-20&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 5:18-20</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever spent time telling God what you think about him in the midst of your friends? Worshipping together as a community is a powerful way to connect with God in the presence of your community. So what if no one can carry a tune? Worship doesnt have to look like Kumbyah around a campfire (though it can). It could look like giving praise to God out loud with your friends, or reading through some of the Bibles psalms of praise together while you reflect on the all the ways God has blessed you and your friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whatever it looks like, worshipping together as a community is another way to grow closer to God while spending time with your friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask around. Surely somebody strummed a guitar once or twice in college. If not, no sweat. Grab a laptop and put some music on that celebrates God and what hes done in the lives of your friends, and worship together. Shout aloud together all the good things 2010 has held for each of you, and worship Him in community for his grace and mercy over the last year. It doesnt have to look a certain way, just do it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway mark 14" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2014&amp;version=NIV">Mark 14</a></p>
