<p>A Birth of Promise and Threat</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>What do you do with what you believe?</p>
<p></p>
<p>God the Father chose a most unusual way to come and rescue his children. He came as a childbut not a typical child. Rather, a child who was conceived of himself though his Spirit, so that he was fully God and fully man. And also a public disgrace. Joseph, despite these threatening and countercultural circumstances, listened to God and chose courageously to do what God commanded: he rescued Mary from disgrace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>RESPOND  Ask God to do what is needed to love others sacrificially, despite any threats to yourself.</p>
<p></p>
