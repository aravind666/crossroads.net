<p>First things First</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me get rid of the stuff that hinders my faith.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107008383421&amp;s=0&amp;e=001CsqZALRNQN_Do6LcyCd1SFIE_6FAGrT2yLbx6k409G9ie1unTlPkRj7higDfr0mu1NIBmFvhfDPKNTJL7ufpYLRP4xlVSdaL60zPZbgC59hrYGKvA94oV9dbXLCS9oAIVfOoMN7agpfIiHq6zJ8LpQeGvFPChYXJzv0jjZLycptZfNAhnrNpqOBzx0Aej8LwEIR7hR7o08oEaF6_SM2MyH8r_XXipb0V" target="_blank">Joshua 3:5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Joshua  was about to lead the Israelites across the Jordan River. Skipping  ahead in the story, we know that God performs a miracle, by holding back  the flow of the Jordan River at flood stage. But the dry river bed  would not appear until the priests carrying the ark of the covenant  stepped into the water. Literally, they would have to step out in faith.  Pretty amazing!</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  this verse, we see the importance of first things first. Unconfessed  sin, fear or other spiritual muck can hinder our faith. The day before  the miracle, Joshua instructed the Israelites to be sure their hearts  are pure andthat they are devoted to God, because they could not afford  to have anything jeopardize their faith.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>God  wants to do amazing things in your life. Take some time to ask God  about any muck in your heart that hinders faith. Maybe you have fear, or  maybe a sin or secret no one knows about. Call someone and confess to  them - consecrate yourself. And watch God show up.</p>
