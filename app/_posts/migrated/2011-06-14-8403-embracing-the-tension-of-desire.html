<p>Embracing the tension of desire</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%206:7-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 6:7-9</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong> <br>This passages use of food and hunger is an apt metaphor: despite all that God provides for us, we can easily be consumed with desires. Beyond the obvious deadly-sin type desires like lust or greed, there are other desires that may take over our lives without our being fully aware of their power. Consider the drive that sends a person into the office on a weekend, or causes someone to forego a family occasion so he or she can get in an extra workout at the gym. We may feel that were bettering our lives, but in reality were being pulled in the wrong direction by desire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem with desires - even ones that improve our health or financial standing - is that they can distract us from Gods ultimate purpose in our lives. We may even feel that were moving in the direction God wants us to go, when in reality were using His will as an excuse to chase a desire. Its hard to let go of our passions, but without balance in our lives, it can be difficult to follow the paths God has planned for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Look at your calendar: how balanced is it? If you had complete control over your schedule, would you change it from how it is now? What changes would you make? Are there changes you can make to balance your work, social, family and spiritual commitments in an even manner?</p>
