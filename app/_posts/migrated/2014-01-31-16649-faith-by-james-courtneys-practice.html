<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I recently realized that I have a gift of connecting people. Well, to be honest, I didnt really realize that until someone told me, so I started to pay attention to it more. I consider it an honor, but I also see how in some ways I can be prideful, as if I am responsible for such wonderful connections. Wrong! Actually, a lot of the time it was unintentional and I just happened to invite different groups of friends to things and they would develop relationships out of that first meeting and that was cool to see.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So, I thought instead of just letting that happen, what would it be like to intentionally use that gift to bless others---to really be attentive and more strategic about listening to the needs of my friends so that I could really sharpen my gift?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">That has led me to a lot of unexpected joy and excitement. I have become more present in the midst of conversations and I have been able to share the goodness of folks I love with others. Ultimately, its not about me at all because God does not have to use me. He doesnt need me to connect anyone to anybody. But I want to be a good steward of my gift. I get to sit back and watch Him write exciting stories for folks and give him the credit and glory. I like that Im a vessel, but I love that Hes the author.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">James says that anyone who knows the good they ought to do and doesnt do it, well, thats plain wrong. Identify what that is and go do the good youre not doing.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 4</a></p>
