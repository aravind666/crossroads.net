<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Builds Endurance</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man follows before he leads. This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about men who have been rewarded for remaining diligent, accountable, and connected to God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you reach the finish line.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+1%3A3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have you ever thought about how to achieve a goal? If your goal is to write a bestselling book, you have to write a lot. If you want to run a marathon, you have to run a lot. We have to build endurance for the things we want to achieve. The same goes for our faith. The more time we spend listening to God the more we will hear from him in every area of our lives and the path for achieving our goals will be more clear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What goals are you working towards? Pick one of them and ask God for a clear direction. Whatever He brings to mind---giving up control, talking to someone, or something that might sound a little scary---go and do it.</p>
