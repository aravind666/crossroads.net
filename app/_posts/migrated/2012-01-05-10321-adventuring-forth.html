<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Spend three or so minutes in silence. Be open to hearing from God and just enjoying the focused time with him.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"...Life cannot be understood flat on a page. It has to be lived; a person has to get out of his head, has to fall in love, has to memorize poems, has to jump off bridges into rivers...We get one story, you and I, and one story alone. God has established the elements, the setting and the climax and resolution. It would be a crime not to venture out, wouldnt it?"</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">In yesterdays Daily, we considered our dream/s for 2012. Make one move toward that dream today. It could be as simple as making a list, taking a brainstorm walk, letting someone else in on your dream or collecting some dream supplies. Make one, single move. Record it.</p>
