Each year, Crossroads donates food to needy families in Cincinnati and
South Africa during the Thanksgiving season. In 2007, people like you
helped to provide more than <strong>180,000 meals.</strong> You can help make the <strong>2008 Thanksgiving Food Drive</strong> happen by serving as a shopping buddy, or as a volunteer for pick-up or drop-off.
