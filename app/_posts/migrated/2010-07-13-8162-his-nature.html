<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When people hear the word Christian or God, the first feelings they have might not be pleasant ones. Judgmental, withdrawn or controlling are more likely to come before loving, generous or nurturingespecially when people arent familiar with Gods true character and the transformed character of those who follow him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Praying that Gods name is hallowed is to pray that his nature is known not only to those who believe in him, but also to those who dont. And the way God chooses to show his nature to the world is through the scripture and through us. Because of His Spirit, the nature of his followers becomes more and more transformed to mirror his.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In what ways has Gods nature overflowed into your life?</p>
