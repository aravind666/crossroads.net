<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Protects Physically</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to explore what the Bible says about men. This week, well focus on how the New Man is a protector.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you how to physically protect others.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A25-33&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5:25-33</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The most recognizable picture we have of a man includes brute strength. We see it in images of the military, sports leagues, and our local police and firemen. Say what you want about these pictures, but theyre not all wrong---being a man does include and require physical strength especially when it comes to protecting others. In Ephesians, Paul writes that men should treat and protect their wives as they would their own bodies. In the same way he would defend himself against harm, the New Man protects and defends his wife and those around him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How can you physically protect your loved ones? That could mean spending more time with free weights or deciding to be gentler with them. Whatever that looks like for you, do it today.</p>
