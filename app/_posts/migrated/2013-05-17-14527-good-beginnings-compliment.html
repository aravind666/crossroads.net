<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good Beginnings: Compliment</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look this week at Gods original creation of man and woman, as we look at the next verse in Genesis 2.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:21-22&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:23</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">These are the first recorded words of mankind. Not a bad way to start a relationship. Adam celebrates and names Eve. Being that Eve was taken from Adam and that he named her, there is a sense within this relationship that he is the head, with a special authority. But, if Adam was created last as the best of creation, and Eve followed, there is a sense that if he is the head, she is the crown of creation. God created two treasured beings who were designed to function in Gods blessing of fruitfulness, but only together. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Even though she was created within the same day, Adams first words about Eve were at last! Yesterday, we looked at what God has to say about your gender. Today, write down the opposite of your gender, and ask God to speak to you about how he views (and wants you to view) your compliment. Write about it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2027&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 27</a></p>
