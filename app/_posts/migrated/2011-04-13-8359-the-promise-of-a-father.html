<p>The Promise of a Father</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me let go of the control that belongs to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2017:%201-8&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 17:1-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So God appears to Abram (now Abraham), and put simply, says he will bless the whole world through him. It sounds like a great deal, right? But theres one snag: Abraham is 99 years old. Not the ideal time to start a family. And when it came to kids, Abraham and Sarah had given up. </p>
<p></p>
<p>God often asks us to trust him in the exact places where it seems hes not answered us in the past. Chances are pretty good that Abraham and Sarah had asked for a child in the previous decadesand now, at 99, God gives the answer that feels like a direct response.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What happens in the space between our request to God and a revealed answer? This is the time for growing faith in a Father who has built every answer before our questions were even asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of a time in your life (or in someone elses life) where Gods answer came in a really unexpected way, or maybe seemed a long time coming. Use that experience as a way to strengthen your own faith as you wait on Gods promises today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
