<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God created us to keep in step with this rhythmic world he created. This week we continue to look at the ways the Bible mentions practices that should repeat daily.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208:34&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proverbs 8:34</span><br><br></a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There are a lot of influences in the world that want to change the radio frequency on the dial of our soul. If we take a moment to tune our spiritual ears to the frequency of Gods Spirit, we are like the messengers of Biblical times who waited by the door to hear the kings decrees. We can be the first to know what God is up to when we posture ourselves daily to hear him. We also are way less likely to end up several steps into our day (or life) totally off course.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Picture yourself right outside your Dads (Gods) study. If you were just a kid drawing pictures on the floor and the door was ajar, what might you overhear?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 7</a></span></p>
