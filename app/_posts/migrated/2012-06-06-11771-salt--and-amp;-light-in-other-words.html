<p class="noPspace"><strong>Salt &amp; Light: In Other Words</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were unpacking Jesus descriptions of his followers as salt and light.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>"Let me tell you why you are here. Youre here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? Youve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage. Heres another way to put it: Youre here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. Were going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you dont think Im going to hide you under a bucket, do you? Im putting you on a light stand. Now that Ive put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand--shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, youll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven."</p>
