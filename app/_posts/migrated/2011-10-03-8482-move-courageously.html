<p>Move Courageously</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to give you courage today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107940442599&amp;s=0&amp;e=001OuPPAmoxNZHrDwghy6bSfZBbk-CsrCH_aj-J7H9gWd3ufri7BYa2MPMktxBcDpNRhBYD5lL7c9nNtjw9NBN7Z8ILMM1x1wHMjDQePE8BKIdV3UtgN4fdsXL7OEyvRx-XbSXhUpnn-pGEI01Ng2raZYVK-_bskr6UfsTI49VoD9r2ZU_j1G7_sL8NpJx_sutDCFSpr8HBFveV6w1lF-f4Dg==" target="_blank">Daniel 6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Make  no mistake about it: Daniel knew exactly what was going down. You dont  spend a lifetime in politics without learning who your enemies are and  what everyone is planning. When Daniel saw this law, he knew it was  geared at one person. Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And  he had a choice to make. He very easily could have stopped praying, or  hidden it away, or even simply changed his daily routine. After all, he  was so predictable that even his enemies knew what time of day they  could catch him in the act. Yet he didnt. He moved forward into a  choice that could have cost him his life, trusting that God would be  with him, regardless.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Often  it isnt the big moments where we lose our courage. It is the small  ones--the temptation to cut short a prayer, to join in on a joke, to  listen to the latest gossip. Take a few minutes and ask God to show you  one small area where he wants you to be courageous and stand for him  today.</p>
