<p>In the Minority</p>
<p></p>
<p>God, speak your direction for my life clearly, and build my faith in you.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Joshua  and Caleb, among others, had been selected to scope out the land of  Canaan. This was the Promised Land for the Israelites who had been  wondering in the desert for forty years. The men returned with good news  (the land flowed with milk and honey), and bad news (lots of giant,  scary people already live there). The people were angry and terrified,  convinced defeating the Canaanites would be impossible. Even at the risk  of death, Joshua spoke up. With everything he had, he sought to  convince the Israelites of what he believed was Gods will. He spoke  encouragement and faith, despite the fact that he was in the minority.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeking  Gods will does not guarantee that we will be in the majority. And  speaking out about what we believe is Gods will doesnt guarantee us  warm fuzzies from those around us. But we cant let that stop us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  a time when you were faced with the decision to either speak up at the  risk of ridicule, or follow the majority knowing they were wrong. What  did you do? Why? How did you feel after? Where was God in the midst of  the decision?</p>
