<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Big Vision Culture: Holy Fear</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, we do a flyby look at the very complicated story of Noah. #floodsareforsuckers</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its hard to wrap up the story of Noah in a 15 minute look, but Noah was one of our faith fathers. When rain had never happened on the earth--he built a boat. Noah had favor with God. God could have told everyone to build a boat (I dont know, he might have), but hearing from God does not equal faith. Noah acted. Building the boat is an act of holy fear. It makes the statement--I fear and value Gods opinion of me more than any humans assessment.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Be about faith-doing today instead of faith-believing. Is there an act of faith that you could be about today that might even bring about holy fear? Walk into it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 11</a></p>
