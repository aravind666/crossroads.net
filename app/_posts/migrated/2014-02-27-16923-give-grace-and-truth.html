<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Give Grace &amp; Truth</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, weve explored how Jesus teaches us to give grace and truth to each other in the midst of hard situations.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to share his grace and truth with someone in your circles of influence.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">John 1:14</a>,<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A27-32&amp;version=CEB&amp;interface=print"> Luke 5:27-32</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus didnt come to save the people who thought they had it all figured out. Lucky for us, He came for the people who made mistakes. While everyone else treated Matthew (also known as Levi) like an outsider, Jesus did not. He gave him grace, showed him love and compassion. For the longest time he played the role people had put him in, but Jesus invited him out of that life to follow him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are all invited to follow Jesus no matter what our occupation, status or how broken we might be. And to live a life that looks like Jesus (who came full of grace and truth, for those of you still reading) weve got to give each other grace and, when the time calls for it, the truth.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of someone who is considered an outsider---you might even have a personal relationship with him or her. Spend some time and think about how you can give that person grace.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print"> 2 Corinthians 8</a></p>
