<p>Out of the Spotlight</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to focus more on you. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%208:5-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:5-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Introvert or extrovert, what makes us prone to self-dramatization? What keeps us awake at night, worrying about potential disasters, fretting that God wont provide?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes we cant get our minds off ourselves and our own dilemmas. But living in the spotlight (especially when were the ones shining it) brings immense pressure. When were bound up in our own drama, we arent drawing near to God. We arent allowing His peace to quiet us, to heal us, to teach us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its not easy stepping away from our internal spotlights, but bringing God into the center is what brings us into the peace he offers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If you feel bound up in your own drama, ask God to reveal to you why youre getting trapped or what you might imagine is the reward for self-dramatization. Then ask God to begin showing you how peace is the bigger reward.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a time when you felt peace about something, big or small. (It could be the thing you wrote about on Monday.)</li>
<li>Often, we feel inner turmoil when we hold something inside. Airing your anxieties with others you trust in your community can bring good outside perspective and accountability. Its also a good time to get prayer. So share one thing with your group that youre worrying about or struggling through. Then take turns praying for each person. </li>
</ul>
