<p>A Different Way of Life</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2011:32-40&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:32-40</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So maybe being faithful isnt quite how its generally imagined. In fact, its not really all that religious sounding. So what is it to be faithful? Its trusting what you cant see.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its being willing to wait for whats promised.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its knowing that what seems odd in the moment may just work after all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its understanding that the choices of the past dont keep us (or others) from being faithful now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the end, its realizing that life looks altogether different when we believe that God can be trusted to keep his promises</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you generally think of when you picture a faithful life?</li>
<li>Why do you think that living this way is such a challenge for us?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a minute to read back through todays passage again. While we dont like to hear it, the writer makes it pretty clear that a faithful life doesnt at all mean an easy or comfortable life. Ask God to help you learn to remain faithful, even in times of suffering.</p>
