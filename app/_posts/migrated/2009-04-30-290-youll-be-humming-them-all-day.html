Hey parents...you know how you spend much of your "driving around" time trying to numb yourself out because you just listened to "The Wheels On The Bus" for the 700th time in two days? Well... <strong>Kids' Club</strong> has just released a new collection of music that's sure to make those road trips a lot more enjoyable. It's really great and you can download it for free <a href="/kidsclub/music.htm">HERE</a>. </body></html>
