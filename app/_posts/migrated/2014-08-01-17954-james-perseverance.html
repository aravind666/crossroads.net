<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Perseverance</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Last week, we read the entire book of James. This week, were focusing on one passage and going phrase by phrase.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 1:2-4</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">James was well aware of the human desire to say, God, make this [struggle] go away. Even Jesus, before he was crucified, asked for his suffering to end. But instead of focusing on the endpoint, James encourages us to let perseverance finish its work--to let the refining happen--by instead saying, God, what are you helping me to become through this?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend some time asking God what hes helping you become.</p>
