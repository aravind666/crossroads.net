<p>When We Obey</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>God, please help me to clearly hear the wisdom you have for my life today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2048:17-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 48:17-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Peace comes when we obey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When were following Jesus and responding to what hes speaking into our life (obedience), we strengthen our relationship with him. Even when obedience is hard, we can trust that Gods guidance will bring us freedom. We will have peace, as Isaiah says, like a river.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A story of peace:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was in deephaving an affair, and felt so much shame that I went from panic attacks to becoming numb. One night I was out with a friend who was brave enough to tell me I had to stop what I was doing. As my friend was talking, I knew I had to tell my spouse what was going on. I also knew God was going to honor that choice, which was a feeling that came out of left field. Ill be honest, the next years were really hard. I felt unworthy for any second chances. Yet, somehow God put hope in me. I hadnt felt that kind of peace in my entire life. I knew that my courage to tell my spouse came totally from God. The courage I felt going into the situationthat, too, was from God. It couldnt have come from anywhere else.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God where he wants to bring peace into your life. Maybe its in regards to the thing you wrote last week, or maybe its in an entirely new place. Write it down.</p>
