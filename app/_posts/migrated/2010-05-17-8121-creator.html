<p><strong>Week 1: Characteristics of God</strong></p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong> <strong>Monday, May 17</strong></p>
<p>Creator<strong><br></strong><br> Over the next two weeks, well be looking at specific characteristics of God. Well look at who He is, what he does and how that affects the way we relate to him.</p>
<p><em><br> Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.<br></em><br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ<br></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%201:26-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 1:26-31</a><br> <br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT </strong><br> God is our Creator. He made this world and everything in itthe land, the sea, the sky and all living creatures. Then He saved his best work for last: he created man and woman in his likeness, and said that his creations were good.<br> <br> Youre a part of Gods creation. And just as He gave fish fins so they could swim, he made you in his image so that you could be in relationship with Him. Relating to God should be as natural to us as breathing, because its a part of who we are. Do you find it easy to talk to God? Why or why not?<br> <br><strong><br>RESPOND<br></strong>God created you in his image, but do you know what his image looks like? Write down some characteristics of who you believe God is. Then look over your answers as you spend the next two weeks examining aspects of Gods character.<br> <br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK<br></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%2017:%2024-28&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 17: 24-28<br></a><br></p>
