<p class="noPspace">Hello, family and friends! We wish you could be here experiencing this rich culture with us, but know that you are not far from our hearts.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We are a little slow at reacting, but the six of us are finally on line and all of us are also jet lagged.&nbsp; We arrived at the airport/hotel late last night, 1:00 am.&nbsp; The hotel is great and we were all in bed by 2:30 am, and up again at 7 am for a wonderful day exploring the city.&nbsp; We saw the Gateway to India, walked the city, and shopped at Colaba.&nbsp; Everyone purchased gifts for family and friends.&nbsp; Reaching the restaurant for lunch was an unexpected challenge, but we had an awesome meal when we finally arrived after at least 4 u turns and 3 driveways.&nbsp; We had the entire staff in India supporting Crossroads with us all day and they are tired but in great spirits (also Shannon from IJM joined us).&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t experience rain until we returned to the hotel. We waited in traffic for 10 minutes only to realize we were steps from our hotel as the driveway was blocked!&nbsp; An adventure for all of us.&nbsp; We are working late this evening to prepare for the Conferences we will be attending over the next two days. More to come!</p>
