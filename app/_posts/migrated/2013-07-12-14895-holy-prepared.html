<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Holy: Prepared</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we look at Romans 8:29-30, again. Dont skip reading it, though. We are letting God make us more holy this week, and reading Gods words and letting them sink in is a good start.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:29-30&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:29-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Suffering, who needs it? Even Jesus, who knew the big picture of dying on the cross, asked God three times to let this burden pass over him. If we are to be formed into the very image of Jesus (like The Daily talked about yesterday), we must know that everything that falls outside of that image will need to be trimmed away. Pruning is never comfortable, but seeing it as preparation to be received into Gods holiness gives vision and purpose to our suffering. Suffering well means letting suffering do the full work of training and refining us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Look at one area of your life that feels uncomfortable or even painful right now and ask God how he wants to create more of his image in you through that situation?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 1:15-16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16</a></p>
