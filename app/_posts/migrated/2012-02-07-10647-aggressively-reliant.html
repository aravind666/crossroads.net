<p class="noPspace"><strong>Aggressively Reliant</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2017:45-50&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 17:45-50</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Among all the armies of Israel, only David was willing to face Goliath. He didnt believe he could beat Goliath on his own; he couldnt just man up. But David was unwilling to give up. Instead, he stepped up his faith in God and moved boldly toward the giant, confident not in his own abilities but in the power of the God he served. Like David, underdogs win when they move forward in aggressive faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Regardless of the Goliath youre facing, dont man up or give up. Instead, step up your reliance on God (or your pursuit of God if youre unsure about him), and run hard with aggressive faith. That might look like any (or all) of the following:</p>
<li>Get honest with someone about your struggle for the first time</li>
<li>Turn to God in prayer and ask for his help or direction</li>
<li>Do the hard thing you already know is the right thing</li>

<p class="noPspace">Remember, God responds when we choose to rely on him.</p>
