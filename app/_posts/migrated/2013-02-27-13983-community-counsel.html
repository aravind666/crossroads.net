<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Counsel</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Weve looked this week at being intentional in choosing community, listening and encouraging. Today, we look at one place in our journey between listening and doing that you must include other people.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2015:22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 15:22</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">No matter where we are (with people or alone) when we feel nudged by God to move, the next step is to bring good community into that movement. When we sense Gods nudge, there is room to get off target in how we execute on what we hear. A few good friends can help you find where your own desires or pride are causing your response to God to be off by a degree or two. If you leave from your hometown across country to another city, one or two degrees off could land you in a totally different city. Community can keep you on target like a GPS in your spiritual journey.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Choose today to invite someone into a decision you are making. You can start by journaling about the topic and who you are going to involve.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%206&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 6</a></p>
