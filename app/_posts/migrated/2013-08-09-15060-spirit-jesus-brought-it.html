<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Spirit: Jesus Brought It</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus is God in the flesh, but the story continues as Jesus left his Spirit for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203:16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 3:16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">John the baptizer is speaking here, and he was baptizing people like crazy to prepare their hearts to recognize Jesus. Baptism in water continues to be a key way that we express public commitment to Jesus as our Savior and our Lord. But we cant ignore that Jesus gift to us is to baptize us in the Spirit, to dunk us in the fullness of himself.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Picture yourself being submerged completely in Gods essence--his Holy Spirit. Journal about it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
