<html><body><p class="noPspace">Each year, an army of volunteers impact Cincinnati through various service projects in a one-day, citywide blitz of compassion. Working alongside other churches, we show love to hundreds of community-based organizations throughout our city. GO Cincinnati will happen again this year on Saturday, May 19. We’ll be tackling over 350 projects in Oakley, Florence and Mason and we need project leaders to meet with the organizations we serve, manage all the details and lead volunteers to complete the job. If you’d like to lead a project, <a title="go cincinnati" href="">click here </a>for more info and to sign up.</p></body></html>
