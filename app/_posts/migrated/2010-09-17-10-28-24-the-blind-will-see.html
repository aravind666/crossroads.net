<p class="noPspace">In our efforts to bless the people of Mamelodi, we hope to leverage  the goodwill of other partners who can bring much needed expertise and  resources to the table. We have had many fruitful discussions with  universities and medical schools, international and South African  non-profits and corporations.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">One of the most encouraging relationships  we’ve built is with Luxottica corporation’s global non-profit, <a title="One Sight" href="http://www.onesight.org">OneSight. </a> Headquartered just down the street from our Mason site, OneSight runs  free eye clinics all over the world, giving out thousands of free  eyeglasses and sunglasses in the process.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Over the next two weeks, OneSight, Charity &amp;  Faith (our partner   church) and Crossroads are working together to run  free eye clinics in   Mamelodi for over 10,000 people!  A team of eye doctors  and support   people from around the world (including 15 from Crossroads)  are now on   their way to South Africa, while an army of Charity &amp;  Faith   volunteers are going door to door in some of the toughest  neighborhoods   of Mamelodi to hand out tickets for the clinics, often by   candlelight.  In an area of South Africa with little access to eye care,   these  clinics will offer to many their first opportunity to have  their  vision  checked by an eye doctor, potentially identifying and  thwarting   blindness-causing diseases, or allowing a middle-aged  Mamelodian the   chance to read a book or drive a car for the first time  since his/her   eyesight went bad years ago.</p>
