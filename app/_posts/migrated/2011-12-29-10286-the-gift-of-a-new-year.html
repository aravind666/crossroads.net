<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Madeleine LEngle, writer, on new years:</p>

<p class="noPspace">"One time when I went with my children to the planetarium I was fascinated to hear the lecturer say that the primitive people used to watch the sun drop lower on the horizon in great terror because they were afraid that one day it was going to go so low that it would never rise again; they would be left in unremitting night...And then, just as it seemed there would never be another dawn, the sun would start to come back; each day it would rise higher, set later.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Somewhere in the depths of our unconsciousness we share that primordial fear, and when there is the first indication that the days are going to lengthen, our hearts, too, lift with relief. The end has not come: joy! and so a new year makes its birth known."</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of the kind of person you want to be this new year--whether thats a quick forgiver, someone who gives the benefit of the doubt, a husband who sacrifices daily for his wife, a friend who doesnt gossip. God will prompt you if you ask. Then practice being that person today.</p>
