<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Be the New Man</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Over the last few weeks, The Daily has taken a deeper look at what the Bible says about being a man. Today, well wrap up this series.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to help you grow and mature.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A41-52&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 2:41-52</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Even Jesus had to grow and mature to become a man. In the temple that day, there was something different about him. He wasnt a boy anymore, but a man who obediently followed God. Even his parents, Mary and Joseph, saw something different. For all men who decide to follow and obey God, something is different. Theyre no longer tied to what the world says. Instead, the New Man lives according to Gods calling: to take a minority position, to work hard, to follow, to protect and to run after a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Men throughout the Bible listened for God and obeyed him. Today, spend a minute or two listening for what God might be saying to you. Whatever it is, big or small, do what Hes telling you.</p>
