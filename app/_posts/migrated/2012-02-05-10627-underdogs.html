<p class="noPspace"><strong>Underdogs</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:26-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 1:26-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Why is it we love to root for the underdog? Maybe its because we love the thought of the little guy overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles and beating the odds to win in the end. Maybe its because we often feel like underdogs in our own lives. Todays scripture reading says that God chooses the weak things of the world "so that no one may boast before him." God wants the glory for the victories he wins on our behalf so the other underdogs of the world know they can turn to him when theyre up against the odds and cant make it on their own.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Consider an area of your life where you feel like an underdog right now. Tell God how you feel, and ask for his favor. Turn the issue over to him, and trust that hell win the battle on your behalf. </p>
