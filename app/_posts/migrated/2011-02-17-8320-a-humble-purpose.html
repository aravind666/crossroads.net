<p><strong>Thursday, February 17</strong> <br>A Humble Purpose</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to find my ultimate worth and value in you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%208&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 8</a> (a refresher)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Why do you matter? Where do you find your value? Does it come from what people say about you, who youre dating, the extent of your education, the job you landed?</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to this song, our value comes from God himself. The God who created everything from nothing placed us just below himself. Imagine that. God himself says that in the overall ranking of value for all existence, you come in at #2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That is why you matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>It can be difficult for us to feel this value amid the grind of day to day life. Spend a few minutes asking God to show you how he values you today in a practical, observable way that you can understand.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT<br></strong></p>
