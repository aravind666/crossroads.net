<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is Humble</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man follows before he leads. This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about men who have been rewarded for remaining diligent, accountable, and connected to God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you a way you can be humble.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A3-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 2:3-9</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Guys on TV show us that being humble is just another way to be weak. You cant be taken seriously if youre following somebody elses lead. But God says something different. Over and over again men who follow God experience success in their work and relationships because they humbly give up control of their own situations and listen for Gods voice.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You cant follow God if youre not listening. Make space today to spend time listening to God. Keep notes of what he brings to mind and think about how you can follow him.</p>
