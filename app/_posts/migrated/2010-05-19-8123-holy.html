<p>Holy <strong><br></strong><em><br> Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.<br></em><br><strong><br>READ<br></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2099&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 99</a><br><br><strong><br>REFLECT<br></strong>God is holy. That doesnt mean He just floats around on clouds; it means he is set apart, and his ways are perfect. <br> <br> Imagine a God so just, so perfect and so powerful that He makes the earth tremble and even heroic guys like Moses are afraid to look him in the face. This isnt because of fear as we typically understand it, but out of awe and complete worship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And God calls his people to be holy, too. <br><br><strong><br>RESPOND<br></strong>Think about what it means to be set apart, perfect, different. Then, imagine your life if you set yourself apart from how other people think you should live, and instead lived the life God wants for you: a life of holiness.<br> <br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK<br></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Peter%201:13-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 1:13-16<br><br><br></a></p>
