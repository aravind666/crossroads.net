<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:5-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:5-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Can you imagine your lifes legacy statement being the guy who pleased God? God chose to bless Enochs faithfulness. After living for 365 years, God scooped him up, and Enoch escaped the sting of death. He lived his life with eternity in mind, and God rewarded him with a triumphant entry into eternity.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If we look at everything we do, from cutting our toenails to interacting with the store clerk, as an eternal act--how might it affect the way that we approach the everyday. Journal about it, then live it, today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10</a></p>
