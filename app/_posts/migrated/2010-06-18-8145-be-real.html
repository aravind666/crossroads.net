<p><strong>Friday, June 18 </strong><br> Be Real</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes talking to God about whats been going on in your daily life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><br><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%201:11-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 1:11-16</a></p>
<p><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its been said that courage isnt the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you consider Paul, and his self-described timidity, you realize that while fear most certainly existed as he traveled around the ancient world sharing the dangerous message of Jesus, his fear was overshadowed by the courage and conviction he had about spreading that important message. And because of his courage, we sit here today, two thousand years later, men and women who have heard and received Jesus because of men and women like Paul.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paul decided something else was more important than fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Chasing after Jesus and living that adventure doesnt mean youll never have fear again, but Jesus message of hope is more important than the fear of rejection, ridicule or persecution.</p>
<p>Are you being called to do something that terrifies you? Write it down, then ask God to fill you with the courage you need to step into the adventure he has planned for you.</p>
<p></p>
