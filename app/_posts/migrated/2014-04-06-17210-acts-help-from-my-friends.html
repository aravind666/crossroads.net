<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives. And check out a <strong>Beans and Rice Week</strong> video each day to help you make the most of your meals.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+14%3A19-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 14:19-23</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Not everyone was happy when Paul came to town. In fact, there were plenty of people who wanted his message about Jesus derailed. Here, Paul is stoned and left for dead. But his friends took care of him and the next day he had the strength and courage to go back to the city. Like Paul, whenever we hit a wall or were suffering, its easier to handle when we have friends who can love and support us.</p>
