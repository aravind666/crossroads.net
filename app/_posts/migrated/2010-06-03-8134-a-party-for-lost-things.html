<p>A Party for Lost Things</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><br><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2015:1-32&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 15:1-32</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its important to notice Jesus audience for these stories. Hes surrounded by sinners, people who the religious elite (who were also listening) had already written off as lost causes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So He directs these stories toward the religious leaders to make a point about the very people who they have condemned. Many principles can be taken from these stories, but when we read them as a group, it seems that one stands out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God parties. He celebrates. He gets excited when one of his lost causes comes back home. For Jesus, there is no one so lost that they cant be found, and all are worth celebrating.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>It can be hard for us to feel this way, but the truth is that God really does celebrate when we come back to him. Go back and reread verses 22-24 several times and imagine hearing God saying those words about you. As you encounter things that could bring you down today, remember that God himself celebrates you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Zephaniah%203:17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Zephaniah 3:17</a> (Read it a few times, letting the image sink in.)</p>
