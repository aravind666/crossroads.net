<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus continues to teach today about how he values us as we look at a passage in Luke.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:24-26&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Luke 12:24-26</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus is letting you know how very much God cherishes you. (Reread verse 24 if you missed how much your Father values you.) You have a choice to listen to the voice of worry or to trust the voice of a good God who loves you. If you choose to invest your energy in worry, you will see it doesnt impact a single part of your life in a beneficial way. Dont do it. Dont invest more deeply in worry. Try investing in trust in God, and listen for his voice as he tells you your value to him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have a journal dialogue with God. Tell him about your worry, and then journal his response to the areas of your life that cause you stress.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 12</a></span></p>
