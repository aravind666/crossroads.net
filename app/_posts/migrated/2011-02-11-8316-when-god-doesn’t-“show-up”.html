<p><strong>Friday, February 11 </strong><br> When God Doesnt Show Up</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, give me the courage to be emotionally honest with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2044&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 44</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Has someone ever let you down? Of coursethis is an experience common to most, if not all of humanity. They were late, they broke a promise, they told your secret, they didnt do what they said they would. In other words, they didnt show up when you needed them most.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But what do you do when that person is God?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If this song is any indication, you get angry. Full-on, raging mad. This journey of following God is not all good times, yet God is big enough (and caring enough) to hear our anger and heartache throughout it all.</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are we close enough with God that we will tell him when were angry? Thats the kind of relationship He wants with us. Take a few minutes to talk with Godjust talkabout your comfort level in opening up to him.</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT<br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 4" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204&amp;version=NIV">Acts 4</a></p>
