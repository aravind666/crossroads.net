I have rarely thought of humility as a conscious choice. Instead, I've often thought of it more as something that you either <em>have</em> or you <em>don't</em>. <br>
<br>
In doing some reading this week, I came across a verse in the book of
Daniel in the bible. It describes a scene in which an angel visits
Daniel to give him direction and a vision for what's about to happen.
One particular thing the angel said struck me:<br>
<br>
<em>"Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your
mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your
words were heard, and I have come in response to them." </em><strong>Daniel 10:12</strong><br>
<br>
Humility and understanding seem to go hand in hand. For those of us who grew up with the <a href="/messages/2008-01-20-squad.html">Schoolhouse Rock</a> mantra <em>"it's great to learn, 'cause knowledge is power"</em>,
it can be tempting to think that information = understanding = power.
In reality, what we seem to see in the bible is that humility is the
beginning of understanding, and that acting on our understanding leads
to wisdom. <em>If we want to know God, it all begins with the act of humbling ourselves.</em><br>
<br>
I am challenged to develop the discipline of humble seeking and to
apply the discipline of "humbling myself" to my relationships and my
work. Sure beats eating "humble pie."<br>
