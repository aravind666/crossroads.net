<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">My husband and I recently went on vacation to New Orleans. It is a beautiful city. There are many wonderful people there and a rich culture. There are also some hurting people. We sat for lunch at an outside restaurant and soon our lunch dramatically changed when someone sitting at a table beside us made negative, judgmental comments of each person who walked by on the street. My heart hurt seeing how the world judges, but God sees the person inside and knows and loves them uniquely. I found myself hurting for this person who can only see people in this world and not in Gods Kingdom. I love focusing on how God sees this world and his people.</p>
