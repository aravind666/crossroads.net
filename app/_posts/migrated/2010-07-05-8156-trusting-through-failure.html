<p><strong>Week 2: Peter - A Trust Study</strong></p>

<p>Trusting through Failure</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Jesus, I invite you into the places in my life where I have failed. Show me how you see me.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2022:31-34&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 22:31-34</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus uses an image, here, of wheat. Wheat isnt really useful until its crushed. The chaff is then sifted away and the good kernel of wheat is left. Satan desires to crush and sift, but wants only chaff to remain. Jesus, however, knows that the crushing can lead to good harvest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus has an interesting prayer for Peter: it seems like a contradiction. How can Peter have faith that does not fail and yet turn back, which conveys that he would be going off-course? Because Jesus knows that within the next 24 hours, his disciple and friend will deny their relationship. Yet, he speaks to him with compassion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus ends with, When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers. Peters horrible breach of trust, a blatant denial, doesnt disqualify Peter for any of the good work of the Kingdom. Instead, what could be considered failure will somehow qualify him to strengthen others. This is not human view; and it confounds the evil one. Only the Father sees the full picture with the end in mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Peter denies knowing Christ but goes on to be one of the worlds first missionaries and founders of the Church. Is there something in your life that you think disqualifies you to be included in Gods story? Can you trust that God can use that as well? If you viewed it as sifting or refining, how might you be freed up to trust and follow?</p>
