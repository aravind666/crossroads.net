<p class="noPspace">A few years ago, it became clear that some survivors of sex trafficking were aging out of aftercare homes (facilities specifically for minors), but still needed help. “When I started the Mahima aftercare home, I knew that some of the girls would turn 18 soon, and returning home was not an option for them,” explains Smita Singh, Director of Aftercare and Counseling.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak">Her vision: a transition home to bridge the gap between aftercare and independence. “The transition home would give these older girls a window of two years in which they would train for a job, get help with placement, and be on their way to self-sufficiency,” Smita explains.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In early 2011, Crossroads partnered with Jatiyo Kristiyo Prochar Samity (JKPS), a Christian community development organization based in West Bengal, to make Smita’s idea a reality. The Mahima Transition Home in Kolkata turned one year old this July, and today, eight young women and one child live in this facility. All are doing great as they gain computer skills, learn tailoring, take beautician classes, get on-the-job training in baking and hospitality, and learn to commute to work on their own.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Smita couldn’t be happier to see the success of the transition home she envisioned several years ago. “God is working in their lives,” she says. “They are much calmer and at peace with where they are and what they are doing. One of the girls asked whether we could start Bible classes at the home. Another one mentioned that she felt a sense of peace when she was transferred to Mahima from another home. Our God is a miracle-working God, and we believe that miracles will happen in the lives of these precious girls.”</p>
