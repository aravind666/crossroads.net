<p class="noPspace">Day 7 and 8</p>
<p class="noPspace">We were invited to dinner last night with the founder of Vision Rescue, Pastor Biju Thampy and his key director. His organization is partnering with Crossroads to support our first transition home for girls over 18 in Mumbai. They also are breaking ground on a new Dream Centre, which will house 96 girls.</p>
<p class="noPspace">We were up early today to drive to the transition home. It is in a residential area outside the city. The home has recently been painted and renovations are under way to meet licensing requirements. The home will support up to 20-25 girls. We spent time interacting with the leaders of the organization over tea, biscuits and sandwiches. We had the opportunity to walk through the home and pray in each room for the girls that will live there in the future. They asked us to pray that the licensing and MOU (memo of understanding) are approved by the government in the next few weeks.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We loaded back into the cars to drive through the countryside to the future site of the Dream Centre. It is in a beautiful location with rice fields and low mountains. We even drove by a waterfall (only visible in the rainy season). There are 8 acres of property and plans for 4 phases to be completed over the next 2 years. Phases 1 and 2 will be 96-bed homes for trafficked girls, phase 3 will be a home for street boys and a chapel, and phase 4 will be a facility for education and social enterprise. They expect to have phase 1 completed by January 2012. The workers were working on the foundation and outer walls while we were there. We walked around the site (in our monsoon boots), and some of us climbed on top of the foundations of one of the buildings. It was an amazing experience to stand on top of the foundations of the building and pray. We prayed for the future of the home and the life it will provide for the least, the last and the lost. Then, we went to a local restaurant and had a traditional Indian lunch with Pastor Thampy and his team.</p>
<p class="noPspace">On the way back, we divided up into two groups  one met for dinner with Pastor Vivian Fernandes, and the other group went to Bandra for an Italian meal and shopping with Jamie Elkins (our Crossroads on the ground link with Crossover). We met back at the hotel and planned for our last day in Mumbai. Friday, we will be going to the Crossover Foundations office (called the bungalow) for a debrief and then head to the airport to come back to Cincy. This is the last blog, but we will be back soon and well be eager to share our experiences!</p>
