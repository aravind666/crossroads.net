<p class="noPspace"><strong>PATS PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When I first started going to church I didnt like it even though I got a lot of free pizza and they always told me how great I was, but it was awful. At least I thought so---I just didnt like church. I thought Jesus was cool and all, but not for me. This small community persisted in showing me why I should give Jesus a shot. But I decided they didnt deserve my time.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Its been 5 years since Ive seen any of these people. But now I love Jesus and Ive shown them no appreciation for their patient persistence in showing me Jesus love. Ive used that church as an example of a place I didnt like and I havent spoken positively about them. But quite frankly, God used them to change my life.</p>

<p class="noPspace">I will thank them. I will write to them and share my story and the impact they had on me. I hope they are proud, I hope they understand the good they have done for me, and I hope they forgive my lack of appreciation. Im not a very emotional or sentimental guy, but as I write, its really teaching me something more about gratitude. Every good thing is from God, and they were simply reminding me how God feels about me.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Try it again. Think of someone or a type of person in your life who you treat as a person beneath you. Take an action that shows them Gods love. Dont get caught up in the execution---the point is knowing that your worth and the worth of that other person is rooted in God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 10</a></p>
