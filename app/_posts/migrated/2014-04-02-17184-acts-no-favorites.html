<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next few weeks, The Daily will follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you someone who doesnt know Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10%3A21-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 10:21-33</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus told us to go and make disciples of all nations. But the Jewish nation was the only one where people were coming along and following Jesus. Until Peter met Cornelius, a non-Jew. It was sort of weird, but the Holy Spirit spoke to them both separately and then brought them together. Through this, Peter learned that God doesnt show favoritism and we cant eitherespecially when it comes to telling others about Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of your friends or people in your family who dont know Jesus. Invite them to a service or start a simple conversation---it doesnt even have to be about God---to bring them into whats happening in your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>EAT CHEAPLY, CHANGE THE WORLD</strong></p>
