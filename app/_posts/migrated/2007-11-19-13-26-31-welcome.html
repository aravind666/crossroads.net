Hey, all you early adopters!<br /><br />Welcome to the all-new crossroads.net and thanks for creating your user account. This will be your spot for all things Crossroads, and a great way to get you connected with opportunities and resources in and outside of our community, so check back frequently.<br /><br />We'll be adding all kinds of new content (and squashing bugs where we find them) over the coming days and weeks. But if you haven't already, take some time to look around and discover some of the cool stuff on the site. Our most frequently visited area so far is the <a href=\"../my/media/music.php\" title=\"Music Downloads\">music section</a>, where you can download original Crossroads music. Also, there's already some activity happening on the <a href=\"../corkboard/\" title=\"Corkboard\">corkboard</a> and in the <a href=\"../forum/\" title=\"Forum\">discussion forum</a>.<br /><br />More to come...
