<p><strong>Wednesday, May 18 </strong><br>The Spirit of Faithfulness</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before reading the scripture today, spend a minute just being quiet and preparing to hear Gods voice.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=romans%2012:1-2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"> Romans 12:1-2</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It might sound counter-intuitive, but you can have faith in God and still not live with faithfulness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Faithfulness to God means you dont bury your relationship with him. Your whole life reflects the love between you--not just on weekends, not just when youre volunteering, not just during conversations with fellow Christ-followers. Faithfulness is choosing to be a "living sacrifice" to God.Faithfulness to God centers your life and seeps into every part of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you where your faithlessness lies. Consider one way that you could start releasing its grip on your life and filling that part with His Spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2020&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 20</a></p>
