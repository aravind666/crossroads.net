<p><strong>Wednesday, October 6</strong> <br>Haggai</p>
<p><br><em>Prayer: Jesus, teach me what it means for me to help advance your kingdom</em>.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Haggai%201:4-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Haggai 1:4-9</a></p>
<p><br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>Have you ever spent money on something thats in fashion, just to look at it later and laugh or regret the purchase? Have you ever slaved over something that seemed so important at the time, only to realize later that it wasnt worth the sacrifice you made?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes we put too much value on building our own house and lose sight of Gods much bigger (and much cooler) mission for his Kingdom. We have the opportunity to spend our resources on things that last. An investment we never need to regret, laugh at, or wonder if it was worth it.</p>
<p><br>Haggai prophesies the coming of the new house, Jesus. Through his words, we can see that its through Jesus that were made to be the temple of the Holy Spirit functioning in a community, the church, to change the world.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong> <br>Spend some time in quiet and ask the Holy Spirit to teach you where your resources are going, and what it would look like if God took hold of them.</p>
