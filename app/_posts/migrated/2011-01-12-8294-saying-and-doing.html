<p>Saying and Doing</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me see, today, how my identity lies completely in you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%201:22-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 1:22-25</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.</p>
<p>A quote from Batman Begins might seem out of place here, but its exactly the connection that James makes between our words and our actions. In verse 23, James points out that Gods word is like a mirror: it reflects our true identity. Put simply, our words and actions are inseparable. Like Batman (minus the plastic six-pack) we are meant to be men and women of action. We are either moving aggressively toward the things of God, or we have forgotten our true identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Make an aggressive, action-oriented decision today. Following God has never been safe, has never been easy, and it has never been without risk. But when we live in such a way that our words and actions connect, we are living out our true identity in Jesus.</p>
