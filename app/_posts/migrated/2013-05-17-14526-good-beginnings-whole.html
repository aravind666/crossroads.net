<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good Beginnings: Whole</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday in Genesis 1, man and woman were created. Genesis 2 gives more detail and we learn about our beginnings as man and woman. We will look at Genesis 2:21-25 for the rest of the week.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:21-22&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:21-22</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What a poetic story. At the beginning of time, man and woman separated out from one person. Then, there is a longing to bring back that which has been separated out. Maybe this is why you complete me from Jerry Maguire resonates with so many. We were intended to fit together. That fact brings on the fuller image of God--masculine and feminine.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write down your gender in your journal. Now look at the word, and ask God what he wants to teach you about fully representing him in that word. Now write down what you hear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 26</a></p>
