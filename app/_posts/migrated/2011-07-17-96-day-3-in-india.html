<p class="noPspace">Today was amazing.......seriously. Today I found out that the group we have can handle anything. Our plan was to go to the Vasai Baptist Church to worship, then conduct a Kids Camp with the children from the church. Well, with most things India....the schedule changed. What should have been a 30 minute drive, turned in to an almost 2 hour drive (because of traffic on a Sunday morning........traffic pops up on all days at all times).</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">So we caught the last 15 mins of the worship service. It was simple, but powerful. Worshiping with brothers and sisters 9000 miles away is a unifying experience.....and makes me realize just how awesome our God is.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Then the plan was to have about 30 mins to travel down the street to set up for our Kids Camp. Well, we showed up and to our surprise there were already 50 kids waiting on us..........in a semi-open classroom.....in the pooring rain! I came close to freakin out, but everyone else launched in to action. I was certainly proud of our group. I tried to upload a picture of what we were contending with.....but it wont load. All I can say is that I have never in my life been in such a pounding rain for such an extended period of time. It was crazy.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Colleen Crawford led the Kids Camp and did an absolutely amazing job. I dont know Colleen outside of this trip, but what she did today shows me alot about the person she is. Her and the entire team pulled off a great Kids Camp and helped launch a relationship with a church who we hope will partner with us in the future for the work here in India. It was a great start.</p>

<p class="noPspace">As we left our new friends, it struck me that while I drive around this sometimes crazy, completely foreign city and think our two cultures are so different in so many ways..........I realized today that the similarities far outway the differences.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Tomorrow we meet with the pastors of the children we interacted with today. If today was any indication......its gonna be a great day!</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Until tomorrow......</p>
