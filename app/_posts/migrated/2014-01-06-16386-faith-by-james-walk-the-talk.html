<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: Walk the Talk</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to open your mind to whatever he wants to teach you today. And if theres anything you need to get off your chest, first, He is listening. Start the conversation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202:18-20&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">James 2:18-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">James is writing about walking the talk. Heres an example: take what it is you really like to do---what youre really passionate about. Lets say its cooking. Great! Because you like to cook, you have a stack of cookbooks with greased pages and youre always trying out a new recipe. Your friends say you smell like garlic. Thats walking the talk.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we love God and have a relationship with him, our lives show it. Our faith becomes very real and very practical.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Fill in the blank: If I would say that I trust God to take care of me, today I will act on my trust by doing this: _____________. (If nothing comes to mind, ask God or a wise friend to give you ideas. Then, go walk the talk.)</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 2</a></p>
