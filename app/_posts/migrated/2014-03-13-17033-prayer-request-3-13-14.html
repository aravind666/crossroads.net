<p class="noPspace">My aunt is having surgery to replace a plate in her hip with a plate extending the entire length of her femur. She is 77 years old but a total fighter and a believer. Please pray for her and the surgeons on Friday (3/14)! Thank you! Jocelyn</p>

<p class="noPspace">Hello! Im really struggling with a stressful situation and its crushing me. Because of a rare brain condition I was diagnosed with 10 years ago, my finances continually are a stress in my life. I started a business recently, then shortly after ended up in the hospital and Ive financially gotten so stressed that Ive pretty much curled up in a ball and keep praying it will all just go away. I love what Im doing but its too much with what is going on. I have recently been throwing myself back into church, payed my tithes for the first time and am seeking a better relationship with god. I beg everyday to get through the financial mess Ive caused but I know he doesnt answer every prayer and Im drowning. Any prayers would be appreciated. Thank you. Jessica</p>
