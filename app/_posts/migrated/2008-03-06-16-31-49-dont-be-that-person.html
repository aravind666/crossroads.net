Just a reminder, all. <strong>Don't be THAT person</strong>. <br /><br />You know...the one who forgets to &quot;<a href=\"http&#58;//aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/daylight_time.php\">SPRING FORWARD</a>&quot; and shows up <em>an hour late</em> to everything on Sunday.<br /><br /><strong>Make sure you change your clocks on Saturday night. </strong>You won't want to miss <a href=\"http&#58;//www.ijm.org/whoweare/garyhaugen\">Gary Haugen</a> speaking this weekend.
