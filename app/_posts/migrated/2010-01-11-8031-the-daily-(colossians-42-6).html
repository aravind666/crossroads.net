<strong>Monday, January 11</strong><br>Practical Wisdom<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Colossians 4:2-6<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Paul (the writer of this letter to an early group of Christ followers) defines wisdom as making the most of any given opportunity. It has nothing to do with giving sage advice or having the answers to all the unknowns of life. It is simply making the most of opportunities God places in our path. <br><br>Put simply, wisdom is about focusfocus on the situation at hand and what can be done with it.<br><br>This means that anyone is capable of being wise. You dont have to be smart, talented, rich, or powerful to be wise. You simply have to take advantage of opportunity.<br><ul>
<li>How does this definition of wisdom make you feel?</li>
<li>What is one way you can be wise today?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>This kind of focus requires that we be prepared for what opportunities may come. Take a few minutes to write down how you can be prepared and best respond to the opportunity you identified above. Then ask God to help you be wise in this situation.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Ecclesiastes 3:1-8<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">If you are new to The Daily, <a style="color: #3a6e8f; text-decoration: none" href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt"><span>   <br></span></span>
