It's Election Day, and six precincts are voting at Crossroads. It's awesome to see the people who are braving the 40-ish degrees and rain to come and vote, and once they are in the building we welcome them&nbsp; with a hot cup of&nbsp; free coffee. <br /><br />I wish the people holding the signs outside would come in for some coffee (without their signs, of course). They look really wet.
