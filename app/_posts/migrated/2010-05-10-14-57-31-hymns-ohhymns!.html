<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="/uploadedfiles/1/lavish_190x110.jpg" alt="Lavish" width="190" height="110" />As you probably noticed last weekend we're in a new series called <strong>Lavish</strong> in which we're doing a deep dive on the subject of grace. Over the next several weeks we will be singing some <em>older</em> songs that were classics of later Church history. (Yes, even the songs that we think of as "classic, old" songs are from the last 10% of Church history. Think about it.) We've recorded and posted them in the music section on the site for everyone to download and enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can download the songs in the <a href="/downloads/music.php">music section</a>.</p>
