<p>Feed my Sheep</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Jesus, teach me to follow and trust you as Lord and as a brother.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%2021:15-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 21:15-19</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus has died and resurrected at this point. He has just appeared to the disciples on shore while some of them are out fishing. Peter, of course, leaps in the water at the realization that it is Jesus; he swims in while the others row to shore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Jesus has this conversation with Peter, repeating his question and his instruction three times. Curiously, its the same number of times Peter denied knowing Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus wants Peter to trust him as Lord and as a friend or brother. He also wants him to care for his sheep: the people who follow him. Then Jesus points out the way Peter will ultimately be martyred. (In a refusal to be executed the same way as his Lord, Peter was crucified upside down.) Even with this allusion to the future, Jesus leaves Peter with the same calling from which their relationship began: Follow me. And Peter will heed this call.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When you think of following Jesus, is it the way you would follow a friend or as you would follow a command? How is this impacting your trust of God?</p>
<p></p>
