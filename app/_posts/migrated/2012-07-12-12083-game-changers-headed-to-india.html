<p class="noPspace">Growing up in a home where she was taught about world needs and our call to serve the least of these, Cheryl Murray Miyamasu was certainly no stranger to the realities of injustice. However, something sparked a fire in her.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Cheryl heard about the overwhelming number of girls trapped in sex trafficking in India and saw a film about what life was like in a brothel. She was struck by the lie that they somehow were not worthy of the justice we take for granted. Cheryl tucked this away in her heart for the time beingknowing that someday, somehow, shed find her way to India.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">In college, she met her husband Dave and shared with him her passion for serving others and for India in particular. As their relationship grew, so did their awareness of global human trafficking and their heart for doing something about it. They started by financially supporting various organizations involved in India. Then they moved to Cincinnati and joined Crossroads; helping to fight injustice locally by becoming active in Whiz Kids and participating in GO NOLA 2009. It was in January 2011 that they found their chance to go to India. For two weeks, Cheryl and Dave worked with groups of people belonging to lowest Hindu caste, the Dalits (a group of people traditionally regarded as <a title="Untouchability" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchability">untouchable</a> and unclean). That trip served as a barometer for both of us with each other and with the Lord. We both came back feeling the same confirmation. We were going back, and it was going to be for a longer term, Dave recalls.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">In one month, through the Game Change initiative, Dave and Cheryl will be doing just thatputting their trust in God as they leave to serve for two years with Crossover Foundation in Mumbai. Dave will be helping the organization leaders with business, database and technological work, and Cheryl will be helping to train the aftercare team in Mumbai on trauma, coping and life skills.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">We want our marriage to be about more than pursuing the American Dream, says Dave. We want to live our faith in tangible waysloving those who are hurting, fighting for those who are oppressed, and serving those in need.</p>

<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Of course, the need for justice isnt limited to India, and work of justice is certainly not limited to those who can make a two-year commitment to move half-way around the world. The only thing required for fire is a little spark, and there are many options as to what that spark may be. Dave and Cheryls story is a great example for all of usan inspiration to <a href="/reachout/">get in the game and reach out</a>.</p>
