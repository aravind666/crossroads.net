<p>Father Knows Best</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%206:35-40&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 6:35-40</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>At some level, we know right from wrong, as we know right from left. But sometimes we still choose left or we resist moving at all. Why? Whose will are we following? Whose kingdoms are we building?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two kinds of people: those who say to God, Thy will be done, and those to whom God says, All right, then, have it your way. (C.S. Lewis)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus knew whose will he was following. Not His own, but his Fathers. When we ask for Gods will to be done, we are submitting to his authority. And when we follow His will, we are helping restore his kingdom on earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider the things that are troubling you right now and tell God, Not mine, but Your will be done. How can submitting your will to Gods authority make you more free?</p>
<p></p>
