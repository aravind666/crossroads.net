<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">No pain, no gain. We say it all the time when we find ourselves in hard situations. Generally, were OK with suffering---we know life cant be painless and we have some sense that well grow or mature as a result of it. But it seems like suffering sneaks up on us every time and we do what we have to do just to get over it. Whatever that may be, when were suffering we give ourselves permission to change, sometimes for the worse.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Consider it pure joy to suffer, says James. Whether it be a hard conversation at work or pushing yourself to run an extra mile, stay focused on the joy in a hard situation.</p>
