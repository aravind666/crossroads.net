<strong>Wednesday, January 13</strong><br>Choose Your Friends Wisely<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Proverbs 4<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Throughout the book of Proverbs, Solomon consistently beats this drum: your friends determine the direction and quality of your life.<br><br>While not an absolute rule, it is true more often than wed like to admit. For good or bad, all of us have been significantly influenced by key relationships. Many of our best (and worst) moments have come because of the prodding and inspiration of a close friend. Friends can influence our behavior, our occupation, and even our choices about where to live or who to marry.<br><br>As a result, choosing friends wisely is crucial.<br><ul><li>How has a past friendship impacted your life negatively? Positively?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Whats the biggest lesson your past has taught you about how to choose friends?</li></ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>One of the ways God frequently speaks is through the people around us, and many times we dont recognize the impact until much later. Think of someone who had a significant positive impact on the direction of your life, and take a few minutes to thank God for them. You might even consider writing them a thank-you note as well.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK<br></strong>Proverbs 1:10-19<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">f you are new to The Daily, <a style="color: #3a6e8f; text-decoration: none" href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt"><span>   <br><br><br></span></span>
