<html><body><p>Sign-ups for<a href="/my/connect/communityGroups.php" title="Comm Group page"> community groups</a> are under way. One of the more popular groups is Dave Ramsey's <strong>Financial Peace University,</strong>
which teaches about eliminating debt, staying out of debt, building
wealth and learning to live more generously. Sasha and Therese, a
couple who completed FPU last spring, talk about why it's a great
community group.<br><br><strong>Why did you sign up for FPU?</strong><br>We
were striving to be better stewards of our money. We had always had
some type of budget; however, we never really paid attention to the
fact that we would go over in several categories. We knew we needed
help.<br><br><strong>What made the greatest impact on you?</strong><br>The
biggest impact was teaching us to know and change our behavior
patterns. Everyone knows you should save more and spend less. It's
actually doing it that's tough.<br><br><strong>Why would you recommend this class to others?</strong><br>Yes. It was all very practical and useful -- not over our heads. God truly blessed us by allowing us to attend FPU.<br><br>FPU starts this Saturday, but it's not too late to <a href="/my/connect/communitygroups/CG-DescFinancialPeaceUniversitySaturdaymornings.htm" title="FPU sign up">sign up.</a></p></body></html>
