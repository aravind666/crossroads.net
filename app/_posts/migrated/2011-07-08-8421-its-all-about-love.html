<p>Its All About Love</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, remove any obstacles from my life that prohibit me from receiving more of you and your love.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:%2021-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 14: 21-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>As children, we often show our parents affection through hugs, kisses and</p>
<p>handmade gifts. But one of the best ways to show them love is by obeying them. Thats</p>
<p>because love is more than a warm feeling; its an attitude that reveals itself in action.</p>
<p>When  we love someone, we become willing to set aside our own feelings and  desires for the other person. We naturally want to please them and make  them happy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obedience is also the way that we show God that we love him. Jesus is pretty clear</p>
<p>about it, and he even repeats it several times. And as we obey, we experience Jesus</p>
<p>love in deeper ways. More of Gods character is revealed to us and we can</p>
<p>draw even closer to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>On  paper, reflect on all the ways that God has shown his love for  you-maybe its how he has watched out for you, or prospered you through  unexpected success in a business, or maybe youre especially thankful  for your family and friends. Write down the ways you feel blessed. Also,  highlight blessings youve received as a direct result of obedience to  God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 3</a></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks</em></p>
<p><em>content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your</em></p>
<p><em>roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How  do you hear from God? Are there things that you can do, or things that  need to be removed from your life, so that you can hear Him more  clearly?</li>
<li>Think of a time when you were obedient to God. Did you feel closer to Him? In what ways? Describe how this made you feel.</li>
<li>None of us are are perfect, and weve all been disobedient at some point in our lives. Talk about any specific barriers that you have faced in following through on what God has asked of you.</li>
</ul>
