<p><strong>Week 3: Game Change</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, October 25</strong></p>
<p>Game Change</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>During Game Change, The Daily will serve the role of encourager during the spiritual journey we began a few weekends ago at Crossroads. Well start the week with a heads-up about the guide and spend the next few days revisiting important ideas from the weekend message. (If you didnt pick up a guide this weekend, you can <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/documents/1/gamechangeguide_web.pdf">download it here</a>.)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2046:10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 46:10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This weekend, Chuck discussed the importance of listening to God about the stuff in our life. He emphasized the need for us to "lengthen the listen" by planning times to strategically hear from God.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>How are you going to lengthen the listen in your life this week? What are some specific ways you will carve out time to hear from God?</p>
