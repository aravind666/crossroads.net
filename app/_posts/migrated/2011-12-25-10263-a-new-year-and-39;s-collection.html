<p class="noPspace"><strong>A New Years Collection</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:5-8&amp;version=MSG">Matthew 10:5-8</a> (The Message)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Spend some time asking God to remind you of ways youre wired to care for and love others.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This weeks Daily will be a little different: its a quick-hit collection of writing from some great authors out there and a sample of their teachings on love, grace, solitude, fellowship and entering a new year.</p>

<p class="noPspace">To start us off, heres something from C.S. Lewis about how to love:</p>

<p class="noPspace">To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.cslewis.com">C.S. Lewis</a>, The Four Loves</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The day-after Christmas can sometimes be a letdown. Todays charge: dont let it be. Find a way to give something away, help someone complete a task, or create an unexpected family re-gathering. Spend time loving.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 2</a></p>
