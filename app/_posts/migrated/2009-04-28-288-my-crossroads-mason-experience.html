It was my first time at Crossroads Mason without having a stage role. (I normally inhabit Crossroads Oakley, since that site is closest to our home in Mt. Lookout.)<br><br>Very, very impressive what our team is doing in Mason. When I say "our team" I mean the entire Crossroads team, consisting of volunteers and staff who make two sites happen every week. As an objective observer this past weekend, I had a few insights I needed to share:<br><br><h3>Top 10 Reasons why Mason is a Smashing Success</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>There was a buzz in the hallways at Mason.</strong> This was partly due to the energy that comes when you have a lot of people in a relatively confined space, unlike the vast atrium in Oakley. It was partly due to the energy of the Holy Spirit, who not only fills people, but also can permeate spaces. And it was partly due to a high percentage of people interacting with each other who go to the same schools or live in the same neighborhood.</li>
<li>
<strong>Classic Crossroads feel.</strong> With great free coffee and a comfortable, dark auditorium that protects the anonymity of our friends just checking things out, this place just feels like Crossroads. Our team spent a lot of time and money figuring out how to brew coffee onsite and upgrade the auditorium. It was worth it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dag! Look at all the people!</strong> I was expecting the first service to be light. Not really. At around 1,000 people every week, in just six months Crossroads Mason is already one of the 10 largest churches in the city.</li>
<li>
<strong>Its about the people.</strong> Sitting to my left was a guy who I didnt know before, but who worked for the title company who closed on my refinanced mortgage. Sitting in front of me was a woman who makes awesome soup that I eat regularly downtown. Sitting to my right was a young professional 20-something couple who appeared to be new seekers. How good is that?</li>
<li>
<strong>Great A/V.</strong> I reflected on my approval for the steep outlay in cash for the center high-def projector. It is well worth it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kicking band.</strong> It wasnt just great because they sounded great, but it was great to see fresh volunteers being able to serve. Some of them I had never seen before.</li>
<li>
<strong>Smiling volunteers in Kids Club and CSM.</strong> When Im in a church, one of the first things I look at to gauge the health of that church is the eyes of the volunteers. Eyes that are glazed out of obligation, bored out of fruitless monotony or pained out of endless difficulty are key signs that something needs to be addressed. Our volunteers eyes looked like expectant wolves, ready for fresh meat. (That sounds really weird and maybe inappropriate. But isnt that what blogs are for?) They were having fun serving and building into kids.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leaders come in all forms.</strong> People are stepping up all over the place to fill critical roles and make it happen in Mason. Our Campus Pastor Larry Plum is doing a killer job of making connections, mobilizing the Mason community and providing the leadership backbone for the Mason location. Beth Peery has done a tremendous job building an awesome experience for kids and volunteers in Kids Club. Volunteer leader Angie Ash transitioned from serving in Kids Club in Oakley to leading in Mason, and her husband Joel is leading the Fathers Community Group. Awesome.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rick Ruehlman</strong> (formerly an inactive seeker) was challenged years ago to use his leadership to honor God push and the Kingdom forward. Challenge accepted. Going for a ride after the service with this friend and key leader was a perfect end to the day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fresh passion for Anderson.</strong> It wasnt just that I recently had a meeting with volunteers in Anderson, but now that Ive had this fantastic and fresh experience at our second site (Oakley was the first), Im more convinced than ever that sites #3 through 300 are absolutely in Gods heart for the future of Crossroads.</li>
