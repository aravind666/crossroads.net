<p class="noPspace">Culture is created when a group shares beliefs, behaviors and common characteristics. We all belong to one or more cultural groups—but we don’t spend significant time thinking about how those cultural groups shape our behaviors and practices. So how do we know if we belong to a specific group? The easy answer is that we “follow the rules.”</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Each culture has accepted practices called rules or norms that represent the group as a whole. These rules are often “hidden” in that they are not often given much attention—simply thought of as the “right” or “proper way to do things.” The only point in time when we may be faced with the question of “why” a specific behavior is accepted is when we meet someone who has a different “rule” or norm—overtly positioning them “outside” of our group.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">The same is true of economic culture. In the previous blog entry we discussed three economic cultures: poverty, middle class and wealth, and how the measure of resources we have impact cultural practice and norms. Each of these economic cultures has common rules that cue us as to which economic group we belong.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">For example, for the economic class of poverty, the hidden rules applied to financial resources is to spend; for the middle class, it’s to “manage;” and for the upper class, it’s to invest. More closely, it’s very common for individuals from a culture of poverty to see financial management in terms of spending—because with limited resources, the majority of their income is directly spent on basic needs. Due to the fact that there are limited “extra” resources, there isn’t an opportunity to develop the rule or practice of financial management. Conversely, if we have “extra” financial resources above and beyond our basic expenses, then, out of necessity, we begin to adopt management practices including personal banking and long-term investing. What is critical is that both practices are considered “norms.” When confronted, we may judge or evaluate specific practices against our own—creating a cultural divide.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>As we look to the CityLink model to address local poverty, we have to remember that it isn’t about a specific resource alone—or about achieving a specific class status—it’s about building resources and practices that help an individual successfully thrive cross-culturally.</strong></p>
