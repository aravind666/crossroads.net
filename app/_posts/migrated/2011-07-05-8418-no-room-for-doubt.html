<p>No Room for Doubt</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, may you open my ears and help me to clearly hear your voice. May you quiet the interfering voices of doubt.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:%205-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 1:5-6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>A little boy sits in the floor, playing a game. His father instructs him to go to bed. Immediately, the little boy stands on his head. His dad asks, What are you doing? The boy replies, Well, you told me to stand on my head. The father is touched. Smiling, he scoops the boy up in his arms. No, son. I told you to go to bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Did the boy question or hesitate in his response to such a silly request? No. He just did it. He didnt need to know why, because he trusted the wisdom of his father. Obeying even what we think God is saying, is still a win. Like the father, God is delighted and proud of our hearts desire to obey. And if we misunderstand, He is there with clarity, and unconditional love. Our mistake is to allow doubt to interfere -- interfere with our obedience and therefore, interfere with our relationship with our Father.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend some quiet time with God and just ask him to talk to you. Write down what you hear. Dont assume He has a to-do list for you, he may just want to tell you how he feels about you, i.e. good, lovey stuff. Invite His wisdom in, and tell doubt this is an A/B conversation, so C your way out of it.</p>
