<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Youve Got Trouble</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to be with you in your present or future suffering.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A33&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 16:33</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Look around today and youll find it pretty difficult not to find someone who isnt suffering. It doesnt matter how big or small the circumstance, we all suffer. And if everything is good, the hard truth is that trouble is coming. Jesus even said so. As long as we are in this world, we will suffer. This week, well explore what we can do when we see trouble coming or when we are in the midst of suffering.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pick one thing that is causing you trouble. If Jesus is with you, how does that change your perspective? Spend some time with this thought---and remember that Jesus is ready to listen and help you through it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 9</a></p>
