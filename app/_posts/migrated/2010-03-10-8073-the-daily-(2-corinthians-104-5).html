<p>Evicting the Squatters </p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%2010:4-5&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The enemys lies cause unhealthy beliefs and behaviors that can be as tough to overcome as a military stronghold. These spiritual strongholds are like squatters who take over territory in our hearts and crowd out truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In your Free guide this week, youll be choosing a Bible passage to repeat daily. This is a fierce, unconventional weapon for evicting the squatters and living in freedom. Use it liberally.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Ask Jesus to help you lean into the power of the scriptures this week to crowd out lies and replace them with Gods truth and freedom.</p>
