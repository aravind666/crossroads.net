<p>Prayer is Refreshing</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me fall in love with your voice and spending time with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:22-25&amp;version=NIV">Acts 16:22-25</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>How is it that during a prison stay, after beatings and torture, two men can step outside their pain and sing to God? How could the weight of that situation be so lifted off their shoulders?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>In the beginning we are indeed the subject and the center of our prayers. But in Gods timeslowly, almost imperceptibly, there is a shift in our center of gravity. We pass from thinking of God as part of our life to the realization that we are part of his life. (Richard Foster, Prayer)</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are part of Gods life. As we build into our relationship with God by spending time with him and learning the beauty and intricacies of his character and of his plans for the world, we shift away from a self-centered, individual story and into a much bigger, grander story. And this shifting brings peace. It is refreshment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Whats an image that you can call to mind when you feel overwhelmed, and you need to remember this is all Gods story, and were just part of it? Hold onto that image. (If it helps, sketch it somewhere.) Use it as your tool for refreshment.</p>
<p></p>
