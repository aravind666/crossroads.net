<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for guidance.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+19%3A1-7&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 19:1-7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">These disciples didnt know that Jesus had come, rescued them and that they could receive the Holy Spirit. Sure, they had been baptized, but to them it was just a pledge of good behavior. Paul helped change that. He knew that when we are baptized in the name of Jesus we receive the Holy Spirit, someone who will guide us. And when we keep on believing, the possibilities of where the Spirit will take us are endless.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Where would you like the God to lead you? Think of an area of your life---a work situation, a relationship, a new adventure---and ask Him to guide you. It may not happen overnight, but believe that He will.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 19</a></p>
