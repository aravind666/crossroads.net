<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Come Near</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were learning what James has to teach us about humility.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 4:8-10</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our hearts really can fill with grieving and mourning when we realize weve rejected a God who desires a loving, intimate relationship with us. But the good news is, Hes always on our side, and always ready to draw near to us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, thank you for wanting an intimate relationship with me. Help me to grow closer to You and not the world.</p>
