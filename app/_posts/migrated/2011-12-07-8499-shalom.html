<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>"Shalom"  is the Jewish expression of peace, and its much fuller in meaning than  our common notion of peace as a state of calm or cease-fire. Rather,  shalom means a complete flourishing: a life thats fully engaged in what  God created it to be.</p>
<p>If Jesus had merely wanted calm, he would have just helped people get  along. He would have satiated them, like Caesar did, with more "bread  and circus." He would never have challenged people to change and grow.  But instead, He literally turned tables and upset the whole broken  system with his love. He didnt avoid turmoil; he moved through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think  of how you move through turmoil (who you talk to, where you find  relief, how you treat the people close to you). Is there anything about  that pattern youd like to change? Ask God to give you specific strength  in that area for the next time around.</p>
