<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Build Leaders: Receive</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God gives us spiritual authority and wants us to fully receive it. Today, focus on verse 4.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:1-4&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 39:1-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Potiphar realized that the Lord was with Joseph, and that pleased him. Because Joseph received the spiritual authority that God had given him, Potiphar recognized that authority. The more we fully recieve that the Lord gives us spiritual authority, the more of an example we set for others to easily receive, too.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a moment to think about ways that you can receive and implement your spiritual authority more often.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 5</a></p>
