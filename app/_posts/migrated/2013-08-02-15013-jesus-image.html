<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will look at a passage in Colossians that breaks down Jesus full identity. Read the whole passage, then reread verse 15. This is where well put our focus today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 1:15-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus full identity might be larger than we can even comprehend. He is fully human, and he is Gods son, but he is also fully God. God wanted to show himself to us in a way that our mind could comprehend--to meet us where we are. So he modeled a Godly life through Jesus. When the author of Colossians, Paul, points out that Jesus is also the firstborn over all creation--its reflecting that Jesus has been around since the beginning of time. Nothing was created without Him.</p>
