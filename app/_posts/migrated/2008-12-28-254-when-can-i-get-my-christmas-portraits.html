<html><body><p>So, let's say you forgot to buy your best friend's sister's brother's girlfriend a gift for Christmas. On Christmas Eve, you ran to Walgreen's and bought a frame, and then put a note on the inside indicating that you'd fill the frame with your awesome Crossroads Christmas portrait. But you checked later, and the portrait wasn't online yet. Your almost-relative is anxiously awaiting this iconic image. Well, don't fret. <strong>Your image will be online very soon.</strong> The elves are working overtime on it, and <strong>we expect to have the images available within the week.</strong> When they're ready, you'll see a banner at the top of this page. And by the way, you look awesome.</p></body></html>
