<p><strong>Wednesday, February 16 </strong><br>A Bigger God</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God stir up an awe and wonder of who you are in my heart.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%20147&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 147</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many times in songs, we exaggerate for the sake of effect. We sing things like, you are better than the best thing of all time or I love you more than my iPhone, but we dont really mean it. (More than my iPhone? Lets not get crazy here.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when it comes to God, there is no exaggeration. All the statements made here in Psalm 147 are 100% true with no embellishment. But is this how we see Him?</p>
<p></p>
<p>How does this song make you feel? Why?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes to read back through this song and pick out a couple of the descriptions that stand out. Then sing (or just say, if you prefer) them to God to tell him what you think of him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT<br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 7" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207&amp;version=NIV">Acts 7</a></p>
