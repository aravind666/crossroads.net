<p><strong>Tuesday, February 9</strong><br>Second Thoughts</p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%204:8-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><br>Galatians 4:8-9</a><br> (Click to view the scripture online.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>When we choose to receive Jesus, sometimes an infusion of excitement follows and things change very quickly. Many things that previously didnt make sense are now clear. Were excited about our new faith. Were telling everyone we know about it. But over time, that excitement can wear off. We realize that our life looks very much the same as before. It can be tempting to return to old patterns and habits, even though we know they arent compatible with our faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>In these verses, Paul expresses his confusion about why the Galatian church has seemingly returned to its previous ways, even though they had a life-changing experience through Jesus. He says their former ways are like chains of slavery and that although theyre comfortable living in familiar patterns, the old ways are harmful and counter to what God desires.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider an old habit or pattern in your life that you know isnt in line with what God desires. Why do you think you still engage with it?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask God to break the habit or pattern you identified and to help you experience freedom in that area, specifically. If you feel prompted by God to take some action in a new direction, take it.</p>
