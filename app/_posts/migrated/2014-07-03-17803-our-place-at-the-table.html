<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Our Place at the Table</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><em>This summer, were revisiting some classic Daily topics. Even if you have a photographic memory, these are worth digesting again. (Also, youre <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/i-developed-what-appears-to-be-a-ph/">probably lying</a>.)</em></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Over the next few weeks, well begin discovering our identities as treasured children of God. Once we know the nature of Gods love, his approval becomes the starting point for our lives--not as the end goal we hope to attain.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:15&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Bible is the story of an adoptive Father fighting to restore his children to their rightful place in the family. Our role in Gods story begins with understanding this love and acceptance--its like God has reserved our place at the most wonderful banquet we can imagine, and all we need to do is accept the invitation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Understanding this concept is one thing; living as if its true can be much tougher. This week, pray for God to reveal areas of your life where youre trying to earn the approval hes already given.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, I want to rest in the love and approval youve so generously given me. Help me to know that I am a loved child of God, and help me to see the areas of my life where I havent yet embraced that fact. Amen.</p>
