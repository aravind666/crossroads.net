<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Appetites: Everything We Need</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were continuing to discover our identities as treasured children of God. Well be looking at how our desire to be loved can create unhealthy appetites in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, help me to see my true identity in you. And help me to walk away from anything that falsely promises to satisfy my existence apart from you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20peter%201:3-4&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">2 Peter 1:3-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Simply put, God gives us everything we need. And the more we lean into Him, the less of an appetite we have for the distractions that we may have used to take Gods place in the past.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Refer back to last weeks <a href="/index.php?action=viewpage&amp;filepath=pages/my/grow//orphanVsChild.htm">Orphan vs. Child chart</a>, and think about the orphan tendency that resonated the most with you. Ask God to make you aware of any actions or habits that have come as a result of that tendency, and ask for his power to break that pattern and enable you to lean into his love more fully.</p>
