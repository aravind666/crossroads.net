<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is a Trailblazer</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will consider what it means for the New Man to have a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to give you a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk+2%3A2-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Habakkuk 2:2-3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Some of the worlds most successful organizations have a vision: a vision to sell products, a vision to help those in need, or a vision to positively impact a world we dont yet know. For most of these organizations, setting a vision helps remind them where they are going. Its no different for the New Man. Hes got a vision and runs after it. Its not an easy thing to do---there are definitely bumps in the road---but to have a vision means to blaze a trail to a place you havent been before.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What do you want your vision to be? It can be specific to your work and family, or maybe its a specific theme of The New Man series. Write it down and put it in a place where you will see it.</p>
