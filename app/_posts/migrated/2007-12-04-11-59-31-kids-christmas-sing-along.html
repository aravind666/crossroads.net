He&rsquo;ll play holiday favorites and a few family-friendly originals, and share stories with the little ones. Of course, it's FREE as part of 3500 Open programming. And there's lots more happening around here. Find out more about <a href="../my/about/buildingUse.php" title="3500 Open">other ongoing events</a> at 3500 Open.
