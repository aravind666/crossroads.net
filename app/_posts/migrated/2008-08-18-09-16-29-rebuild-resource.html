<img src="../images/uploadedImages/Visioneering_1.jpg" alt="Visioneering" hspace="10" width="100" height="141" align="left" />A few years ago I picked up a copy of Andy Stanley's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visioneering-Blueprint-Developing-Maintaining-Vision/dp/159052456X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219064741&amp;sr=8-1">Visioneering</a>. (Andy Stanley is the lead pastor at <a href="http://www.northpoint.org/">Northpoint Church</a> near Atlanta.) The book is rooted in the story of Nehemiah and discusses how to uncover and pursue a personal vision. <br />For anyone wanting to stay tuned to what God's saying and act on it, it's a pretty good read and it's great supplemental material to our current <strong>Rebuild</strong> series.
