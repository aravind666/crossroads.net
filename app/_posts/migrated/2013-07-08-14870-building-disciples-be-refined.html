<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Disciples: Be Refined</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish up this week by focusing on verses 20-23.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:13-23&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16:13-23</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus does not hesitate to rebuke and train Peter when he goes off course. In this moment, Jesus parents Peter and teaches him how to be a good disciple. To push ourselves to grow we must allow people in our own lives to do this. If we want to be all in with God, we have to embrace being refined.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God how you can be more refined by him and who in your life he wants you to be refined by.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Are there people in your life who you allow to redirect you if you go off course? If not, do you have anyone in mind that you should pursue for that?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Now knowing that you are a part of a bigger family and given a new identity in Christ, how does that change your view of the Kingdom?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What are ways that you can reciprocate the trust that God gives us?</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 12</a></p>
