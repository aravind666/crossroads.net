<p>Put Down Your Arms</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, show me where I am fighting for personal control and relegating you to the sidelines.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%204:1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 4:1-3</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It doesnt take a global conflict to see that in some way, we are all running around with our own banners held high, like one-man armies constantly warring for control over what we think is rightly ours. In hundreds of small ways each day, we try to assert ourselvesour needs, our desires, our preferencesover those of people around us. Its often a hard thing to notice because its so commonplace. But the effect is typically stress and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If our motives are merely to further our agenda, and if they arent rooted in God and advancing his love, then well continue warring for personal control, and we wont be able to rest and find joy in his abundance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of one person in your life with whom you have conflict. Ask God to reveal to you both his heart for reconciliation and his heart for the other person.</p>
<p></p>
