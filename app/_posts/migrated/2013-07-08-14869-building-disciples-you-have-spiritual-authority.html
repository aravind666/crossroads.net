<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Disciples: You Have Spiritual Authority</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Because God is a good dad, he wants to entrust us with spiritual authority. Today, focus on verse 19.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:13-19&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16:13-19</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">After Jesus gave Peter his new identity, Peter had a great level of spiritual authority. This happens with us, too. Once we are adopted into Gods family, he entrusts us with spiritual authority. God trusts us to discern things that are of (and not of) him. Jesus told Peter, Whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven. This shows how much God wants to be in a trusting relationship with us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a moment to think about how much God trusts us. Are you reciprocating that trust in the same way?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 11</a></p>
