<html><body><p class="noPspace">There will be no regular weekend services the weekends of December 22-23 and December 29-30, so all the volunteers that make the weekends happen around here can spend time with their families. Instead, join us for a special Christmas Eve service on Monday, December 24 at 5pm in Mason and 5:30pm in Florence. Merry Christmas!</p></body></html>
