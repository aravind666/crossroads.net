My Consumed group met for the first time  the other night to start the journey together. It was great to have a real discussion--we'd mostly been just catching up and sharing prayer requests since the holidays.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"> We went through the questions, and it was interesting to me how the question that moved the group the most was about a gift--a handmade (non-cheesy) gift. Someone's generosity with their time in creating the gift was so impactful. Contrast that with the petty things we talked about buying that we later regretted.<br></font></p>
<p><font size="2">And I lost $20. I had cash in my back pocket all day long, but when I got to Starbuck's to meet everyone, it had fallen out. And then I got the question
that asked what would you do if you lost $200 and you'd never find it? Sure, I'd only lost $20, but it was a cool object lesson for me. The answer is that I would spend a minute or two retracing steps to see if I could find it, but that was it. My friend bought me a tea.<br>
<br>At the end of our group, we decided to move our meetings to 3500 Open so that we wouldn't have to buy coffee. Not that it's bad to spend money (it's not), but we thought it would be a good faith effort toward not spending something we didn't need.</font></p>
