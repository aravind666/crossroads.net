<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The Son of Man is a term used in Old Testament prophecies describing the Jewish Messiah, meaning anointed king or savior. Jesus is clarifying that he is the foretold Messiah, translated into Greek as the Christ. Christ-followers believe that Jesus is the freeing King, awaited by the Jewish nation, and still bringing freedom today.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Today, try admitting to God that you dont have it all figured out, and see what happens.</p>
