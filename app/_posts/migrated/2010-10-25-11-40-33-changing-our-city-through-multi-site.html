<p class="noPspace">Changing our City through  Multi-SitesOne of the primary goals of our  multi-site strategy is to invest in lives across the city and reach  people we couldn’t have without expanding. At our Mason campus, we’re  reaching a unique cross-section of folks in northern Cincinnati and  engaging them into hope-filled relationships. One of the best ways to  gauge our overall health is to check our “vital signs."</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Here are some of  the great indicators of Mason’s vitality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>26 at-risk 2nd and 3rd-graders are  improving their reading and math skills while building trusting  relationships with their tutors through Mason Whiz Kids.</li>
<li>71  volunteers provided food in the Mason Schools Breakfast Program for 128  weeks, (feeding approximately 90 kids weekly) last school year, and we’re doing  it again this year.</li>
<li> 50 volunteers (15 from a new partner  church) provided lunch for three weeks to 60 kids in Mason’s English as a  Second Language summer program for the past two summers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">We’ve also  been able to build relationships with other local churches, such as  David Ray of Christ’s Church at Mason, who helped invest in the  breakfast program and is also participating in Whiz Kids at a Mason  school. Quick-hit efforts like the Thanksgiving Food Drive (at or near  100% participation in both 2008 and 2009) and Angel Tree have been  strong, too; but our heart is to add more opportunities for deeper  relationships that yield significant and sustained life change.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">The question  is: “if we care about our city, how do we help improve lives up here?”  The best way I know is to give more of our hearts away. To do this, we  must re-direct our time and priorities. Many believe that suburbanites  have more free time than those from urban areas, but I don’t think  that’s true. Too often, families are way over-committed with work, kids  and their endless activities, church obligations, and civic  responsibilities. Parents are exhausted, often living on the edge,  spreading themselves so thin they can barely make life work.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">These demands  of daily life are hard to sacrifice, and they get in the way of loving our neighbors as ourselves,  which is what Jesus challenges us to do in Mark 12:33. So, we’ve  committed to doing lots of “cardio” up here at Crossroads Mason to improve the condition of our hearts, and we’re excited at how love is  changing our community.    </p>
