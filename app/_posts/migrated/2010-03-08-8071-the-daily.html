<p><strong>Monday, March 8</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>During the Free journey, The Daily will be short and sweet. Well start the week with a heads up about your Free guide or small group, and spend the next few days revisiting important ideas from the weekend message.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Get ready to cut and paste. In our Free guides this week, were going to figure out what would happen if we shed a false belief and backfilled that new space with something a whole lot better. Scissors, optional. Finishing Week Three in your guide before your group meets...nope, not optional.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If youre not in a small group yet, open groups meet onsite in Oakley, Mason and Anderson on Wednesday nights at 7pm. Get the details at <a href="/free">crossroads.net/free</a>.</p>
