<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Spirit: Renewal</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at Gods identity through the Holy Spirit this week.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%203:4-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Titus 3:4-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">One way that we know God loves us is that he sent his son Jesus to model an abundant life for us, to die on the cross for our sins and to resurrect. We get to experience that same rebirth through the Holy Spirit. We dont have to die a horrible death like Christ--he did it for all of us. But we get to experience the best part--resurrection, rebirth and renewal.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you were to offer up your whole life to God (even that thing that just popped into your mind that you are nervous to hand over to God) do you trust that he would make it new?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 7</a></p>
