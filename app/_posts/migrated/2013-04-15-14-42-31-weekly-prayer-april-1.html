<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this week&rsquo;s thoughts.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Today is Easter and that is good news. This is the core of the Gospel, which means good news. Jesus took on our debts and sacrificed his life to set us free. This was and is the ultimate Game Change so we&rsquo;re going to take a break from praying for the Game Change initiatives this week to reflect on the love and grace of Jesus. Tim Keller says, \"All change comes from deepening your understanding of the salvation of Christ and living out the changes that understanding creates in you heart.\" As this week&rsquo;s Game Change prayer exercise, let&rsquo;s do two things.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"><strong>First, let&rsquo;s reflect daily on the salvation of Christ and living out our understanding of the gospel as individuals.</strong>&nbsp;Every morning, ask yourself how your understanding of Christ&rsquo;s salvation impacted your life in the last 24 hours and how it should impact your life for the coming 24 hours.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Second, let&rsquo;s repeat the same exercise for our community.</strong>&nbsp;How is the gospel being lived out in Crossroads as a community? For example, it is 10&#58;30-ish right now on Sunday morning. I&rsquo;m sitting in the downstairs work room waiting on the counting team to arrive. I need to stay in here because the offering from the first three services at Oakley this weekend won&rsquo;t fit into the safe. The offering from the 10am service is sitting on the counter in front of me waiting to be counted. We have had over $100,000 in giving to Compassion International, Cincinnati Pools, and the Strive Preschool initiatives so far just from people giving online alone. We still haven&rsquo;t started counting the offerings from the weekend&rsquo;s services. The gospel of Jesus Christ is alive and active in the Crossroads&rsquo; community today. People in our church respond to vision that is rooted in the gospel. Thank you Jesus.</p>
