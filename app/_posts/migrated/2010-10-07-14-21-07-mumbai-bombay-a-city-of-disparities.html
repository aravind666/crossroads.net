<p class="noPspace"><em>Jamie Elkins, who is from the Crossroads community, is serving as an intern for<a title="International Justice Mission" href=""> International Justice Mission </a>on the ground in Mumbai, India. Here she takes us through a day in the life of a Mumbai resident, and provides context for why we are working to rescue girls in India.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Mumbai. Bombay. Tom-ay-to. Tom-ah-to.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">After living here for 9 months, I’m still not sure what to call it. As confusing as the proper terminology can be, nothing tops the conflicting images flashing by my taxi cab window: Super-rich. Unbelievably poor. Porsche. Ox cart. Gucci. Vegetable seller. Metropolitan. Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">As the cab drives down a main road in a fairly well-off neighborhood, I look up and see the newly constructed, 60-story home of the richest man in the world. From the very same spot, I look across the road and see a family huddled under a poorly constructed tarp, wearing filth stained clothes; the younger children wearing nothing at all.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">The shadows of skyscrapers springing up all over the city cast an ominous shade over the expansive slums that fill in the space between existing structures. It reminds me of another shadow hovering above the city—the dark snare of forced prostitution.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Last year, the Central Bureau of Investigation (Indian FBI) said 1.2 million children had been trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Mumbai, the most populated city in India, is also the largest flesh trade hub in the country. It is difficult to estimate the number of women trapped in forced prostitution throughout this sprawling mega-city, but estimates range from 100,000-150,000. It’s hard to believe that the modern metropolis I call home is also the seedy underbelly of a horrific criminal enterprise; the buying and selling of innocent women and children.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">My cab pulls up to a stoplight, and within 2 seconds, children with dirty faces see my white skin and come running up to the window; begging for food and money. I see a girl who cannot be more than 8 or 9 years old. Her sweet smile reminds me of a young girl I know who was rescued from forced prostitution a few years ago. My heart breaks when I think of her vulnerability; the very thought of her being consumed by the ugly shadow of the sex trade is enough to bring tears to my eyes. I take a deep breath and roll down my window.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">“Hi, sundar laadki…Apka naam kya hai?”  (Hi, beautiful girl…What is your name?), I ask. “Pooja”, she replies, with a big grin.  </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">The only comfort I have in seeing the vast disparities I see is this: My Savior already has Pooja’s name written on the palms of his hands. (<a href="">Isaiah 49:16</a>). His walls are ever before her. He has entrusted me, and you, with the ability to protect those walls—to enforce those walls, to call on his justice if anyone tries to scale those walls and to do so for his glory.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Super-rich. Unbelievably poor. Porsche. Ox cart. Gucci. Vegetable seller. Metropolitan. Middle Ages.  Mumbai is a city of disparities.</p>
