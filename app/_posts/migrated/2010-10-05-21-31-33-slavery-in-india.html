<p class="noPspace">According to Ben Skinner in his book <a href="">A Crime So Monstrous</a>, there are 10 to 20 million slaves in India. That means there are more slaves in India than anywhere else in the world. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">For the past seven years, India has been ranked as a Tier 2 Watch List country in the U.S. State Department’s <a href="">Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report</a>. This means it is not in compliance with Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, that the number of victims of trafficking in the country is staggering, and that the government is not taking appropriate actions to end the problem.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">It is the opinion of the U.S. Government that the Government of India is not doing all it should to eliminate slavery. That said, the U.S. does recognize that India has begun making significant efforts to enforce the <span id="shorten_3" title="already-existing Indian law against"><span id="shorten_4" title="already-existing Indian law against">existing laws against slaver</span></span>y. It’s all about<em> law enforcement.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Yet even with their law enforcement efforts, men, women and children from the lowest socio-economic backgrounds in India are particularly vulnerable to trafficking, whether it’s bonded labor or commercial sexual exploitation. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime recently <a href="">interviewed</a> my good friend from IJM, Saju Mathew. In this interview, he provides a great overview of the problem of bonded labor—Indian men, women and children in debt bondage who are forced to work without pay in brick kilns, rice mills, rock quarries and salt works—and how to combat it. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Here at Crossroads, we’re focused on one specific aspect of the slavery problem: combating sex trafficking of children in India. You can read <a href="">Magala’s story</a> for a glimpse of how we are working to rescue girls and empower them to lead full, healthy lives.</p>
