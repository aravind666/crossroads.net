<p>Please join us this <strong>Wednesday, September 28 at 7pm</strong> for an evening of worship and communion...<strong>in Oakley or in Mason.</strong> For the first time, we&rsquo;re offering Last Wednesday services at both locations, so more people can experience Last Wednesday closer to home. Childcare provided at both sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last Wednesday in Mason will meet at Mason Middle School, and we&rsquo;ll have childcare  available at the school for kids ages 0 years-6th grade. No RSVP necessary. Please park in the lot closest to Mason Montgomery Road.</p>
