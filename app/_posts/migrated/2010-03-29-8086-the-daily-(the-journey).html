<p>Week Six, The Journey</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>During the Free journey, we'll start the week with a heads up about your Free guide or small group, and spend the next few days revisiting important ideas from the weekend message.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When you meet with your small group this week, youll get a chance to decide whats next: whether you want to keep getting together, call it quits, or create a pipeline for staying in touch. So this is a good time to start thinking and praying about what will keep you pursuing the freedom God has for you. Ask God to keep your heart open to what he reveals. </p>
