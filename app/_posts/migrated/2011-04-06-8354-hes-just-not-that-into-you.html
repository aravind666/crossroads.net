<p>Hes Just Not That Into You</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a minute to ask God to help you trust that he is who he says he is, even when it contradicts what you might be feeling.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2010&amp;version=NIV">Daniel 10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Daniel was a poster boy for faithfulness. He survived being taken prisoner, survived death by blazing furnace, and dont forget about the lions den. In the midst of this, Daniel had a steady track record of hearing from the Lord. So it must have been surprising for him to pray, and not hear from the Lord for weeks on end. Daniel was in a bad situation. His home was about to be under siege. He needed help, but instead he felt forsaken. As if the god hed been able to count on for everything else had suddenly cut the lines of communication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weeks later, an angel appears to Daniel to tell him that, yes, the Lord heard Daniel and had sent help immediately. But the help He sent was waylaid for three weeks and it wasnt until the warrior angel Michael stepped in that Daniels help arrived. Read that again, because its crazy. But we shouldnt be surprised. Ephesians 6:12 says that our battle isnt against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces of evil. It doesnt make God less powerful or capable, but it is a reminder that this world is still a battleground, and theres more going on than what we may see right in front of us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If youve ever felt like your prayers were just wasted breath, youre not the only one. So, this week, consider being vulnerable with someone about a time when you felt this way, and then (and this is important) pray together. Ask God to show both of you who he is in the midst of confusion, doubt and loneliness.</p>
