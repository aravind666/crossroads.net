<p>Grace and Truth</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%201:14-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 1:14-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When interacting with others, most of us fall into one of two camps. Some of us are Grace People: we major in compassion and tend to see the good in others, and we have the time for those who need another chance. Others of us are Truth People: we major in passion and tend to see the good in obedience, and we like to help people in their decisions so they dont need a second chance. While we need both kinds of people in our lives, the best counsel for growth comes from people who balance both grace and truth. Jesus was this kind of person--full of grace and full of truth at the same time. He is the perfect coach for our freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Who are the people in your life who offer you a balance of grace and truth? Would anyone say you are this kind of person for them?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Thank Jesus for dealing with you according to grace and truth, and ask him to reproduce this characteristic in your life and relationships.</p>
<p></p>
