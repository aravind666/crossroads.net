<p>When Freedom  Comes</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many people  hear from God through music. Today's edition of The Daily focuses on an original song written for the Free journey by Andrea VonAllmen. In your  time with God today, read Andrea's perspective on what she wrote, and then  follow along with the lyrics while you listen to the song. Ask God to meet you  during this time, and to speak to your heart about the freedom he has in store  for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>From Andrea:</strong></p>
<p>This song  is written from God's perspectives. I say "perspectives" (plural)  because of the different views that God has looking onto our freedom. He sees  the root and source of our bondage. He sees the intention or results of the  bondage itself. He even sees the role the Spirit could play in setting us free.  Simply put, this song is God's heart for his people. My prayer is that God has  somehow infused his power and Spirit into this song, however mysterious that may  be. I pray that freedom is a natural result of listening to this song. Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p><em>When the  freedom comes it will be worth it</em></p>
<p><em>It will  be worth it when it comes to you</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>'Cause you've  got too much on your shoulders,</em></p>
<p><em>too much  in your head, too much in your heart</em></p>
<p><em>that's poisonous</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Root deep  I see things that keep you from seeing me</em></p>
<p><em>My will  be done in everyone</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>'Cause you've  got burdens on your shoulders,</em></p>
<p><em>lies in  your head, pain in your heart that wants you dead</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spirit open  their eyes, open their minds, open their hearts</em></p>
<p><em>help them  know truth from a lie, foe from a friend,</em></p>
<p><em>That I  am for them</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>'Cause I  want freedom on their shoulders</em></p>
<p><em>Peace in  their heads, love in their hearts again<br></em></p>
