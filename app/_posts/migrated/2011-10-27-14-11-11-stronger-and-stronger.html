<p class="noPspace">Day 6</p>
<p class="noPspace">We had a wonderful retreat with the IJM staff. We led a 3 day time with them at a retreat center at a hill station 3 hours outside of Mumbai (without Wifi). We were blown away by the beauty of India in this area. Canyons with cut rock mountains and beautiful formation that would rival anything you see out west in the states, but add in the tropical greenery, some monkeys and some water buffalo. The wind was feiece and fields of grass waved like an ocean.</p>
<p class="noPspace">The Lord was at work not only in the creation, but in the hearts of his front line workers. There was much freedom tasted and experienced by the Mumbai IJM staff. We worshipped, shared testimonies, and led them in understanding their gifts. The field director at this office is only 2 months in his role and the spirit of unity and leadership that he brings is strong.<br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">The main realization that I have had on this trip, my third trip to India, is that we American believers are soft. The daily difficulties of being a Christian in a nation that persecutes Christians, creates such strength in the believers here. They are eager to learn, and grow. They are eager to apply what they learn. There is such a spirit of evangelism that we have seen this time as well. To reach their nation for the Lord. It&rsquo;s contagious.</p>
<p class="noPspace">We set up 5 creative prayer stations for the staff, and they responded to them with much weeping and deep prayer. They also came to us to pray for them and encourage them, and it was humbling to serve them in this way. Their requests were close to the heart of God, not for new things or personal needs, but to reach their nation for Christ, and to understand and see him more.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Their faith has inspired me that upon returning I want to know the Lord more deeply, and walk in obedience in what I learn.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Christine F. and Cameron led deeply connective worship. The staff took up their instruments and taught us Hindi songs as well. The children loved their time with Carrie and Victoria who really brought it. The kids came running to their parents to share what they had learned, done and made. Demian and Christine W. led overall and did teaching along with sharing their testimonies which fostered hope. Christy Brock has served in every area: supporting worship, supplies, set up, and every other detail. She is like the glue that holds it all together. We have taught on spiritual gifts here, and seen so much of the gifts of the IJM team. Just as powerful has been seeing the gifts of the team that came here to serve, and how the Lord has strengthened and multiplied those gifts. In a country with much resistance to faith, it seems that it has made us stronger.</p>
