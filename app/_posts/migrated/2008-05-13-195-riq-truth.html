<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/RIQ_90x90.gif" alt="RIQ" hspace="5" width="90" height="90" align="right">This past weekend we kicked off our new series, <a href="/media/series">RIQ</a> (Relational Intelligence Quotient). Chuck Mingo shared with us how important it is to give <em>and</em> receive truth in our relationships. It was also a great reminder of how important it is for us to have
consistent, significant relationships in our lives. (Many people find
these relationships in small groups. If you'd like to find other people
who are looking to form a small group, you can use our <a href="/my/connect/smallGroups/groups_small_group_search.php">Find A Small Group</a> tool.)<br><br>For those who missed the weekend, you can <a href="/messages/2008-08-31-follow-through.html">listen to the talk</a> or <a href="/messages/2008-08-31-follow-through.html">watch it</a>. Also, here are the weekend's <a href="/messages/2008-08-31-follow-through.html">Study Notes</a> and <a href="/messages/2008-08-31-follow-through.html">Program</a>.<br><br>This weekend Brian Tome will be discussing the role of sumbission in our relationships.</body></html>
