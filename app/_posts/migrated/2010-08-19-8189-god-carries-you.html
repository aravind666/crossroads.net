<p>God Carries You</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to show you how he faithfully carries you through lifes trails.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2046&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 46</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>I carried you since before you were born, and I will be your God until your hair is white with age. With these words, God is telling Israel that before they were born until after they are dead, he will carry them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What makes this truly amazing is that He promises this to a group of people who are oppressed, downtrodden and far from their home. Nothing about their current situation suggested that God was even remotely interested in their wellbeing. And in the end, He comes through, delivering them to a new promised land.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In moments of suffering, it can be easy for us to feel distant and disconnected from God; yet this promise holds true for us as wellfrom before we are born until after we die, God promises that he will carry us.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this promise make you feel?</li>
<li>In what ways have you seen God fulfill this promise? In what ways are you still waiting on it?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When we are in the midst of hard times, these kinds of promises run directly against what we are experiencing. Take a few minutes and ask God to help you see his promises as clearly as you see your suffering, and to trust that he will follow through.</p>
