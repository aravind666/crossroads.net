<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">At first glance, this verse can be confusing. How can I be joyful if Im facing trials? God tells us that when were in the midst of something awful we should rejoice. It means were leaning into Him and our faith is working. We usually think were happy only when things are going the way we want them to. But we have the greatest chance at joy and happiness when we see it as an opportunity to grow. Thats why joy is a process.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve all got trouble, big and small. No matter what youre facing---job loss, sickness, or a broken heart---choose to be joyful today. If that sounds hard, ask God to help you do it.</p>
