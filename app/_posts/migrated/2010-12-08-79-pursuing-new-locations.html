<p class="noPspace">Because of the incredible generosity our community has shown through Game Change commitments of over $47 million over the next three years, were pressing the go button on all four campaign initiatives, which means <strong>were actively pursuing strategic locations for Crossroads next sites.</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">The commercial real estate market is complicated, and so <strong>we wont be able to announce which location is next until weve already inked the deal.</strong> But rest assured that were investigating many opportunities for a new location in Greater Cincinnati. As soon as were able to reveal the location of the next site, we will do so!</p>
