You can get involved in the fight for justice by <a href="/messages/2010-08-15-faithful-god.html" title="Justice Serving Opportunities">joining a team</a>, or <a href="/messages/2010-08-15-faithful-god.html" title="E-mail form">signing up for e-mail updates</a> about Crossroads' justice work. <strong>Note: there was a glitch in the e-mail subscribe link (now fixed), and some people who tried to sign up this weekend were not subscribed. </strong>If you don't see "Justice" under My Groups on your My Crossroads homepage, you need to sign up again. You should receive an e-mail confirmation after subscribing.</p></body></html>
