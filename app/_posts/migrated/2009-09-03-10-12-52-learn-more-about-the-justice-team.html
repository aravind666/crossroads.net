This past weekend, Brian Tome and Todd Bretz shared some of what's happening through the work of Crossroads' Justice Team <a href="../../my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=932" title="View Weekend Video">[view weekend video]</a>. You can get involved in the fight for justice by <a href="../../my/serve/reachout/justice/justiceservingops.htm" title="Justice Serving Opportunities">joining a team</a>, or <a href="../my/serve/signUp.php?form=justice" title="E-mail form">signing up for e-mail updates</a> about Crossroads' justice work. <strong>Note: there was a glitch in the e-mail subscribe link (now fixed), and some people who tried to sign up this weekend were not subscribed. </strong>If you don't see &quot;Justice&quot; under My Groups on your My Crossroads homepage, you need to sign up again. You should receive an e-mail confirmation after subscribing.
