<p>God is Light (Part 2)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to show how light is revealed in our lives.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Samuel%2022:29&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Samuel 22:29</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>What is darkness? Think about it a moment before you read on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In reality, darkness is the absence of light. We have flashlights that shoot beams of light, but there is no such thing as a flashdark that shoots beams of darkness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Light is the reality: the dominant factor. Its not possible to have a speck of dark in a lit room, but a single small light will pierce darkness.</p>
<ul>
<li>What comes to mind when you think about light and dark as it relates to your spiritual journey?</li>
<li>What is the most comforting thought or insight you have found as it relates to light and darkness?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Since weve been exploring in more detail the reality that God is light, we will naturally become more aware of light and darkness around us. Ask God to bring true light to your eyes. He will reveal himself in very unique ways.</p>
