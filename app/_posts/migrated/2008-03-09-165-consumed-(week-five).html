our 2008 "all church journey" is now in week five. This past weekend, <a href="http://www.ijm.org/whoweare/garyhaugen">Gary Haugen</a> spoke to us about how prayer has been the foundation of the work of <a href="http://www.ijm.org">International Justice Mission</a>. We were also challenged to make prayer a part of our lives.<br><br>As always, if you missed the service you can <a href="/messages/2008-07-20-week-three.html">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">watch it</a><a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">.</a><a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html"> </a><br><br><strong>Also, don't miss the Prayer Experience that's happening all week. </strong>It is designed to be a simple, personal prayer journey with an audio guide to help you engage with God. It's great for those who have never prayed or for those who pray everyday. The experience is designed to last about an hour, but you can take as much time as you'd like.<br><br><strong>Prayer Experience Times:</strong><br>Sunday, March 9th:  2:00-8:30pm<br>Monday, March 10th-Thursday, March 13th: 7:30am-8:30pm<br>Friday, March 14th 6:30am-8:30pm<br>Saturday, March 15th: 7:30am-2pm<br><br><strong>Childcare will be provided:</strong><br>Tuesday, March 11th 5:30-9pm <br>Wednesday, March 12th, 5:30-9pm<br>Saturday, March 15th 9am-1pm<br><br>If you didn't get one last weekend, you can also <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">download the Consumed Guide</a> (as a PDF), and find a <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">Consumed group</a>. (<em>Note: Study Notes will be suspended for the Consumed Journey because we're all working through the Consumed Guides.</em>)<br><br>Feel free to share any thoughts or reactions to the weekend in the comments.        </body></html>
