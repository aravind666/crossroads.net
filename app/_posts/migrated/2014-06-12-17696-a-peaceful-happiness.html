<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>A Peaceful Happiness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were diving into a new series all about the meaning of happiness, wealth, family and love. This week well explore what happiness means to us, no matter who we are or what weve been through.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to increase your trust in him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15%3A13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 15:13</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56%3A9&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Psalm 56:9</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We really want to control our own happiness. Some of it is up to us---we do have free will, after all. But when we try to control our happiness by what we can do or buy, we can set ourselves up for disappointment or failure. When that happens, we realize that we are actually unhappy and not in control at all.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The only way we will find true happiness and joy is to trust that God loves us and he is on our side. When we choose to believe that, we wont only know joy, but the peace that only God can give.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, give up your control over something and trust that God will give you joy and peace. That means letting a co-worker lead the meeting or asking the kids what to eat for dinner. Whatever it is for you, give up control.</p>
