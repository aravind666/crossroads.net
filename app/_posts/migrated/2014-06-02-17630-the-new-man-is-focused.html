<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is Focused</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will consider what it means for the New Man to have a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you focus your actions toward a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+1%3A1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 1:1-3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Having a vision, no matter how big or small it is, requires focus. If youre cooking a new recipe, you dont ignore ingredients or steps, you focus on cooking a great meal. When you plan to buy a car, you focus on saving money. Thats how God wants us to think about our vision. He wants us to work at it and pay attention to how we can see that vision become a reality. Some will take more time than others, but when we spend time with Him and focus on whats in front of us, great things happen.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our vision can be for today or ten years from now. Do one thing today that will help you focus on whats in front of you.</p>
