<html><body><p class="noPspace">The building in Oakley is closed and there will be no 3500 Open, now through January 13. (Regular hours will resume on Monday, January 14.) There will also be no regular weekend services this weekend (December 15-16) in Oakley only, due to the Awaited show. There will be no regular weekend services at any site, December 22-23 and December 29-30, so that staff and all the volunteers that make Crossroads happen each weekend can spend time with their families. Regular weekend services resume at all sites January 5-6.</p></body></html>
