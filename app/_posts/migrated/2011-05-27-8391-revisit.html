<p><strong>Friday, May 27 </strong><br>Revisit</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thanks for never giving up on me. Thank you that your mercy is new today and will be new tomorrow.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Jonah%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Jonah 3</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Theres so much more to Jonahs story. After hes thrown over a ship and left to drown, God sends a whale to swallow him. Hes safe (but smelly) inside the fish for three days until hes vomited onto the shore. There, God tells him to go to Ninevah (again). This time, he does it. He stops, changes, and follows God. Then once he gets to Nineveh, he leads those people into doing the same thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Repentance doesnt need to be a big, fish-swallowing event. Heres what someone has to say about repentance:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want repentance to be a daily exercise for me. I ache to see it as something woven into the fabric of my relationship with Christ. I want it to be a sustainable habit. I understand Im in progress. That shouldnt surprise me.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to help you take another step toward Him.</p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2027&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 27</a></p>
