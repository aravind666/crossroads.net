<p class="noPspace"><em style="line-height: 1.75;">Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this week’s thoughts.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">Ever wonder if our efforts make a difference? Last Monday, two Thanksgiving Food Drive containers arrived at our partners in South Africa, Grace Bible Church and the Topsy Foundation. This is after almost four months of battles with customs and government agencies to release the goods. Of course, there are months of planning and organization that go into the Thanksgiving Food Drive itself, including seemingly minor details like having kids in Kids’ Club and elsewhere decorating the boxes as a teaching tool. Seems like a lot of work. Is it really worth it?</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Read these two notes. The first is by Rob Seddon and the second is from Topsy. Then, take a look at the included photos. (If you don’t have tears coming out of your eyes, check your pulse.)</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>From Rob Seddon:</strong> <em>Right now, a Crossroads dental team is in South Africa to work with Topsy. One of their stops will assuredly be a small daycare for disabled children that previous teams have visited. This is a one-room building the middle of a shack community ravaged by AIDS, TB and unemployment, so these kids are not exactly at the top of the priority list for care. The people in this facility are what stand between the kids and almost total abandonment. Last month, another CR team visited this facility. As we held the kids, we noticed a table in the corner where they keep most of their office supplies. On the table sat a box of paperwork. On the box was a sticker that read: “Peanut Butter.” This was one of last year’s TFD food boxes, still being put to good use. They use this food, and the boxes it comes in!</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">From Topsy Foundation:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Here are the first pics of the Crossroads food container which arrived at Topsy today. We gave each of the helpers of the day a food parcel to say thank you.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I’ve got one special request. You will see that I took pics of decorated boxes we received in between all the hundreds of boxes. Will you please see that these get to Rob first. My reason for this is, that it is so clear that little children were involved in this process. We need to thank them, show them that their handiwork is here in South Africa and that we appreciate it so much. Hopefully this will contribute to  their parents’ effort who want to teach them to care, not to live for themselves, and make the world a better place. This was for me the highlight of the day!!! The surprise every here and there………….I just loved it. COLOUR!!!!!!!</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I will send the pics of the groups later. The people are over the moon. They are so so so so thankful and excited—I wish you can share the moments they received the food with us. Something special and a humbling experience.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Food parcel love</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Heleen  (Topsy)</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Please pray for our ministry in South Africa to flourish. Pray for our partners Grace Bible Church and Topsy. Pray that HIV/AIDS is eradicated. Pray for generational poverty and segregation in South Africa to be overwhelmed by the love of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
