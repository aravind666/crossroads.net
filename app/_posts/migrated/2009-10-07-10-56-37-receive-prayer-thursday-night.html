If you're processing something for which you'd like to receive prayer, you're invited to sign up for a 45-minute session of reflective listening and focused prayer, during which two trained members of our Prayer Team wil listen to you describe the need you have and then pray for you, with you. Please<a href="../mysend/135" title="Email Prayer"> e-mail us </a>to make an appointment for an upcoming Thursday night slot, and please include your phone number.<br /> <!--EndFragment-->
