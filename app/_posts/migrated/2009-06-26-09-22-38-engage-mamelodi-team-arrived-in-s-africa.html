Our<strong> Engage Mamelodi </strong>team of Will and Beth Skillman and Jason Singh arrived safely in South Africa this week. After a delayed departure in Cincinnati and a full-out sprint to make the connection in Atlanta, everyone (and their luggage) arrived safely on Tuesday. They now begin the task of establishing life there: renting a home, purchasing a car, establishing bank accounts, negotiating cell phone plans, etc. The Skillmans' daughter, Carolina, even has an upcoming school entrance exam.<br /><br />Shortly after they settle in, the group will be participating in GO Namibia, a service trip taking place in July led by a team from Charity &amp; Faith.
