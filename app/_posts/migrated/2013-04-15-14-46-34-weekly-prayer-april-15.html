<p class="noPspace"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this week&rsquo;s thoughts.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">This weekend, Brian suggested that if every person at Crossroads engaged every week like they did during the Rice &amp; Beans fast, we would, amongst other things, be able to build another CityLink Center every year.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak">First, a few stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 25% of Cincinnati live their life below the poverty line. This is twice the national rate.</li>
<li>317,000 adults and 167,000 children live below the poverty line in greater Cincinnati.</li>
<li>80% of those in poverty live in single parent homes.</li>
<li>98% of the poor in Cincinnati were unemployed or part-time and underemployed last year.</li>
<li>A single parent can work 40 hours per week, 52 weeks out of the year, and still be below the poverty line.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">There is a huge need for a ministry that addresses the working poor in Cincinnati. CityLink is making progress already. Last Friday alone, the following happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 50-something client rode a bus from Roselawn to CityLink to take advantage of the services available to her. She missed the bus home. She missed it because she was the first person to receive a car from Changing Gears and drove her very own car home!</li>
<li>On last Friday alone, six CityLink clients rang the bell signifying they got jobs! There are six fewer among those unemployed in Cincinnati and are now working at places like Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Great American Ball Park, Lowes, and other businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">God is blessing the work being done by faithful people at CityLink. It is hard work. Pray for them this week that God will multiply their efforts. Pray for those in poverty in Cincinnati. They need our prayers. Pray for resources and opportunities for people struggling to provide the basic necessities for their families.</p>
