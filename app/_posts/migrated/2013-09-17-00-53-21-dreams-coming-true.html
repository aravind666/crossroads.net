<p class="noPspace">This summer, many young women in Mumbai received the good news that they passed their exams, one young woman had an interview at a call center and better yet, all the young women in Crossroads-supported group homes began voluntarily attending worship services with the church community dedicated to their freedom and restoration!</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">What’s more, one of the young women just celebrated her wedding and has successfully reintegrated into the life she’s always dreamed of. Here’s her story.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Just a few years ago, getting married was probably the furthest thing from Stuti’s* mind.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">A survivor of trafficking, Stuti spent her teenaged years in an aftercare home. Although she was safe, receiving counseling, getting an education and regaining self-worth, society still considered her used goods; marriage was not a likely possibility.  </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Enter Biju.* Growing up in an orphanage, he too wondered if a family was in his future. Two years ago, Stuti and Biju met at the wedding of a mutual friend. Biju fell for Stuti and, after the wedding, even asked her to marry him. Stuti, flattered but determined to finish her studies, replied that she wanted to wait. Biju agreed.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">After Stuti turned 18, she moved into a Crossroads-supported group home operated by the local Indian church. As she continued her healing in this Christ-centered community, she saw families every weekend at church; husbands who loved their wives and wives who were encouraging and supportive to their husbands. These families saw her as a young, beautiful single woman—one worthy of love and a family of her own.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Once Biju finished school and got a job, the two began to talk about marriage again. Stuti told the key adults in her life (including the staff at her former aftercare home and group home, and her pastor) about the proposal. So, like good parents, they sat down with Biju to learn more about his intent to marry their “daughter.” Biju must have made a good impression. They gave their blessing, Stuti accepted Biju’s proposal, and the two began premarital counseling with Stuti’s pastor and his wife, one of the group home administrators.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In June, the couple got married in a beautiful ceremony, accompanied by the pastor and his wife who stood in as Stuti’s parents. Game Change partner staff, housemothers, and group home residents joined for a separate celebration a few days later. Stuti shared that she had dreamed of her wedding for a long time, and it felt like she had family around her to support her and celebrate with her.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Everyone was overjoyed to see Stuti find love and restoration in marriage. “This is what we’ve been working for,” Abhishek, one of the partner staff members, said after the celebration. “To see a girl truly reintegrated into society and healed. We saw that today.”</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Game Change Project Director Cheryl Miyamasu was at the celebration and left with resolve to continue the important work being done in India. “The image of Stuti’s smile as she stood next to her new husband will be etched in my mind forever,” she recalled. “This event was truly a gift from God—a remnant of hope for us, a stake in the ground and a true picture of what hope and joy can come from the work of investing in healing and transformation of these precious girls.”</p>
