<p><strong>Monday, January 25 </strong><br>Rescued<br><br>Today begins a new series based on some themes from the book of Galatians, a letter written by the Apostle Paul to the early Church in the Roman province of Galatia.<br><em><br>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Galatians 1:3-5<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Gods will for our life is that we would be rescuedrescued from the burden of our mistakes, rescued from feeling hopeless or empty, and rescued from anything that separates us from a life-giving and freedom-filled relationship with him. <br><br>Paul says Gods desire for our freedom runs so deep that he allowed his son, Jesus, to suffer and die so that we could be rescued. Because as much as we might believe in our own strength and talents, we cant rescue ourselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a time when you tried to rescue yourself from some struggle or challenge in your life, without help from God or the community of people around you. How did that play out?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Rescue seems to be one of those things that we need on a continual basis. Theres always some adversity to overcome or some situation to grow through. Identify one challenge in your life right now that you cant muscle through with your own strength. Write it down, share it with God, and ask him to set you free. <br><br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Romans 5:6-8</p>
