<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Kingdom Come: Abby</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Heres a story from Abby. She fought for the Kingdom by obeying and experienced her Dads divine power.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>ABBYS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">I lied a lot to my parents, to friends, teachers, to anyone who would listen. All to gain acceptance and attention. I knew it was wrong and that God had better for me, but it was hard for me to break the pattern. My friends eventually moved onto healthier friendships. I was left bitter, resentful and abandoned.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Six years later, I occasionally get small flashbacks to the person I was and the people I hurt. Every time I have thought about apologizing I have chickened out, too proud and afraid of being vulnerable. Last week, I received the challenge during small group to ask God to change my way of thinking about a specific action or behavior. The world tells me to move on, to let go of what I did and to never to put myself in a vulnerable position. The Kingdom tells me to obey, to humble myself and ask for forgiveness. God was telling me it was time to apologize. After a week of struggling about why I did not want to do it and why it was not a good idea---I did it.</p>

<p class="noPspace">I wrote two old friends who I had lied to and betrayed countless times. I apologized, admitted I lied to them, was selfish and full of seeking attention. I sent both messages and I felt terrified. What if they bring up all the awful things I did and said? What if they dont forgive me and tell me what a horrible person I am?</p>

<p class="noPspace">I took my fear to the Lord and felt the weight I had been carrying lifted off. I heard Him tell me, "You obeyed, you stepped out and trusted me. Now trust me to take your fears." So I handed over my fears of being vulnerable and I have never felt more freedom. A weight has been lifted all from obeying. Freedom is found in obeying.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>

When Abby obeyed her Dad, she had the power to fight her pride and experienced freedom from her fear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, did someone in your own life come to mind? Your Dad might be asking you to connect with that person. Even if you dont know why, take that first step and obey.</p>
