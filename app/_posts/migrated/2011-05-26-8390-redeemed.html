<p><strong>Thursday, May 26 </strong><br>Redeemed</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, show me more of you today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Jonah%201-2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Jonah 1 and 2</a></p>
<p><br><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So what happens when we get this wrong: when we turn away from what we specifically know God wants for us? Well, Jonah ended up vomited out of a whale. (But hes also rescued from drowning at sea by being swallowed by that same fish. And thats not even the end of the story.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you make a mistake, you dont need to sit and stew in it, wait it out, hide, disguise or ignore it. And you definitely dont need to keep it to yourself. Always bring God into it. Theres freedom there.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God for extra chances to turn toward him today. Then take them when they come your way.</p>
<p><br><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT </strong><br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2026&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 26</a></p>
