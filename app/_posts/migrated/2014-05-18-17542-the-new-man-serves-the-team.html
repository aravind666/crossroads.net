<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Serves the Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about how men play on a team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you serve your team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A41-45&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 10:41-45</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we choose to follow Jesus, we make a decision that we want our lives to look like his. That doesnt mean were just nice to people, it actually means we serve them. Thats what Jesus says men do---they put aside their own desires and their own needs and ask the team, What can I do for you? When we give up ourselves for those around us, for those on our team, and serve them, were getting closer to looking like Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about your teams---at home, work, or maybe in your neighborhood. Pick the team that is most important to you. What is one thing you can do to put yourself aside and serve the team? Go do it.</p>
