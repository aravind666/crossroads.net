<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Six months ago, Dave and Cheryl Miyamasu left the comfort of Cincinnati behind to live in a city on the other side of the world. Responding to God&rsquo;s call, they serve as interns with our partners in Mumbai, Crossover Foundation to help survivors of sex trafficking find hope and healing. Here&rsquo;s an update on how they&rsquo;re doing and what God has shown them so far. (To read more about how the Miyamasus ended up there, <a href=\"/blog/view/5/12083\">read our July blog post.</a>)</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;<br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Paint us a picture of what&rsquo;s it like there right now.</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">It&rsquo;s currently winter here in Mumbai, which means it&rsquo;s sunny, dry and gets up to 85 degrees during the day. Today, I (Cheryl ) will be doing a session with young women at the new VIDA holistic care facility Crossover opened in December, providing counseling, education, life skills and job training in one building. And Dave will be conducting a training session with the counselors on a new reporting system he developed. Right now, we can hear the local fish man yelling &ldquo;muchli!&rdquo; as he walks through the streets selling fish he carries in a plastic tub on his head.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>What does day-to-day life look like for you?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">It usually consists of getting up in the morning, eating breakfast, and spending time reading the Bible and in prayer. We arrive at the Crossover office before 9am and the work day staff devotion. I focus on aftercare, such as developing systems and programming for the girls in our group homes. Dave spends his time developing new computer systems for the staff to use, adding new features to the website, or troubleshooting staff IT problems. Our workday ends around 5&#58;30 pm, and we walk home to our flat. Some evenings we head to the gym or we run in the morning before work.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>You&rsquo;ve been in India for six months already. What has it been like so far?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">These past few months have been both incredibly full of blessing and incredibly challenging. It has been so exciting to work at Crossover, helping girls gain healing, restoration, and a new hope and future after being trafficked. Par for the course when moving to a new country, we are also going through cultural adjustment. There are ups and downs to this process. Unspoken cultural rules and expectations require us to be flexible, and we are learning to be observant and patient. We are also learning to rely on the Lord and trust Him in all areas of life. God has been so faithful to us, the Crossover staff has been so warm and welcoming to us, and we have felt so supported and encouraged by friends and family at home.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>What has the biggest surprise been?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Mumbai is a bustling city of 18 million people. We were surprised by endless throngs of people, buildings, vehicles, and animals, and how all of these things can be a constant barrage on your senses. To give a comparison, Cincinnati has an average of 4,000 people per square mile; Mumbai has 54,000 people per square mile. Imagine a Cincinnati home for a family of four housing 54 people instead!</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>What have you discovered about yourselves?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">We are discovering that doing things out of our own strength can only get us so far, and we truly need the Lord in all areas of our lives. We are learning to give things to God in prayer more often than we used to back home. With so many things seemingly out of our control, we have found that instead of freaking out, the first thing to do is to lift up our concerns to God and trust him to show up.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>What has God shown you through your work?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">As with many nonprofit organizations, there is always a lot of work to be done, and sometimes it can feel overwhelming. We are learning the importance of working from a place of rest. We recently took a holiday vacation to Bangalore and Nepal, which gave us time to recuperate, reflect and relax. Since then, we have felt refreshed, full and more prepared to dive back into our work. God is showing us the importance of scheduling time to rest so he can fill us up and refresh us to increase our capacity to give through our work.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>How has it been seeing people from Crossroads come for GO trips?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Whenever a GO trip team comes to Mumbai, they inject so much energy into the Crossover staff. There is a palpable feeling of excitement before their arrival, and we love to see people from home and hear stories of why they&rsquo;ve come to India. Each team has a different objective and focus, all of which are direct blessings to the work Crossover is doing. Seeing our Crossroads community passionately involving themselves in the work here is really encouraging.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>What are your hopes for the months ahead?</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">These past few months have been nothing short of an adventure, and we hope to continue seeking and following the Lord on his adventure for our lives. It&rsquo;s been a journey of constant trust and dependence on Him, and we want to continue to grow closer to him. Specifically, we desire to continue to use our skills to support the Crossover staff, the women receiving help and our church partners. Personally, we are hoping to improve our Hindi, explore new parts of India, run a road race, and continue growing in our marriage together.</p>
