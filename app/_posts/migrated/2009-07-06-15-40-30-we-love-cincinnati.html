<img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/in-love-grab.jpg\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"5\" width=\"208\" height=\"156\" align=\"right\" />There's so much to love about Cincinnati. This past weekend, we kicked off a summer-long series exploring ways that we can love our city. If you missed the service, be sure to <a href=\"../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=898\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"What We Love Video\">watch this video</a> of the many reasons to love Cincinnati. You can even share the love by visiting the <a href=\"http&#58;//www.welovecincinnati.org\" title=\"We Love Cincinnati\">We Love Cincinnati website</a> and by proudly displaying an<strong> I Love Cincinnati</strong> bumper sticker. Still need one? Grab one at the Info Center in Mason or Oakley.
