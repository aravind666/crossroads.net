This past weekend, we kicked off a summer-long series exploring ways that we can love our city. If you missed the service, be sure to <a href="/messages/2010-05-30-get.html" target="_blank" title="What We Love Video">watch this video</a> of the many reasons to love Cincinnati. You can even share the love by visiting the <a href="/messages/2010-05-30-get.html" title="We Love Cincinnati">We Love Cincinnati website</a> and by proudly displaying an<strong> I Love Cincinnati</strong> bumper sticker. Still need one? Grab one at the Info Center in Mason or Oakley.</body></html>
