<p>Faith and Deeds</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, show me what it means to be perfectly aligned in my faith and my actions.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%202:20-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:20-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, was promised a son in extreme old age. After years of waiting, Isaac finally arrived. As you might imagine, Abraham deeply loved his son. But one day God told Abraham that he was to make a sacrificeand Isaac was to be the offering. Confronted with what seemed like an impossible decision, Abraham chose to believe in Gods perfect wisdom, even though it didnt make sense to him. So just as he was told, Abraham climbed to the designated place and just before he was going to take his sons life, one of Gods angels appeared and held his hand away from his son.</p>
<p>Since that time, Abrahams example has existed as the perfect alignment of faith and deeds. By referencing this story, James is again reminding us that true faith and true action are not separate things, but rather two sides of the same thing: a heart fully committed to God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>In our world of caution and safety, radical acts of faith are much more the exception than the rule. Make a list of the people you know (either personally or who youve heard about) who have lived lives that showed radical faith. Make a list of why you couldnt possibly follow their example. Then cross out all those reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Discussion Questions </strong><br><br><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>If theres one message that James wants us to hear loud and clear, its that there is no separation between our words and our actions. While we can pretend for a short while, eventually the true nature of our hearts will show through.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>At least in some small way, we have all lived two lives: the one that we were happy to show to the world, and the one that we hide. Talk about the stress and tension that came (or comes) from trying to live in two different ways.</li>
<li>Ask someone how you can encourage and pray for them in their desire to live one life, fully transparent and devoted to God.</li>
</ul>
