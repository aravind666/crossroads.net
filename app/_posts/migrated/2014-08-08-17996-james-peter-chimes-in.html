<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Peter Chimes In</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As we continue to study the book of James, were focusing on the power of our tongues.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>1 PETER 3:10</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">James wasnt alone with his <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:3-6&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">power-of-tongue message</a>. Yet we see something fresh with Peters words: a straightforward promise of good days when we control what we say (even when were suffering, frustrated, wronged, blamed or entirely at the end of our rope).</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, personalize Peters advice. If you controlled your tongue, what would actually happen? What heated conversations would you avoid? What relationship would be better off? Who would thrive? </p>
