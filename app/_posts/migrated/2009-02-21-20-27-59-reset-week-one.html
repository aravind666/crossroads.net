<a href=\"../reset\"><img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/Reset/Boyd1-1-still.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Boyd\" hspace=\"5\" width=\"150\" height=\"129\" align=\"right\" /></a><strong>Reset</strong>, our 2009 All-Church Journey, is underway. This week we're taking a look at Jesus as a historical figure and being challenged to reset our assumptions about him. Throughout the journey, we will be placing additional resources, extra video segments and more on the Reset home page. These segments will include uncut interview footage discussing that week's topic in-depth.<br /><br />This week's footage includes <strong>Greg Boyd</strong> (Author, Theologian) talking about why he believes in God, <strong>Edwin Yamauchi</strong> (History Professor, Miami University) discussing the writing of the New Testament and <strong>Keith Crutcher</strong> (Neuroscientist) discussing some of his reasons for belief in Jesus.&nbsp; <a href=\"../reset\">Visit The Reset Home Page<br /></a>
