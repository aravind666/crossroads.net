<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Read Sarahs story of seeking the Kingdom in her relationship with her dad.</span></p>


<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>SARAHS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Im a senior in high school and going into this journey I wasnt really sure what to expect. I think the journey really began to become real in week 2. I was listening to the Receive CD in my car, and I kept getting this feeling that if I was going to receive Gods love, I needed to be free of any unloving thoughts I had towards others. This has always been a struggle for me---I am notoriously good at holding grudges especially when it comes to my dad. Ever since my parents divorced, Ive refused to forgive him.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I felt that I really needed to work on forgiving my dad and repairing our relationship. This terrified me. But when my dad picked me up from my moms house that week, I decided I was going to sit in the front seat with him, which I usually refused to do and when he asked how my day was, I was going to give him a concrete answer rather than just saying "fine." So I opened the passenger door, climbed in, and started telling him about my day at school, my classes and music. For the first time in years I actually allowed myself to see the part of my dad that I had been blocking: he is silly, thoughtful and most of all loving. Hes always been the loving dad that I remembered, hes just been waiting patiently for me to let him back in.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">It hasnt been easy, but over these couple of weeks Ive noticed not only a change in my feelings towards him, but a change in him as well. He smiles more around me, and just seems to be in better spirits. Our relationship definitely wont be healed in one week, but Im making progress and I think he knows that. The greatest thing is how much Ive felt Gods presence throughout this struggle. Ive grown more in the Kingdom of Heaven and Ive grown closer to both my dads.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" shape="rect">1 John 5:4</a> we learn that we can overcome the world through faith or seeking the Kingdom of God. Sarah decided to put on her Kingdom goggles and overlook what the world might tell her about her dad: to hold a grudge because he hurt her. When we are faithful and seek the Kingdom our lives and relationships are transformed.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Did a relationship in your own life come to mind while you read? Maybe its a friend, a coworker or your own dad. How might seeking the Kingdom restore that relationship?</p>
