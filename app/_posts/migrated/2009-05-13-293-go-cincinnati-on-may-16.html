<html><body><p>If you were one of the 6,500 people citywide who signed up to volunteer this Saturday for GO Cincinnati, please show up, for the love. You should have received a confirmation e-mail with your project assignment and all the details, including arriving between 7-7:30am, wearing a white t-shirt and coming ready to work, rain or shine. We'll have a kick-off service at 8am, then we'll unleash you to change our city on over 300 projects around the city from 9am-1pm. See you Saturday!</p></body></html>
