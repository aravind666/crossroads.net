<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET SARAH</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"From childhood onward I have sung about Jesus loving me, and have known to take my little light and let it shine. As a baptized-at-birth lifelong Christian, I thought I truly believed in these things as well. While I knew of Jesus truly loving me and knew of the beauty of Gods unconditional love, fear and anxiety often kept me from truly believing these things deep down into my core. This fear, in turn, kept me from experiencing the fullness of Gods love.

For the first time in my entire life I felt a love greater than anything one could experience human to human. I felt completely forgiven, accepted, saved, and celebrated."</p>
