<p class="noPspace">Day 4 in India........was just like the first 3, freakin awesome!</p>

<p class="noPspace">Today we had 23 baptist pastors join us for a pastors conference where we hoped to initiate some relationships with some churches that could come along side of us in our endeavors over here. You wouldnt believe me if I told you how smoothly today went. We worshiped in english, we worshiped in Hindi. We heard testimony from a 75 yr old Indian gentleman who lost all 7 of his children and minutes before his wife passed away......she brought him to Christ. Im pretty sure there wasnt a dry eye in the house. (oh, and that gentleman traveled 8 hrs one way to be with us). We ate meals together, we shared pastoring ideas, and tomorrow we will be heading out in the city to pray with them in their ministry fields.</p>

<p class="noPspace">The 2 events that we hosted (the Kids Camp and the Pastors conference) seriously could not have gone any better than they did. There was most certainly divine presence at both events. And again our group was absolutely phenominal. We held 3 workshops in the afternoon for the pastors (worship, childrens ministry, and pastoral care). Brothers and sisters in Christ spent 3 hours sharing ideas and concepts about ministry.......it was pretty stinkin cool.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Tomorrow starts some more challenging days where well be heading out in the city, well be visiting some balwadis (daycare homes for disadvantaged children) and then well be visiting a couple aftercare homes on Wednesday. These aftercare homes are the focal point of our work here. These homes (and the young women in them) are where God has called our community. As the India initiative moves forward, there will be aftercare homes constructed, and lives restored. Well get to meet firsthand the girls who God has called us to help. I cant believe we actually get to be a part of that.</p>

<p class="noPspace">The next few days will be tiring, but powerful. Well keep you updated!</p>

<p class="noPspace">God Bless,</p>
