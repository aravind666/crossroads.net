<p>No Deal</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please give me strength when I face my own weaknesses.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Matthew 4: 1-11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW%204:%201-11&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 4:1-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus, in a very human way, is tempted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Turn these stones into bread. Its the temptation of physical satisfaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throw yourself from the tower and let God save you. The temptation of fame and glory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kneel down and worship me. The temptation of immediate fulfillment, of having every dream and desire met.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each of these temptations is a question of trust. Will God sustain me? Will I be significant amongst the sea of humanity? Will I accomplish my goals and dreams?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In each instance, Jesus bucks the trend of humanity, doesnt act on the temptation, and chooses to trust Gods plan for him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>They might come in different packaging, but the temptations offered to Jesus are no different from our own. Take a few minutes to identify a temptation you face and which of Jesus temptations it most closely matches. Then memorize His response and make it your own as you face that temptation whenever it comes up.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 14" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2014&amp;version=NIV">Acts: 14</a></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>The people Jesus came to save and live alongside carried a lot of expectations about who he was supposed to be and who they wanted him to be.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think their expectations were so different from what Jesus actually was?</li>
<li>What expectations do you have around your relationship with Jesus right now? Take a few minutes and identify at least two, and try to figure out where those expectations come from.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>As we see the life of Jesus unfold, it can be easy to forget that we can identify with his experiences, since in addition to being God, he was fully human. We looked at the story about Jesus being tempted while in the desert. Now consider this verse from Hebrews 4:15: For we do not have a high priest [Jesus] who is unable to emphasize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we areyet he did not sin.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the phrase tempted in every way and how that could have played out in Jesus career as a carpenter, in his situation as a sibling, or as a member of his community. If you think about temptations in those specific areas, what can you personally identify with?</li>
<li>How does this affect you or make you feel?</li>
</ul>
