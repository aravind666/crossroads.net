<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: The Positive of Suffering</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to prepare you for whatever he wants to teach you today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">James 1:9-11</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 5:3-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">During a time when you were suffering, think about any ways that you shut down, or acted in a way youre not proud of, or turned away from God or other people. What was the effect of your response?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">OK---now think about if anything positive or healing came out of your suffering. That doesnt mean the good outweighs the bad, but it does mean considering how youve grown in your understanding of God, or found new relationships, or saw an unexpected benefit. This is what James wants us to consider.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Share your story of overcoming adversity as an encouragement to someone else. If someone you know needs to hear it, tell them. Its OK if youre not ready to share it, but try writing it as a letter you can revisit later on.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 7</a></p>
