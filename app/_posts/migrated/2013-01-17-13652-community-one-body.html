<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: One Body</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We are continuing to look at community through the lens of Romans 12 this week, a few verses each day.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you started to let God form you yesterday, the next step is to start to look for where your puzzle piece fits in the overall picture. Sometimes, when we let the world have input into our identity, we think we should be good at everything, or believe the lie that we are good at nothing. God has made us all differently, so we have unique things to offer the community (or what Paul so aptly calls the body). We are not all meant to be fingers or kneecaps or armpits. This means that you are needed by the body, your community. It also means that you need others (even kneecaps get itchy sometimes).</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take a moment today to take inventory of some things that you believe you are good at, and some things you regularly struggle with.</p>
