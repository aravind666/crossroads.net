<p><strong>Tuesday, May 10 </strong><br>The Spirit of Love</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to keep your mind and heart open to his teaching.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2013:8-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"> Romans 13:8-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>None of us is capable of giving perfect love. (And although it sounds strange, we even have a hard time receiving it.) But the Holy Spirit is capable of perfect love, and we can both draw from and release incredible amounts of love because of the Spirit. So when our impulse to put someone in his place begins to burn within us, it is the Spirits power that is able to quiet our heart. When we want to cling to our possessions, it is the Spirits power that gives us the ability to generously love others. Or when we feel starved in a marriage, it is the Spirits power that gives us strength to make another sacrificial gesture. </p>

<p>Whats one action you could take to change an unloving behavior or attitude? Ask Gods Spirit to fill you with the love you need to follow through on it.</p>
