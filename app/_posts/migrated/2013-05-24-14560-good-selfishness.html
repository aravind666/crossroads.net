<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good?: Selfishness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Last week we looked at Gods good design and purpose for sex. This week we will look at the difference between going rogue in forming our identity around sexuality or letting the Spirit form and move us.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:16-18&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:16-18</a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are born self-focused and selfish. The human race would die out if we didnt have a desire to generally take care of ourselves and our needs. However, when we apply the same sense of entitlement to sex that we do to food, protection, and basic needs, we can end up lost with a deep dissonance in our soul. God has freedom for you, let his Spirit lead and tell you who you are.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its a good day to listen. Get out your journal and ask God to give you a picture or word for how he sees you. Write it down or draw it.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 2</a></p>
