<p><strong>Week 1: Growing Into Freedom</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, April 11</strong></p>
<p>Growing Into Freedom<strong><br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please show me any areas of my life where I do not fully trust your power and provision.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015:13&amp;version=NLT">Romans 15:13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If you were around Crossroads last spring, you probably remember the journey we did called Free. Lots of orange, kites flying off stage, and intimate stories of people who found freedom from old habits and beliefs by trusting in Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For  the next two weeks, were going to focus on freedom againbecause freedom is something we grow into. Without realizing, we can slip back into unhealthy habits and beliefs when were  not being intentional about fully trusting God and his plan for us. So for a  couple weeks, well get a freedom refresher by looking at how people in the Old Testament put themselves in position to trust God, and thereby experience  freedom. And well consider how we can do that in our own lives. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If you did the Free Journey, think back (or reopen your guide) to the area you focused onwhether that was something related to fear, rejection, bitterness or religion. If you didnt do the journey, think about a place in your life where you feel stuckmaybe an area that doesnt feel in sync with what a loving God would want for you. Then ask God to bring you clarity around that area: how its affecting you right now, how its affecting your relationship with him, and how its affecting the people around you.</p>
