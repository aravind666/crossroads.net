<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Appetites: The Best Invitation Ever</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were looking at how our desire to be loved---if misdirected---can create unhealthy appetites in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, thank you for inviting me to be part of your family. Help me make the time and the space to meet with You.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20peter%201:3-4&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">2 Peter 1:3-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We looked at this passage earlier in the week, but its worth checking out again. God knows that our earthly appetites, when left unchecked, leave us with a sick feeling in our stomachs and an unhealthy desire for more. The Bible promises us again and again that God wants something better for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend a few minutes considering the possibility that God is a loving Father who wants the best for you. How might that affect your life on a daily basis? (And if you havent tried this weeks fasting challenge, maybe give it a shot this weekend.)</p>
