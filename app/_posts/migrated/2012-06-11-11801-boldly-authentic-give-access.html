<p class="noPspace"><strong>Boldly Authentic: Give Access</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week were learning four ways to live boldly authentic lives of faith, based on Jesus example in the book of John.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Back in the day, Jews didnt associate with Samaritans, and rabbis definitely didnt associate with "women of ill repute" like this. But Jesus generously gave this woman access to his time and attention, and was able to share Gods truth with her in a way shed never heard before. Bold authenticity has the power to deepen relationships, making room for powerful conversations.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Today, give someone greater access into your life. Invite a friend on an errand, have your kid help with dinner, bring a co-worker in on a project. As you do this, consider how this everyday interaction influences that relationship.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
