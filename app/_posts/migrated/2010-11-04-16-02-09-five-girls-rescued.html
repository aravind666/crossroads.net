<p class="noPspace">Last Friday,  with the cooperation of the local police, our partner <a title="IJM website" href="http://www.ijm.org">International Justice Mission</a> rescued five girls from  of a brothel in Mumbai. Trafficked from other parts of India, these girls lived in a filthy 64-square foot room and  forced to have sex with numerous clients every day for as little as $3 per client (their .   Some of these girls did not see sunlight for as long as seven years!</p>

<p class="noPspace">Today, the  survivors are at a government aftercare home with a hope for restoration.  A  critical piece of the Game Change strategy for India is to improve the quality of care that  rescued girls will receive in aftercare, including government homes where girls  first go when they are rescued. IJM partners with  aftercare homes who are doing the best they can with their limited resources. Through Game Change, we can bolster the efforts of aftercare homes so these girls can physically heal,  receive proper therapy to restore their sense of self, gain academic and vocational  skills that will allow them to thrive economically, and integrate into a loving  church community. </p>
