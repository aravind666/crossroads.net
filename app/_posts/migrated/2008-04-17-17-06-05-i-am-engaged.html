<img src="../../images/uploadedImages/iam90x90_1.jpg" alt="I AM" hspace="10" width="90" height="90" align="right" />We're in week two of&nbsp;  &quot;<a href="../my/media/messages.php">I AM...</a>&quot; In this series, we're examining the life of Jesus and seeing what it looks like
to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we
saw that Jesus was engaged with the culture around him and how we are also called to engage right where we are. <br /><br />In case you missed the service, you can <a href="../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=581">watch</a> (including the Bono video) or <a href="../my/media/playMedia.php?idMedia=580">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href="../images/uploadedImages/StudyNotes4.13.08.pdf">Study Notes</a> (PDF).<br /><br />This coming weekend, Brian Tome will be talking about how Jesus was surrendered to his mission.
