<p>A Good House</p>
<p><br><em>God, bring me a new understanding of your power and how it will bring me to a more peaceful place. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%209:10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 9:10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>One of the fundamental rules in buying a house is to make sure that the foundation is solid, right? After all, it doesnt matter nearly as much how many closets it has or if the shingles need replaced. If the foundation is broken or unstable, that house is headed for trouble. In this proverb, Solomon says that the foundation, the basic support and resting place, for wisdom is in the fear of God. Knowing God--his power, his character, his actions--causes us to make better, wiser, calmer decisions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes and ask God to show you what fear of him means for you. Ask Him to help you understand how it can bring you peace and freedom from worry.</p>
