and we still need lots of small group hosts. If

The commitment is for only six weeks, and you don’t have to be a Bible expert or trained facilitator to host. <strong>We’ll give you everything you’ll need.</strong> This journey will be a life-changing (and fun) opportunity that you really don’t want to miss.<br><br><a href="/" title="Consumed">Learn more</a> about the Consumed journey, or <a href="/" title="Sign Up To Host">sign up to host</a> now.<br>
