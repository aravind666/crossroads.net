<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are continuing to look at a longer passage in Luke 12, a few verses at a time.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:27-28&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Luke 12:27-28</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday we were told to look at the ravens. Today, Look at the lilies. If you are struggling to hear Gods voice, it might be be time to step outside. Do you believe that God is holding out on you, that he has only given you the content of your apartment, room, or home? God offers you the grandeur of all of creation, and it reflects the artist who created it all. The Artist loves color and cares for every creature. He invests beauty and care into each creation. God has invested so much into our personhood. We are the high point of creation, and you can be sure that God is eager to care for his investment.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Catch yourself in comparison today. If you are spending time noticing what others are wearing, eating, owning, or experiencing. Take those moments and remember all the beauty of nature God has already given you. If you have a moment of comparison, turn it into gratitude.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
