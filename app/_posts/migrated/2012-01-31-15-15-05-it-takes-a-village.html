<p class=\"noPspace\">The African proverb &ldquo;Oran a azu nwa&rdquo; tells us &ldquo;it takes a village to raise a child.&rdquo; Through our partnerships with Crossover Foundation, IJM, local churches and social enterprise NGOs, we have been fighting to assure safe and secure surroundings for rescued survivors to be renewed, restored and reintegrated into society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">While these are the foundations of our hands-on ministry in India, there is a &ldquo;village&rdquo; in Cincinnati that has directly affected the lives of these girls and young women as well. Actually, there are a number of them.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Crossroads has dozens of volunteers responding to God&rsquo;s desires for justice and restoration for sex-trafficking survivors in India. These volunteers contribute different skills (e.g., business, creative, technical, admin) and come from a variety of backgrounds&mdash;working together to make a difference in the lives of these girls and young women. These volunteers form groups of 10-30 people (called &ldquo;Villages&rdquo;) to work and serve in community. The mission of the Villages is &ldquo;to engage in work that is vital for our justice efforts, while praying, learning and growing.&rdquo; Each Village has projects related to the mission and action plans developed by Crossroads for India. &ldquo;We have one thing in common,&rdquo; said Terri Elmore about the volunteers of the Prayer Village. &ldquo;We love God, we&rsquo;re passionate about stopping trafficking in India, and we believe in the awesome power of God to change things on earth through our fervent prayers.&rdquo; That is evident by the number of praise reports the Prayer Village volunteers receive each week along with prayer requests from our boots on the ground&mdash;from successful IJM rescues and perpetrator convictions, to successful partnerships with churches eager to start transition homes.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">While some projects require the efforts of a village, others only require one person. An example is Gloria Sigman, one of our first Justice volunteers. In March 2011, when Crossover Foundation was considering a partnership with the Maharashtra Baptist Society (MBS), Gloria was asked to investigate everything she could about them to help inform the decision. For three days, Gloria researched MBS online and then sent a five-page report back to her Village Leader Linda Averbeck. In April, Crossroads Justice Director Don Gerred announced that, thanks in part to her research and the prayers of many, Crossover founder and CEO Keith Dsouza had successful discussions with Pastor Vivian Fernandes of MBS, and had already identified a property as a potential aftercare home site. &ldquo;When I heard that, I was somewhat overwhelmed. Not having a job at the time, I felt that my time could have been better spent looking for a job. But when I heard that MBS had become a partner, I knew that project was something God had put on my plate,&rdquo; said Sigman. &ldquo;Having been a trial attorney for 20 years, I was used to being in the limelight. I believe God brought this work to me so I could understand I could be just as integral a part doing something behind the scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Gloria&rsquo;s is just one of the many contributions the Villages have made in our justice efforts. On January 18, a team of over 15 village volunteers hosted a prayer gathering at Crossroads&ndash;a time for those involved or interested in the Justice ministry to reflect and pray for the work we have been called to do in India. Participants prayed for our India partners, read stories about rescued trafficking survivors, wrote encouraging notes to our partners, and painted messages on canvases for aftercare homes. It was a tremendous event&ndash;the effects of which will undoubtedly be revealed soon enough!</p>
