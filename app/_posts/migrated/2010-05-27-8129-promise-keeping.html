<p>Promise-Keeping</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%20145:13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 145:13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Both the Old Testament and New Testament testify to God being our promise keeper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God never once failed the Israelites who wandered, homeless, for 40 years. He provided for all their needs as He promised. And when God promised us that he would send someone to save us from our sins and the pain of this world, He did. He sent Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We hear a lot of I promise in our lives. Some of these promises fall through the cracks because none of us are perfect, and intentions arent always met with follow-up action. But Gods track record is perfect. He promises; he delivers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever felt God promised you something and delivered on it? What promises has God given to you that you are still waiting for?</p>
<p></p>
