<p class="noPspace"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this week’s thoughts.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">We received good news this week! We are opening our seventh aftercare home in India and six girls have been identified and approved to come to the home. These girls will arrive at the home on Jun 7th.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Want confirmation that these homes make a difference. Read the report jointly written by one of the directors of the homes and Crossroads’ very own Cheryl Miyamasu:</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>This past Sunday was Sarita’s* birthday (*name changed to protect identity). Sarita has been living in a Crossover Foundation group home for about a month.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>On the morning of her birthday, the girls from the home, the housemothers, and I went to church at the Free Methodist Church (FMC), our church partner for this home. After the service was finished, the church members sang a birthday song for Sarita.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I had planned a birthday celebration for Sarita at the group home for the evening. A couple from the FMC church, Brian and Renu Michael, asked if they could join us for the birthday celebration. With my permission, they joined us at the home in the evening for Sarita’s celebration. When they arrived, Ranu gave Sarita a carrot cake that she had made herself.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>The evening celebration began by singing some worship songs followed by the official birthday cake-cutting. Renu shared encouraging words from the Bible for Sarita and the rest of the girls. The other girls in the house each presented Sarita with a gift, and one by one, they gave a special birthday word of encouragement to Sarita.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>At the end of the celebration, Sarita said she wanted to share something with the group. With all eyes on her, Sarita said, “I never used to be happy on my birthday. I would spend the whole day crying. Even with I lived with my aunt, she never celebrated my birthday. Today is my first birthday where I am not sad and I am feeling very happy, as if I am in a loving family. This is the first time that so many people have celebrated with me on my birthday. I want to thank God for bringing love and a loving family into my life.”</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">This is true freedom being delivered through God’s love. Sarita’s birthday used to be a reminder of her bondage and it now it is a reminder of love and freedom. Our community is full of people who need freedom that only God can deliver. If God can bring transformation to this girl, he can also break the chains of whatever binds the people in our church. Let’s spend this week praying for freedom for the girls in India, for our friends in South Africa, for the clients and potential clients of CityLink, and for the members of our multisite communities.</p>
