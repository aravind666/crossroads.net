<p class="noPspace"><strong>Acts: Gods or Men?</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Reminder: this weeks study is about the Apostle Paul, an early follower of Jesus who "changed the game." The study is presented in a paraphrase of the Bible called The Message, which gives us biblical text in simple, modern language.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Upon realizing that the people of Lystra intended to worship them as gods, Paul and his companion, Barnabas, deflected the crowds misplaced praise and used the attention they were receiving to share the good news of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Have you ever been tempted to take credit for Gods work in your life? Directing peoples praise appropriately (as long as its done authentically and without false humility) is a powerful way to share your faith with others. Be on the lookout today for an opportunity to turn someones attention to Gods power and the good news of the Gospel.</p>
