<p class=\"noPspace\">Don&rsquo;t forget to return your filled boxes this weekend. All the boxes have been promised to local churches and charities, and to our partners in South Africa, so a family or a township is counting on you. For more info, see the directions on the back of your flyer, or visit <a title=\"tfd info\" href=\"/tfd\">crossroads.net/tfd.</a></p>
