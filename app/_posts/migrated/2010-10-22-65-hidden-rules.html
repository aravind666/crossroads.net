<p class="noPspace">Culture is created when a group shares beliefs, behaviors and common characteristics. We all belong to one or more cultural groupsbut we dont spend significant time thinking about how those cultural groups shape our behaviors and practices. So how do we know if we belong to a specific group? The easy answer is that we follow the rules.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Each culture has accepted practices called rules or norms that represent the group as a whole. These rules are often hidden in that they are not often given much attentionsimply thought of as the right or proper way to do things. The only point in time when we may be faced with the question of why a specific behavior is accepted is when we meet someone who has a different rule or normovertly positioning them outside of our group.</p>

<p class="noPspace">The same is true of economic culture. In the previous blog entry we discussed three economic cultures: poverty, middle class and wealth, and how the measure of resources we have impact cultural practice and norms. Each of these economic cultures has common rules that cue us as to which economic group we belong.</p>

<p class="noPspace">For example, for the economic class of poverty, the hidden rules applied to financial resources is to spend; for the middle class, its to manage; and for the upper class, its to invest. More closely, its very common for individuals from a culture of poverty to see financial management in terms of spendingbecause with limited resources, the majority of their income is directly spent on basic needs. Due to the fact that there are limited extra resources, there isnt an opportunity to develop the rule or practice of financial management. Conversely, if we have extra financial resources above and beyond our basic expenses, then, out of necessity, we begin to adopt management practices including personal banking and long-term investing. What is critical is that both practices are considered norms. When confronted, we may judge or evaluate specific practices against our owncreating a cultural divide.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>As we look to the CityLink model to address local poverty, we have to remember that it isnt about a specific resource aloneor about achieving a specific class statusits about building resources and practices that help an individual successfully thrive cross-culturally.</strong></p>
