<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Spring  is filled with awe and wonder. Summer is busy with work, external and  internal. Inevitably, autumn must follow. Fall is surrounded with color,  vibrant with the power of surrender. Consider the skydiver, or someone  about to say, "I do." Such huge moments of trust have a strange  overwhelming power to them. Theyre tear-jerking, joy-bursting, full of  exploding beauty in feeling and sight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus  had a season of miracles and ministry, but it would not have changed  the world if it had not led up to his death. Through His death, Jesus is  the wheat that falls to the ground, dies, and seeds are dispersed  around the world. Like Jesus, we too are called to a place of surrender.  A life surrendered to Him, instead of our own selfish desires and  ambitions. In autumn, we become less. We are humbled and we surrender.  And like the seeds, God expands us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask  God to reveal to you the things in your life that you hold dearer than  him. What areas of your life have you not surrendered to God and his  purpose? Maybe its your job, or your family, or an unhealthy  relationship. Whats keeping you from living in full surrender to God?  Maybe its fear, or pride, or a need for control. Write down your  answers. Repent, and declare today the day that you live in full  surrender to God.</p>
