<p><strong>Week 1: The Early Church</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, August 30</strong></p>
<p>The Wait</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to ask God to help you trust him in waiting.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%201:1-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 1:1-9</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>For the next two weeks, well look at the experiences of the early church, the first followers of Jesus. Nowhere in the Bible does it say the church of 2010 has to look the same as the early church, but we can still learn from how they applied Jesus teachings to their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine how Jesus friends felt. After the joy of seeing Him come back to life, he leaves again after only 40 days. And He tells them about an amazing gift hes sending, but he doesnt leave it with them. He asks them to wait for his promise to be fulfilled. They didnt know when the gift would come; they didnt even really know what they were waiting for. Yet they stayed and waitedtogether.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may not be waiting for the Holy Spirit to come (like the disciples were), but maybe youre waiting for something small, or even something life-altering. Just like the disciples stuck together and waited for something extraordinary to come from God, so can we.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever been told to wait when the outcome was unknown?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of someone you trust, and share what youre waiting for; then, wait on God togetherperhaps by praying together or offering encouragement during the waiting period.</p>
