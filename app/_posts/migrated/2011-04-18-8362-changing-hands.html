<p><strong>Week Two: Growing Into Freedom</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, April 18</strong></p>
<p>Changing Hands</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, give me the selflessness to see how your story reaches past me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2034:1-12&amp;version=NIV">Deuteronomy 34:1-12</a>; <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:1-6&amp;version=NIV">Joshua 1:1-6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If youve been coming to the weekend messages at Crossroads (or listening online), youve been hearing how each of us is just a scratch on the enormous storyline of God. And thats what youre seeing here, as the story of Moses leadership ends and Joshuas begins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God used Moses to lead a nation through the first part of their freedom journey, but Moses never sets foot onto the land God sets aside as a final destination. Rather, God shows him the land from afar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moses, a scratch on Gods enormous storyline. And then the baton is passed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Step back from your life for a minute. Think of the children and the generations who will follow you. What freedom story will you pass to them?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203&amp;version=NIV">James 3</a></p>
