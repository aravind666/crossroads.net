<p class="noPspace"><strong>Evangelism: The Love You Have</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were learning about evangelism by studying Pauls words to the Colossians.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,<strong>because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all his people</strong>--the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true word of the gospelthat has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world--just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood Gods grace.You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Colossians 1:3-8<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001rRn30RMBF1fvezFZgVWGGXf78gN-x9dD3hqKmM4JAU8ynsAomuTdpB7pboidZastcc07V82uHEug1h1DKaqJH37pA6XBclMtloBoZjZPVuuooxFXfDu4CKaHLuN3ZUYVg4Cq13NeItbuILdgLJUmoQYeoVHAv9zefZcIHeG2K1ap5UKpiehufg==" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Evangelists share, not only because they care about the topic, but also because they care about the people with whom theyre sharing. And as our faith grows, so does our capacity to love. Its a virtuous cycle (the opposite of a vicious cycle), where our faith increases our action and vice versa.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Invest in a relationship today. It can be as simple as texting a friend an encouraging word, or walking across the street and introducing yourself to that neighbor you dont know.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
