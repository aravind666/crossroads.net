<p>Trembling Worship</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Chronicles%2016:29-31%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Chronicles 16:29-31</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If youve ever considered how you worship, its doubtful that trembling comes to mind. Yet, in 1 Chronicles it says that all of the earth trembles before God, and that all the nations respond with, The Lord reigns! Any act that elicits that kind of response means it was a sincere and understood act of worship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It does no good to go through the right motions, sing the right songs, meet on the right days or say the right words if we arent interested in declaring our hearts and lives as Gods, and his alone (and p.s., none of those right things actually exist). Jesus criticized those who honored God with their lips but who worshipped in vain, because their hearts were not close to God. Their traditions--originally designed to express their love and worship--had become obstacles to real love and worship. They stopped trembling because it became insincere.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do you have certain ways you worship that initially brought you closer to God, but have since become stale, or even obstacles? Have you ever believed (or do you currently believe) that there are certain days, times, songs or acts you must do in order to worship? Where did those beliefs originate, and can you find a biblical mandate for them?</p>
