<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Gifts from a Good Dad: Liz</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Like a good dad, God loves us more than anything. He rescues us and gives us good gifts even when its hard to receive them. To end the week, read Lizs story of how God blew her view of him wide open.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:7&amp;version=KJV&amp;interface=print">2 Timothy 1:7</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2018:19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 18:19</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>LIZS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">My track record as a writer, especially when Im writing fiction, is that it often takes me to a dark, isolated place. So when I was offered a contract to write a novel, what should have felt like an amazing gift was laced with fear---and that fear embarrassed me, really. I hate feeling incapable and weak, but there it was, doggity dog.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I cant pinpoint exactly how it happened, but I was trusting God in some other new areas, and He came in the back door with <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:7&amp;version=KJV&amp;interface=print">2 Timothy 1:7</a>. Suddenly, I knew I had a very limited and dull view of God as a provider. I figured He had plenty to provide for other people in worse circumstances, but a writers melancholy felt so insignificant. (AKA: I didnt believe I was worth His attention.) But God got really gentle with me, and suddenly I knew I could ask him and expect him to take care of my mind, and believe that he has created me to do good work. The gift, of course, isnt the book deal itself; the gift is finding out that I have an incredible Caretaker.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What does it mean it to you to receive the great gift of an incredible Caretaker? Whether this is easy or hard to receive, spend some time with God and talk or write about the ways hes taken care of you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 28</a></p>
