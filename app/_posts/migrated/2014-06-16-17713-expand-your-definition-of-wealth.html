<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus wants us to know that money is not the only kind of wealth. He tells this story because he wants us to expand our definition of wealth. Its not all about how big or small our bank accounts might be---it comes from every area of our lives. And when we give them their proper importance as they are listed below, we will better understand the depth of our wealth.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend a few minutes and list these areas of your life based on the importance you give them. If youre unhappy with the result, dont beat yourself up about it, but think about what you can do to change it.</p>
