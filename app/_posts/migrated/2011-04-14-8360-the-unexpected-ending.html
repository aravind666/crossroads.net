<p>The Unexpected Ending</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me see your bigger story, beyond my own life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2045:%201-8&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 45:1-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jerry Springer couldnt make up this kind of family drama.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One brother is the favorite, so the other brothers kidnap and sell him into slavery, then tell their dad that hes dead. Decades later, the brothers are forced to travel to Egypt for food because of a famine, and unknowingly come face to face with the enslaved brother. And by the way: hes now the second in command of the whole country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If youre Joseph, revenge must seem easy, sweet and completely justified. Yet he doesnt take it. Hes mature enoughhe trusts in God so fullythat he sees the bigger story. Although he suffered greatly, he knew God would use him for good. And Joseph grew into his freedom at the hands of a loving God. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Whether we realize it or not, God desires to redeem our pain and hardship just as he did Josephs. Take a few minutes and simply be quiet with God, allowing him to comfort you and help you have faith in the freedom he will bring.</p>
