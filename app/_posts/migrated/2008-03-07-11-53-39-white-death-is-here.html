Due to the fact that we will all soon die from snow exposure, <strong>3500 Open will be closed for Friday</strong> from 12pm on. All groups planning to meet here or individuals planning to take advantage of our spacious atrium and free coffee will have to find a Starbucks. (Just get in your car and start driving...there are 7 in any given direction from the building.)<br /><br /><strong>This does not affect our weekend services...they're still happening. </strong>If there are any further developments, we'll post them here.
