<p>In the Quiet Places</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to thank God for his patience with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%205:16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 5:16</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Any relationship requires intentionality. How intentional are you about setting aside time to be with God and to hear from him? Do you have places in your life where you go to spend time with God?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Thank God for his patience when you are less than intentional about your relationship with him. Set aside intentional time today to just sit and be with God. Talk to Him about whatever is on your mind.</p>
