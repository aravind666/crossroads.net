<p>Powerful</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2044:24-28&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 44:24-28</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever stop in your tracks at the amazing power of God?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The God who made all things and controls all things is the same God who loves us deeply. God, alone, laid out the plans for the entire physicality of this world. Often were impressed by a revitalized city, the plans of an architect, the growth of something we plant. Yet, what God created and the power he holds is infinitely bigger. He is completely in control; we can rest in that freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>How do you respond in circumstances when youre not in control? Release one thing today, even if its simple.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>

<p></p>
