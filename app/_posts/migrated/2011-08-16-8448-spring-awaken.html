<p>Spring: Awaken</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, here I am. I will remain present and connected with you in this moment.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107139129515&amp;s=0&amp;e=001p04lJlphlIE2KbX02vHqGlzH7mkWeY9OOfQ7bosa6k5zjBPix_L9SyApgEbgcR1TuEOz6H39jfTsGoKIA7cFVLKIdEjeP0g8-cMMOVwglQ2lIDFxiwrVZHrWaShJJn-eg2uDVZEhhFMslShh2-1ItR8NmX2W2nY6Ooj1tYUWab3NTbqvL3HuwU7KHfvgY0G_8H-5ld-TzbkMLLWpwNOrumB1S262Aw-k" target="_blank">Isaiah 66:1-2</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We  dont usually think of God as a funny guy, but there is sarcasm in this  verse. If you missed it, read it again with a sarcastic tone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It  is really easy for us to get immersed in life and forget that we are  all just messing about in stuff that God made, that he began. What will  we do for Him, when he uses the earth as a footstool? He seems to be  joking with us here, as someone might do with a new friend or love  interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He  awakens us out of our small worlds to remind us how big he is. This is  the beginning of a new love, and he makes it clear that the groundwork  for this new relationship is humility, an awareness of our proper place  in the universe. This is a delicious spring love affair that he woos us  into.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What  have you been doing to impress God? How have you been caught up in  finding ways to "earn" His love? Write them down and then ask God to  show you what it would look like to, instead, be humble, penitent, and  trembling.</p>
