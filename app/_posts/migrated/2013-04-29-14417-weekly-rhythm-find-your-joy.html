<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Wednesday, May 1</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue this week to look at what the Bible says clearly are the benefits of a day of rest.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2058:13-14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 58:13-14</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do you want joy in your life? Do you want the very best kind of joy, not fleeting, but deep sustaining joy? Isaiah gives a blessing and promise here: Sabbath= Finding Joy.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">A good rule for keeping Sabbath is to decide in advance what feels like joy, rest, play, and trusting God. Also decide what looks more like depending on yourself and obligatory work. Make some guidelines for yourself. Its just too easy to end up doing work while telling yourself that it is restful to get ahead for the week. When midweek rolls around, are you empty, cranky even?</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">No Sabbath= Short Fuse.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make a list today of things that would be restorative for you--Sabbath yess. Make a second list of lies you might tell yourself on Sabbath to get away with doing work--Sabbath stealers.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 12</a></span></p>
