<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Disciples: Check Where Your Heart Is</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will look at how Jesus parents Peter, and in what ways we can implement that into our own lives. Look at verses 13-16 today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:13-16&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16:13-16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus asks the question Who do you people say that the Son of Man is? He asks this question to see where the intentions of his disciples hearts are. God wants us to fully commit our hearts to his mission. Because we are one body, the body of Christ, God wants us all to be on mission to seek him and reproduce.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pray God, change my heart to be on mission with you. Let me know where I have gone astray. I trust that you will place me on the right path. Amen.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 8</a></p>
