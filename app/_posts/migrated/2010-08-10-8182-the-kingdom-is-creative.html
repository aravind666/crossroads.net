<p>The Kingdom is Creative</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God for the opportunity to experience the creativity of his Kingdom.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2043:18-21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 43:18-21</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Think about the most creative person you know. Its no leap to say that any time we are exercising creativity, were reflecting the character of God. The Kingdom is Gods imagination at work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its easy to assume that God retired from the business of creation after he set the world in motion. But in todays scripture from Isaiah, were reminded that God is still using his perfect, redemptive, creative force to make things right in a broken world. He never disconnects from us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think about the places in the world--or in your own life--where you notice brokenness and pain. Now envision for a moment how things would be different if God totally redeemed these situations. What specific pictures come to mind? Ask God to bring about the kind of redemption you envisioned in the world, and in your life.</p>
