<p>Don’t forget that the official groundbreaking for <a href="/" target="_blank">Crossroads Florence</a> is this weekend!
</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Please join us at 10am this Saturday, August 27, at <a href="/" target="_blank">828 Heights Blvd</a>, just off of Mall Road in Florence. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
We’ll have a time of celebration and worship, along with a sneak peek inside the building. We’ll also announce and introduce the staff leadership of the new site, and share some details about the construction that will take place.
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
Children are welcome to attend, but childcare will not be provided. And, since this is a construction site, gym shoes are recommended.
