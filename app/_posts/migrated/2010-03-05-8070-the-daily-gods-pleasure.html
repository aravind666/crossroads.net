<p>Gods Pleasure</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Many people hear from God through music. Todays edition of The Daily focuses on an original song written for the Free journey by Andrea VonAllmen. Follow along with the lyrics while you listen to the song. Ask God to meet you during this time, and to speak to your heart about the freedom he has in store for you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>From Andrea:</strong></p>
<p>This song is pretty much straight from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Ephesians%201:4-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 1:4-6</a></span>. Josh says, Its simply for Gods pleasure that I am anything: happy, free, satisfied, etc. Thats both very cool and very strange.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hes pouring out his love</em></p>
<p><em>Not a sprinkle but a flood</em></p>
<p><em>We can bathe in this freedom</em></p>
<p><em>Drink our fill and thirst for more </em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Gods pleasure is us as we were meant to be</em></p>
<p><em>Gods will is for us to be free</em></p>
<p><em>Gods pleasure is his children blameless and holy</em></p>
<p><em>Gods will is for us to be free</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
