<a href="/my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=525" title="Awaited Teaser">Here's a quick teaser</a> to whet your appetite for our Christmas show, <em>Awaited</em>.<br><br><a href="/my/share/shareThis.php?url=crossroads.net/downloads/playMedia.php?idMedia=525" title="Share Teaser">Share it with a friend</a> if you'd like.<br><br><u>Note</u>: the teaser is indicative of the show's highest-intensity moments, which happen in only a couple of spots. (Spoiler-alert for those of you who haven't read the Christmas story: angels show up. They're pretty impressive and are always saying "don't be afraid" when they make appearances.)<br><br>The majority of the show isn't so intense. It follows the literal nativity story and is full of lots of familiar Christmas songs. If your kids are sensitive to loud sounds, flashing lights or large images, you might want to consider a babysitter. For most kids (age 6 and up) the show will be both understandable and entertaining.</body></html>
