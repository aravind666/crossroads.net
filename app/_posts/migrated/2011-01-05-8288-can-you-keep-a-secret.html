<p>Can You Keep a Secret?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me understand the weight of my words.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2011:13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 11:13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes its easy to make ourselves, or our situation, the exception. So for instance, what we consider gossip is different than what were doing: were just relaying the truth. Were just explaining to our neighbor why the other neighbor is getting a divorce (Yeah, he has a really bad drinking problem.) Or were just giving someone a heads-up (I heard Matt is going to sit each of us down and ask us to take a pay cut.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>God designed us with relationships in mind, both with him and with each other. And these relationships require trust, even if theyre boss/ employee relationships, neighbor/ neighbor, parent/ child. Trust cant exist when we speak (or make guesses) about others behind their back.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend some time today asking God how you can become a more trustworthy person.</p>
