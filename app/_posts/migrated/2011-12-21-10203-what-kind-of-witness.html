<p class="noPspace"><strong>What Kind of Witness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>LISTEN</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="/downloads/playMedia.php?idMedia=1603">O Come All Ye Faithful</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:8-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 2:8-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">At face value, this is an incredible story. A whole horde of angels materializes in the middle of the night and announces that the promised Savior has been born. Imagine waking up to that.</p>

<p class="noPspace">But whats just as amazing is the group God chose to receive that announcement. In ancient times, shepherds werent just blue-collar workers. They were seen as flighty, irresponsible, untrustworthy migrants--and just as likely to steal your sheep as guard it. They were unclean under Jewish law, and their testimony likely wouldnt have been accepted in court. They were largely worthless in societys eyes. Yet, God wanted them to be part of the story.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of someone who might qualify as a shepherd in todays standards. What good would come out of them being the eyewitness and message-bearer?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">3 John 1</a></p>
