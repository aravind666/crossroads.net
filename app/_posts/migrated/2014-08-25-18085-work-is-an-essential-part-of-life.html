<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Work is an Essential Part of Life</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Like cereal is an essential part of this nutritious breakfast, work is an essential part of a healthy life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:12-13&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 3:12-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ecclesiastes is written by an older man looking back and considering his life (most likely Solomon, the wise king). He teaches that work is not only an important component of a full and good life--its a gift from God. So lets start living and get to work.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:23&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 14:23</a>. Ask God where he wants to profit you in the place where you work currently.</p>
