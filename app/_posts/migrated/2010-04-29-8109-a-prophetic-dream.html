<p>A Prophetic Dream</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Revelation%2021:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 21:1-4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>The book of Revelation is written by John (an apostle of Jesus) who experienced a dream from God. Its the only book of this nature in the New Testament. These powerful verses talk of a time when God lives among his people and we no longer have to live with suffering.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Revelation isnt the only book that talks about whats to come. Much like how the Old Testament speaks of Jesus coming, we can read the whole New Testament and discover that Jesus plan is to return again and redeem whats been broken. We can look at His death and resurrection like the beach of Normandy during WWII: the battle was won, and this ultimately meant the end of the war was in sight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus return is the end of the war, the end of the striving, and the end of this daily battling. We can live in great anticipation of that incredible moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Ask God to give you dreams like John. Write them down.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
