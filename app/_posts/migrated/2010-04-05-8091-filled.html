<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:16-26&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:16-26</a><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">When we experience joy, peace, goodness, patience, gentleness, love, faithfulness and self-controlwere experiencing God. These are the outpourings of a deepening relationship with Him (which is why theyre called Fruits of the Spirit). Theyre also the powerful antidotes to our sinful nature that Paul writes about in Galatians.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><br>Our worldly flesh, or old self, is in constant conflict with Gods Spirit that fills us when we choose to follow him. While our old selves might want us to hold a grudge, crave attention, maintain high-controlthe Spirit helps us release anger, be motivated by love, and live with open-handed faith.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">The Spirit brings us freedom. And with the Spirit, we can reflect freedom to others.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Take a quick inventory of where you think you are with each of the Fruits. Probably, one stuck out to you. Keep that word in mind these next couple weeks, considering where it could play out.</p>
