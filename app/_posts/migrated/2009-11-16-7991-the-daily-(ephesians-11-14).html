<div><br></div>Welcome to The Daily. <a href="/my/grow/gettingstarted.htm" title="Getting Started with The Daily">Click here</a> if you're interested in reading a few tips on getting started.<br><br><h3>Monday, November 16</h3>A Gift to be Received<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 1:1-14<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Following Jesus can be tough, and it's easy to get discouraged--a fact that Paul (the author of this letter to one of the early groups of Jesus-followers) knew all too well. <br><br>So he starts by reminding them (and us) that we have some great reasons to praise God. In fact, he mentions "praise" four different times in this section. If he's going to say something that many times, it must be important. <br><br>You see, Paul didn't want them to forget the amazing gifts that God has given. God has "blessed us," "chosen us in love," "adopted us as sons," "freely given us grace" and forgiven us. <br><br>That's worth getting excited about. Take some time to write down your thoughts on the following:<br><ul>
<li>When you say yes to following Jesus you receive all these things as gifts from God. Which of them is hardest for you to understand or accept? Why?</li>
<li>Paul says that we have received an "inheritance" from God. What do you think that means?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask God for the ability to receive the gifts that come from saying yes to Jesus. Pick the one that's hardest for you to accept and picture yourself opening it up like a gift and even putting it on like a piece of clothing. It really is yours for the taking.</body></html>
