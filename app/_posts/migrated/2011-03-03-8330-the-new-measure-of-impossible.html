<p>The New Measure of Impossible</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me see where you want to do the seemingly impossible in my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Matthew 14:22-33" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014:%2022-33&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 14:22-33</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We all know that people dont walk on waterexcept Jesus, as the disciples discover on this day. But even though Jesus takes a miraculous stroll across the lake, it seems like the rest of us will just have to manage by boat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But then Peter walks on water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter. An ordinary, sinful, broken, possibly annoying human being walks on water. Yes, he takes his eyes off of Jesus and gets knee-deep in the waves again, but we shouldnt miss the incredible part: When an ordinary human steps into the kind of moment that God offers, you can walk on water. No matter where you are or what youve done, your life can be far more than you ever imagined. Your expectations of the impossible will change.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>While it may not be walking across a lake, God is continually challenging us to step into things that seem impossiblerepairing a relationship, changing a habit, volunteering in new territory, receiving physical healing, and so on. Take a few minutes and ask God to help you see the impossible experiences hes placed in your life, and like Peter, get out of the boat.</p>
