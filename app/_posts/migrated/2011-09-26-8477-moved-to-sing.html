<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Have you heard the one about the guy who sang his way out of prison?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Huddie  Ledbetter, a blues singer better known as "Leadbelly," was pardoned and  released from prison in 1925 after writing a song of appeal to the  state governor of Texas. Thats bold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paul  and his friend Silas demonstrated similar boldness when, instead of  wallowing in prison, they decided to sing to God instead. Locked in the  most secure part of the prison, their only crime was teaching others  about Jesus. Yet, they were moved not to doubt God, but to sing to him.  Around midnight, while they were singing their guts out, God shook the  prison and broke their chains.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Where  in your life do you feel imprisoned? Are you trying to work out your  own freedom apart from God? What if God simply wants you to worship and  wait instead?</p>
