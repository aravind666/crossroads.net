<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good?: Original</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pray: God, please lead us today in understanding our full identity, including the role of sexuality in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:25-26&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:25-26</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you have chosen to follow Christ, or are even considering pursuing the goodness of Gods purposes, you can assume that God will begin to move your motives, thoughts, and actions in alignment with him. Thats an amazing thing--that God is good and holy and powerful, and that he wants to make you more like him. We cant do that on our own (although we want to, since sharing our sex history with others can be awkward). Start by sharing it with God, working out the implications of believing in Jesus in every area of your life and with every part of your body.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Close your eyes and picture Jesus standing in front of you. Talk to him about your sex life. How does he respond? If you feel shame, let it go, and try again.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>DISCUSSION </strong></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Share one secret about your past.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Share one way that you would like to experience more of God in your physical/sexual life.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 6</a></p>
