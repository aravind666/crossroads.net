<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Good Sons and Daughters: Be About Your Fathers Business</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish up the week by focusing on the vineyard. Read through the entire story.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:28-32&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21:28-32</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its good to be reminded that this story is about a vineyard, which represents the Kingdom. Just as the father in the story sends his sons out to reproduce fruit, God wants the same things for our lives. His intention for us is to reproduce fruit--whether that is fruit in our own lives or others. From the very beginning, God commanded us to reproduce. We are created in his image and we are about our Fathers business.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, simply listen. Ask God how he wants you to be about his business and wait to hear what he says.</p>
