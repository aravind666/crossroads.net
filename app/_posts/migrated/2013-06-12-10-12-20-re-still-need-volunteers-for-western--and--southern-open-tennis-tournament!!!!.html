<p class=\"noPspace\">Hey everyone!  We still need more volunteers for the tennis tournament in August! </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">This is a great opportunity to volunteer as a village/community and raise some money for future trip participants.   All Justice volunteers will be volunteering together in the same venues throughout the tournament so this will be a great opportunity to meet others that are connected to Justice. Amy and I are volunteering Thursday evening and would love for you to join us.  See Dave’s email below for more details.  I do know that there are two time slots for each day and I’m sure there is a shift/time slot that will work for you.  So, go email Dave right now and sign up.  See you at our village meeting/viewing of Nefarious and at hopefully at the tennis tournament!</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Note from Dave&#58;</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Within our pursuit of Justice, there’s a bunch of things we can do...to get in the game, for the fight of freedom - pray, give $ with our tithe/Game Change, a Go Trip, or some of the many activities in Cincinnati that impact our India mission field. The following is another opportunity to get in the game of Justice... </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">What&#58; <strong id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1370135816168_33276\">Western & Southern Open Tennis Tournament</strong> (formerly the ATP tournament)<a id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1370135816168_33280\" href=\"http&#58;//www.cincytennis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http&#58;//www.cincytennis.com/</a></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">How&#58; Volunteer as fund-raising volunteers with the contracted catering providers for the tournament</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">When&#58; <strong id=\"yui_3_7_2_1_1370135816168_33281\">Thursday August 15th, evening or Friday August 16th</strong> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">By serving as volunteers for much of the rank and file work of the contracted catering providers, by the name of Elegant Fare, our Justice volunteers would get to earn $, by giving of their time, that would provide primarily scholarship money for those in our community to take part on Go India trips. Elegant Fare would provide payment directly to Crossroads, earmarked for India. So, grab a justice friend or fellow volunteer and sign up for either one of our two Crossroads India times. Last year, we were able to pilot this project by sending about a dozen Crossroads Justice volunteers, so that we could get a feel for the serving opportunity (thank you again to those pioneer volunteers!). This year, the great news is that we get to have a whole tent area, to ourselves to have community with each other, connect and spend a little bit of time; to earn some fund-raising money for our Go-Trips. Between Thursday evening 8/15 (7pm-midnight) and Friday morning (9am-2pm), we will have <strong>75 time slots</strong> for our Justice volunteers to be in community, for the cause of freedom in Justice. </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"> </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">We need to go ahead and get names fill in those time slots over the next few days. How&#58; e-mail me at <a href=\"mailto&#58;dmasys@cinci.rr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dmasys@cinci.rr.com</a>Subject line&#58; your name / preferred day-time slot / Justice Tennis If you’re looking to serve in Justice, figuring out how to use up those work vacation days, or want to get of the office on a beautiful day in the summer....let us know! </p>
