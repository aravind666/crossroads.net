<p><strong>Friday, January 22</strong><br>The Foundation<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Psalm 63<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Over the past three weeks, we have said a lot of different things about wisdom. Weve looked at different contexts and ways to apply it, but at the end of the day, wisdom is really about one thing.<br><br>Wisdom is a desire for Gods heart, lived out in everyday life.<br><br>King David captures the idea perfectly in this psalm: the root of wisdom is an unquenchable longing for a relationship with God in every area of life. As we connect more deeply with God, we will naturally find ourselves living more wisely.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this psalm make you feel? Do you connect with Davids feelings at all?</li>
<li>What is one way you want to know God better?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>Regardless of how we may feel on any particular day, the fact is that God wants us to be connected with him. He desires relationship with us far more than we can possibly imagine. Take a few minutes to tell God how youd like to know each other better, and ask him to help you experience his presence today.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Ecclesiastes 12:13-14<br><br>______________________________<br><br><br><strong>Week 3 Discussion Questions</strong><br><br>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.   <br><br>Contrary to popular belief, wisdom is intensely practical. It is all about the nitty-gritty of daily life and how we respond to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific ways is God challenging you to live more wisely?</li>
<li>Are there areas where you have difficulty enjoying life? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p><br>At its core, wisdom is all about our desire for God and connecting in relationship with him. A wise life is simply the daily effect of this kind of relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what way do you want to know God more? <br><br>
</li>
<li>How will this desire affect your daily life?</li>
</ul>
