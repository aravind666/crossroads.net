<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Jesus: Head</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to focus on a passage in Colossians 1, today verse 18, as we look at Jesus identity.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 1:15-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So far this week, weve discussed that Jesus is both fully human and fully God. He is the head of the Church and we are his body, functioning together with him to continue to make Christs identity present on this earth. He went first into death--and into conquering death. His death was human, his resurrection divine. And His death and resurrection made the way for our resurrection--to live with him eternally.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We all are waltzing toward death, only Jesus changes that. Journal a letter to Jesus today, like you are on death row and have just found out that he is taking your place.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 3</a></p>
