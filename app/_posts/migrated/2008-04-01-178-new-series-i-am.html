It will focus on the life of Jesus and what it can look like for us to live a life that is centered around a purpose. <br>Jesus was consumed with his mission and from what we read in the bible, all of his decisions and actions were centered around that mission. With Jesus as the model, we're going to take a look at what it means to be focused, engaged, surrendered, reproduced and alive.</body></html>
