<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Leads by Example</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man follows before he leads. This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about men who have been rewarded for remaining diligent, accountable, and connected to God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you how to lead by example.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Timothy 4:12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You probably know someone who says, Do as I say and not as I do. They know theyre doing wrong things but they keep doing them. Men dont do that. They lead and live by example. Dont think for a second were alone in leading this way. When we follow Jesus, he is our example and we get to show others how to live like him. Its OK if we mess up---and it will happen---but if were striving to think about our words before we speak, loving others even when its hard to do, and faithfully following what God says to us, were on the right track.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about the example youre setting---is it a reflection of who Jesus is? Think about one thing you can do to set an example for those you live, work and hang out with. And go do it.</p>
