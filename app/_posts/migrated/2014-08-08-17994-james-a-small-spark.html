<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: A Small Spark</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As we continue to study the book of James, were focusing on the power of our tongues.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 3:3-6</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of ones life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Why does James sound so negative in this passage? Maybe its because our default nature is to misuse our tongues. Complaining, manipulating, controlling, lying, bragging--James knew it didnt take much for our words to corrupt the whole being.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you when youre misusing your tongue today, and to guide it in the right direction.</p>
