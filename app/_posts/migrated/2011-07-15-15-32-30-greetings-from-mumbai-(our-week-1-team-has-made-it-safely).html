<p class="noPspace">Good afternoon folks! (it’s actually morning here in Mumbai)</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">About 24 hrs after our departure from CVG, we have made it to the hotel safely, without any snags in our plans, and with all our luggage!  That most certainly is a successful start to the journey. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">I’m not going to write much since it’s 1am and we have an early start in the morning.  Everyone is in great spirits, and tomorrow we will be heading out in to the city bright and early.  </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Until tomorrow........</p>
