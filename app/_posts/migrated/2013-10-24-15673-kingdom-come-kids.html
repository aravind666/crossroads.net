<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Kids are who they are. They might paint a pretty picture that makes us smile or say the darndest things, but nothing they DO changes how weas a parent, teacher or their fun unclefeel about them. When they know we love them, they live from a place of love.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have you ever thought thats how God loves YOU? Nothing you DO changes how He loves you. He doesnt NEED you. God WANTS you. When you receive His love without effort, like a kid, the Kingdom of God is yours.</p>
