<p>Locker Room Talk</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, instill in me your boldness and encouragement.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Modern cinema has provided us with some great locker room talks. Coach Dale in Hoosiers, Coach Boone in Remember the Titans-these guys inspire us, fire us up, bring a tear to our eye. But what about the coaches? Who fires them up and makes them cry?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  this passage, the new coach of the Israelites (perhaps the most  rebellious and stubbornest team of all) is receiving his inspiration  from The Coach, God Almighty. Imagine Joshua sitting alone in the locker  room, preparing for his team, eyes and ears locked on his Coach. And  God lays it on him: "No one will be able to stand up against you all the  days of your life... Ill never forsake you... Be strong and  courageous." Now, go take those Israelites across the Jordan River.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Not  only did God give Joshua instruction, but he also encouraged him in the  midst of it. Maybe Joshua was just like the rest of us-sometimes  afraid, sometimes discouraged. But he believed God. Read the passage  again, imagining that God is talking to you alone. Is there a "Jordan  River" in your life that God is telling you to cross? Do you believe God  and all of his promises? Or are you struggling with fear or doubt?  Write about your answers. Repent for any fear and doubt, and tell God  aloud that you choose to believe Him.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>

<p><strong>WEEK ONE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to the Daily.</em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p>Weve  seen the theme of prayer pop up often this week. How have the passages  weve read this week affected your thoughts about prayer? How do you  approach prayer? How important is prayer in your life? Explain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk  about a time when you have been distracted by religious rules, instead  of just being open to God. Is that still a struggle for you? Why or why  not?</li>
<li>Joshua  was an encourager. He received his encouragement from God, and spoke  encouragement to the Israelites. How do you receive encouragement? Do  you encourage others? How do you feel about receiving encouragement from  God? Take turns speaking specific words of encouragement to each person  in your group.</li>
</ul>
