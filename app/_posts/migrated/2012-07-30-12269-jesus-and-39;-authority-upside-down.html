<p class="noPspace"><strong>Jesus Authority: Upside Down</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This week weve been looking at the authority in Jesus words. Today lets look at the way Jesus describes authority in the book of Matthew.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0014gH-7agf8usfDKZEfGYN9aN9uapfbhE1aHQEBAIjqXzSjnmZxdPTf6_F6m20QRnjEpGSj-OaF6fvZsaMVfz-a76j8ZlLWmdFBBu-tIAFXcNGETSvH3gvoy4sShsCxn3kZ3HVVSrT4rgaB6YGTlmMnevx2VvhQut5hg7jFBbzR8fFFtSx0wBzrCt3R1k7zoTXphCXrkXqdxhOQBIs-N9wKg==" target="_blank">Matthew 20:25-27</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Jesus had authority. That keeps repeating as we see the miracles and signs that he performed in the book of John. Jesus himself explained that this wasnt an authority that he used to control or demand like worldly leaders. Knowing how much authority the Father has given Jesus seemed to give Him the confidence required to get low. If you have chosen to become a Christ-follower, you have access to that same authority. Funny enough, living out that authority looks like serving.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Ask Jesus to show you who he wants you to serve today, as an act of humility and authority.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
