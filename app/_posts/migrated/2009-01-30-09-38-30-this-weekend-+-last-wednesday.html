<span style=\"color&#58; #000000; font-family&#58; Verdana; line-height&#58; normal\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Just a reminder that we'll have special service times this weekend, all at Crossroads Oakley only&#58;<br /><br />Saturday, Jan. 31 @&nbsp;<strong>4&#58;30pm, 6&#58;15pm &amp; 8pm</strong><br />Sunday, Feb. 1 @&nbsp;<strong>8&#58;30am, 10&#58;15am &amp; 12pm</strong><br /><br />Last year, our last two Super Bowl services were maxed out. We're expecting huge crowds again this year (especially for the last two services on Sunday), and&nbsp;<strong>we WILL shut the Auditorium doors when we're at capacity</strong>. That means you should arrive early, and try to come to one of the other four services, to make room for our friends checking out Crossroads for the first time. This weekend is going to be a blast. If you haven't already, invite a friend (and bring them on Saturday or the early service on Sunday).<br /><br />Also, because this week's Last Wednesday service was snowed out, and because we're cancelling it in February and March due to the Reset journey,&nbsp;<strong>we've rescheduled Last Wednesday for this coming Wednesday, February 4 at 7pm at Crossroads Oakley.</strong>That's right, &quot;Last Wednesday&quot; is the first Wednesday again. (Insert your own joke here, folks.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks, and we'll see you this weekend. (Just not at one of the last two services, right?)</span>
