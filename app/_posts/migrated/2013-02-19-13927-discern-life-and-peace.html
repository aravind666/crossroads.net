<p class="noPspace"><strong>Discern: Life and Peace</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue acting on what we hear from God by pausing to discern.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:6-7&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:6-7</a></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10:10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 10:10</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We find a daily dichotomy in both of these verses. Every day, we choose to either agree with the enemys death-directed plans, or with the way that the Spirit advocates for us. A great place to start your discernment process is to ask: is this leading me to a fuller life, filled with fruit and blessing for me and those around me? Or will this choice rob me and others of Gods goodness?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of a choice youre about to make. Spend time journaling today about what options lead toward the fullness of God and life, and what will lead to destruction or death?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 1</a></p>
