<p>Moving into uncertainty</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you move forward when you dont know all the answers.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Daniel%203:16-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Daniel 3:16-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its one thing to move forward when success is guaranteed. Its another when the outcome is uncertain and bleak. Yet these three friends chose to move in faith without certainty of the outcome.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right now there are many people who are facing a furnace. Some are unemployed, and uncertain about their future financial prospects. Others are unsure if theyll beat a serious illness, or be able to keep their family together. These people know that there are no easy answers right now. But even in uncertainty, you can move forward with the faith that empowered Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego as they faced the furnace:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are you facing a situation that is filled with uncertainty? Ask God to show you how to move forward without all the answers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p>Read the entire chapter in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Daniel%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Daniel 3</a>. What else encourages you in this story?</p>
