<p><strong>Monday, February 15<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Maps</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p><strong><br>READ<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:16-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:16-18<br></a>(Click to view the scripture online.)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Deep down, we all really want a map. We want someone to show us exactly how to get to where were going. We want to know how to avoid dangerous roads. We want to understand the bigger picture before we take the next step.</span></strong></p>
<p>But a life of following Jesus isnt like that at all. We dont always get to see the big picture. Instead, were told to live by the guidance of Gods Spirit. This means a continual, trusting conversation with God rather than ritualistic rule following. No maps, just a compass. Yet, the better we understand God through the Bible, the better were able to discern his voice and direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whats one area in your life where youre waiting for a map rather than trusting God and moving forward?</li>
<li>How are you comfortable and uncomfortable with the idea of living by the Spirit?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Ask God to teach you what it means to live by the Spirit, specifically in that area where youre relying on a map. Thank Him that youre free and that he wants more from you than ritualistic behavior. Thank Him that he gives you the ability to choose to follow.</span></strong></p>
