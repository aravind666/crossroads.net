<p><strong>Week 1: Lessons About Work</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, June 20</strong></p>
<p>Were Meant to Work</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to understand how you define work. Help me to give up my preconceived notions and embrace your truth.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:15</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We were created to work. When God placed Adam in the garden, he didnt give him a Netflix account and an Xbox. He gave Adam work to do. Throughout the Bible, the people God used the most were often the ones who were willing to work. Sometimes that looked like more than just hard work. More importantly, they were willing to submit and be obedient to God. Working hard can be as simple as a willingness to submit to Gods plan for our lives, and not throwing temper tantrums when our life doesnt turn out exactly as we planned. (Although lots of temper tantrums were thrown in the Bible.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>While He does call us to cycles of rest, God doesnt call his people to avoid hard work. In fact, much of the work Christ-followers do is considered impossibly hard by the rest of the world. Yet thats where God calls us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to open your eyes and ears so that you may hear what hes saying. Ask Him to show you what hard work hes calling you to do. And if it doesnt happen all at once (and it usually wont), ask Him for patience to see the conversation through to the end.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 15</a></p>
