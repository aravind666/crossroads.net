<p>The Best Story</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%205:12-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 5:12-19</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>God has a giant story. Through the Bible, we can begin to understand it. We can understand more fully His character and his desire for us to connect, to partner with, and to trust him. He continues to actively pursue us with his perfect grace and love, and were led into understanding his character.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He is a large and holy God. Seeking Him is the best story for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reveal to you his big story and the place he has for you in it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Weve taken a big-picture look at the story of God. Maybe you read new parts of scripture that changed your perspective or intrigued you. Is there anything you feel prompted to study further, on your own? Why? </li>
<li>If youve been discussing what you read in The Daily each week with other people, youre within a community of people seeking to know God. How can you support each other in this pursuit, in practical ways? </li>
</ul>
