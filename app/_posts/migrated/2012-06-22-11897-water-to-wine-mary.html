<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Mary knew Jesus well, and wasnt afraid to ask. She didnt approach Jesus cautiously and say, "Jesus, whatever you think is best..." Mary knew what she wanted, asked boldly, and even began to move into action.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Take a moment and ask yourself: what do you want? List five things quickly. Now, ask God for those things. This doesnt mean that Jesus will answer yes to all that you ask, but you are opening yourself more to relationship with Him and the good life just by asking.</p>
