<p>Freedom and Community</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Today's edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekend's message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br> READ</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=cqmqrodab.0.0.ya4txrbab.0&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2Findex.php%3Fsearch%3DActs%202%3A42-47%26version%3DNIV%26interface%3Dprint&amp;id=preview">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br> REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Today's scripture illustrates freedom fighting in community. It looks like reminding each other of Jesus' teaching, celebrating his sacrifice for our freedom, and sharing experiences of where he's currently bringing freedom into our lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether this kind of freedom fighting is happening within your small group or other relationships, try to pinpoint how it is changing or challenging you. If you're not experiencing this type of community, consider what's holding you back.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br> PRAY</strong></p>
<p>This week you were asked to take tangible steps to fight for someone else's freedom. Ask God for the right opportunity to follow through this week.</p>
<p></p>
