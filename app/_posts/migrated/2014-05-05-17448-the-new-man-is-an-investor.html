<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is an Investor</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man makes tough choices and takes a minority position. This week, The Daily will focus on what God says to men about living and working in the minority.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you think boldly about money.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A15-17&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">1 John 2:15-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are bombarded with ads, Facebook posts and blog entries about the hottest toys, gadgets and experiences. They tell us if we spend our money on this stuff, well be better men. Its tempting, no doubt about it, but God calls men to be faithful with the blessings he gives them. That means finances, too. While boys will spend their money on whatever will make them cool and popular, a man is a steward of his finances and makes investments.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, think about how you can discipline yourself to save, like skipping the coffee or staying off Amazon. Think about how you can save and invest your money where God wants you to. You can even go a little further and set saving goals (if you want to), just make sure God is part of that conversation.</p>
