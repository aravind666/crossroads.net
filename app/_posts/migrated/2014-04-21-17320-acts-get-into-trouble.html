<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Get into Trouble</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the last few weeks, The Daily has taken a deeper look at the book of Acts. This week, well finish our study of how its lessons apply to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for faithful courage.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+24%3A20-21&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 24:20-21</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul couldnt seem to stay out of trouble. He gave to the poor, he got into trouble. He went to the temple to worship and told others about Jesus. He got into trouble. But Paul knew he wasnt in trouble at all. He was just upsetting a group of people who didnt like him or what he had to say. And no matter how many times he was arrested, how many trials he contested or how long he was in jail, his story never changed and he faithfully followed Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This isnt a free pass to break the law or do something that could actually get you into trouble, but take a risk today that will strengthen your faith. If you dont know what that risk might be, start with asking God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 24</a></p>
