<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is a Team Player</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our culture has a lot to say about manhood, but God says something different about it. Over the next few weeks, The Daily will take a look at what the Bible says about manhood.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you how to be the most effective team player you can be.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A20-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 12:20-25</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve all heard the phrase Theres no I in Team, yet boys always go for MVP. Men work on behalf of the team. Being a team player can mean many things, but the Bible teaches us over and over that no man is made to go it alone. We all have unique talents and gifts from God and he wants us to use them as part of the team---that means our families, school projects, social groups, or work teams.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How can you be a better player on your teams? Whether at home, work, school, or with your friends, do something today specifically for the good of the team.</p>
