<p class="noPspace"><strong>Appetites</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were continuing to discover our identities as treasured children of God. Well be looking at how our desire to be loved can create unhealthy appetites in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:15&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">Romans 8:15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This key verse from last week tells us that God has taken some serious action toward giving us a new identity--the verse says we have "received Gods Spirit" and that "he adopted us" as his own children. Our previous, lesser identity creates unhealthy appetites in us, which we can still try to satisfy even after God has taken us in as his loved, adopted children.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Last week, we started to identify areas where we live as spiritual orphans, rather than as treasured children of God. The next step is to let God begin removing these "orphan appetites" from our lives. Take a moment to ask God to help you see your true identity:<em>God, help me to see my true identity in you. And help me to walk away from anything that falsely promises to satisfy my existence apart from you.</em></p>
