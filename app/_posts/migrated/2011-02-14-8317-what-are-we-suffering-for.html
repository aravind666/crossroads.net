<p><strong>Week 2: Psalms</strong></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, February 14 </strong><br>What are We Suffering For?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me gain a better perspective on dealing with difficult times.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2073&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 73</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>They dont struggle like the rest of us; theyre not plagued with problems like everyone else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ever felt like this? Like you get nothing but suffering for following God, while those who dont follow God are blessed right and left? Its bad enough that we endure hard times, but this makes it even worse, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet if this song is accurate, it is not our circumstances to blame, but our focus. This frustration or envy comes when we expect to have the kind of life we see around us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we belong to God. We are pursuing a different life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Go back and reread verse 25 a few times until its stuck in your head. Then spend a few minutes talking with God, and ask him to help this become a reality for you.</p>
