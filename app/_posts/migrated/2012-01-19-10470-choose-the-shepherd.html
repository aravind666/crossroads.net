<p class="noPspace"><strong>Choose the Shepherd</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God, help me to place my hope in you, and resist the lure of moneys false promises.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">As weve considered this week, God is a good shepherd who actually provides for us what the lure of money can only promise (but cant ultimately fulfill). So the next time fear or greed creeps in, or when marketers point out a void in your life that only their product can fill, ask yourself: where am I placing my hope?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Over the course of the next week, talk to God about how you use money, and ask for his guidance as you resist its power by choosing one thing NOT to buy this week, and instead choosing something to SHARE this week with others.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2015&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 15</a></p>
