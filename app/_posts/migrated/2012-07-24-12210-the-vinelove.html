<p class="noPspace">The Vine: Love</p>

<p class="noPspace">Were continuing to look at Jesus teaching his disciples through the imagery of Him as the Vine. In todays reading, Jesus shows us his own rhythms.</p>

<p class="noPspace">READ</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:9-10&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">John 15:9-10</a></p>

<p class="noPspace">REFLECT</p>
<p class="noPspace">In a society that focuses on what we can produce or how we can perform, Jesus makes it clear that love is both the method and the means. Gods commands are not orders from a slave driver, they are best practices for functioning in love. Jesus modeled a life of freedom through following his Fathers voice, and we can live the same kind of life--remaining in a rhythm of receiving Gods love, and in giving it away.</p>

<p class="noPspace">RESPOND</p>
<p class="noPspace">Have you noticed an area of your life where you have been tense or cranky? Ask God to show you how to remain in his love even (or especially) in that place.</p>

<p class="noPspace">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>

<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 25</a></p>
