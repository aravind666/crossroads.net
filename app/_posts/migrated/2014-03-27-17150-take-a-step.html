<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Take a Step</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next few weeks, The Daily will follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God how you can be more faithful to him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5%3A12-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 5:12-15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Peter and John were faithful guys. They were just doing what Jesus asked them to do by putting one foot in front of the other. It really ruffled the feathers of local leaders, but others began to notice something was different about them. They wanted to be around them even if it meant following their shadow.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Being faithful can look a lot like following through on a promise to someone else. Today, find a way to be faithful to a friend, coworker or someone in your family.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 5</a></p>
