<p>Embracing the tension of wisdom</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%209:13-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 9:13-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The parable in todays reading touches again on a hard-to-define topic: Wisdom. What constitutes true wisdom? From the readings earlier this week, we know that wisdom comes not from being boastful, loud, brash or from seizing ones desires at every opportunity. Wisdom, as Solomon describes it, comes from humility, and an ongoing effort to understand Gods plan, which encompasses a far broader perspective than we can comprehend.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays passage adds another aspect of wisdom: its often quiet and far too easy to forget. But by seeking to embrace the various types of tension weve explored in the past two weeks, we can find a point of clarity where were as receptive as possible to the quiet voice of Godly wisdom that helps direct us toward our greater purposes in life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think about how it feels to find perfect balance, like riding a bike with no hands, or hitting your stride during a workout. Your mind and body go quiet, and you feel a steadiness that may only last for a second. How can you translate that sense of physical balance into a way to recognize spiritual balance? Explore that concept as you work to embrace the tensions that God has placed in your life; when you strike that point of mental and spiritual balance, what do you hear from Gods quiet voice of wisdom?</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 14</a></p>
