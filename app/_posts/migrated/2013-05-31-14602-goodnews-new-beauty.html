<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodnews: New Beauty</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at Jesus interacting with the religious folks and a woman who stands condemned by them. Yesterday, we looked at one meaning of the word grapho--to transcribe. Today we look again.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:2-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 8:2-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We never find out for sure what Jesus wrote in the sand here. The word for write in greek, grapho, can mean to transcribe or to write in an art-filled way. Based on his words, many scholars believe that he wrote down the sins of the men who were there to condemn. What if he also wrote beautifully? Jesus has the right to judge since he is the creator and without sin. The good news--instead of condemning the world (including you), He paid the debt due for all of our sin. But we dont just break even, He redeems. He makes all things new, even the sins transcribed in the sand. He turned those into art.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take your list from yesterday (if you missed, we wrote down what Jesus could have transcribed in the dust about us). Turn it into art. You can draw over it, fold it like origami, or tear it up and throw it in the air like confetti, but dont lament it, release it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 10</a></p>
