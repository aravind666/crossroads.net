<p class="noPspace"><strong>Listen: Over Tacos</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to move this week toward listening to Gods voice.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203:20&amp;version=TNIV">Revelation 3:20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Jesus is knocking, and somewhere in your life you can sense the knocking. Depending on many factors in your life, you may think that step two of Jesus knocking is that he comes in and disciplines you, or says heres the task list, or does a magic show (its possible). There is one action that we have, open the door. The result: Jesus comes in and dines with us. He shares the intimacy of friendship and family with us.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Picture today opening the door and letting Jesus walk in. What does He do or say? Push yourself to visualize having tacos (or whatever) with Jesus, and write down what you talk about.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thessalonians%203&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">2 Thessalonians 3</a></p>
