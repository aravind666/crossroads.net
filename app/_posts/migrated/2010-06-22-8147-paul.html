<p><strong>Tuesday, June 22 </strong><br> Paul</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to reveal his adventure to you and to fill you with boldness.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%206:3-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If youre looking for a life of adventure flipped on its head, look no further than the life of Paul (who was first known by the name Saul). A former torturer of Christians, Paul went on to write much of what we now call the New Testament, and he was routinely beaten and imprisoned for preaching the good news of Jesus. Yet throughout his hardships, he consistently delighted in his sufferings, because he knew that suffering produced perseverance, character and hope. And hope in Christ does not disappoint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To read about Pauls life and to see how he rejoiced in all circumstances is to realize that the adventure inherent in following Jesus does not only include the celebration of a mountaintop success, but also the perseverance during the climb.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever thanked God for the suffering in your life? Paul never suggested the suffering he experienced was put there by God, yet he was thankful for it, as he knew it would lead him closer to the character of Jesus, who he longed to be like. What feels like suffering in your life right now? Try reflecting on Pauls statement again (2 Corinthians 6:3-10) and ask God to build in you the perseverance needed to produce character, and ultimately hope.</p>
