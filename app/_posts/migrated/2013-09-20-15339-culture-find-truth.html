<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Culture: Find Truth</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We have been looking at a passage in Ephesians 4 this week, by adding one or two verses each day. Today, we make a turn toward the culture of Christ in verses 20-21.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:18-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4:18-21</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There is a deceptive culture in this world. There is fear, confusion, isolation and pride knit into media, systems, workplaces and even family cultures. To see the truth about any culture with which you have contact, just ask Jesus to reveal it to you. Finding truth can only happen in the creator of truth--its in Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write down some communities or cultures you are in. Ex: United States, Cincinnati, Xavier, P&amp;G, family of origin, medical system, club or social network. Now ask God to give you a word or sentence about what he wants you to be aware of in each one.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Luke 6</a></p>
