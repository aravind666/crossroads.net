This weekend we're going to be talking about how generous communities change the world. A few weeks ago, we gave out cards titled <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/Commitment.pdf\">What Could You Give</a> that challenged all of us to be thinking about how we can be generous with our time and money to bring freedom to others. (For more on this, you can <a href=\"../../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=563\">watch</a> or <a href=\"../../my/media/messages.php\">listen to</a> Brian Tome's talk from week four.) This weekend (March 15-16th) we're going to be using those cards to &quot;mark the moment&quot; and commit to living generous lives.<br /><br />Last weekend we also handed out a brochure called <a href=\"../consumed/YouAreHere.htm\">You Are Here</a> that highlights some of the great things happening in our community and some of the ways in which Crossroads is being a blessing to our city and the world. When generous individuals come together into generous communities, freedom is the result.<br /><br />It's going to be an incredible weekend. Let's...hope...there's...no...snow....
