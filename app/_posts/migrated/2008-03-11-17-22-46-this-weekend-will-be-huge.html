<html><body><p>This weekend we're going to be talking about how generous communities change the world. A few weeks ago, we gave out cards titled <a href="">What Could You Give</a> that challenged all of us to be thinking about how we can be generous with our time and money to bring freedom to others. (For more on this, you can <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">watch</a> or <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">listen to</a> Brian Tome's talk from week four.) This weekend (March 15-16th) we're going to be using those cards to "mark the moment" and commit to living generous lives.<br><br>Last weekend we also handed out a brochure called <a href="/messages/2008-07-14-week-two.html">You Are Here</a> that highlights some of the great things happening in our community and some of the ways in which Crossroads is being a blessing to our city and the world. When generous individuals come together into generous communities, freedom is the result.<br><br>It's going to be an incredible weekend. Let's...hope...there's...no...snow....</p></body></html>
