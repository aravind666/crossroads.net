<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man has an Adviser</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man makes tough choices and takes a minority position. This week, The Daily will focus on what God says to men about living and working in the minority.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to bring you closer to him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A5-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 3:5-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its a tough choice to stand in the minority. But weve got the best adviser and friend when it comes to helping us make the tough choices: God. Through prayer and spending time with Him, we can have a close relationship just like we might have with a friend or spouse. When were faced with taking a minority position, God has something to say about it. He wont make the decision for us---thats where free will comes in---but he will help us to take that position if we listen.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Maybe you and God are best friends. Maybe you dont know how you feel about him. Either way, set aside some time today and listen for his voice. You can ask him anything you want, but leave most of the time to just listen for what hes saying to you.</p>
