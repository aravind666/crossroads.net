<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week well look at the weekly rhythm that God intended for us since the beginning: Sabbath rest.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2031:13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Exodus 31:13</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We as Americans are self made, right? We are busy and its a status symbol. Were so important that we cant stop. So what if we do stop? What if we rest? Sabbath was a day set aside by God since the beginning of time to renew our connection with him. Instead of being self-made, we can be re-created every week by the only one who can make us perfect and holy, the creator of the universe. We can be God-made, and re-made again weekly. Its a sacred invitation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have ten minutes of Sabbath right now. Close your eyes and invite God to make you holy.</p>
