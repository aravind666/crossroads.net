<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Ask God to make his love and grace flow out of you and into the lives of people youll be with today.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>In  the ancient world, a proclaimer of any kind of good news was considered  an evangelist. Today we might describe an evangelist in other  ways--like Malcolm Gladwell (author of The Tipping Point), who made popular the term "maven":</p>
<p>a person who finds something, loves it, and then brings others into the fold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This  describes Jeremiah to a tee. His love for God is a pure fire in him  that is impossible to contain. And this wasnt because Jeremiahs life  was easy or perfect (read more of Jeremiah and youll quickly find that  out), but because Jeremiah had the radical experience of a relationship  with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday in The Daily you considered one of Jesus characteristics that has drawn you to him. Tie that characteristic directly to an experience youve had where that characteristic significantly affected the outcome. </p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
