<p>The Change-Up</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for covering me with your wisdom and peace.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2011:28-30&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 11:28-30</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2011:28-30&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"></a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Other people might not understand the peace you have (or begin to have) because of Jesus. You might not understand it. Thats OK. Jesus is countercultural; so is His peace. His peace (your peace) does not need a logical explanation. It wont fit a mold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A story of peace:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Something had to change in my life. Two small kids, craziness, and my husband was barely around. I thought divorce was the only option. But something moved in my heart and told me to change my attitude. This prompting didnt seem fair. My husband seemed like the one who was so clearly in the wrongbut I just went with it. It was humbling and it took extra effort that I didnt think I had in me. But I decided to make our home a place he actually wanted to come home to. After a few months, he responded. He started enjoying our life again, and so did I. I know God gave me that inner strength and peace of mind to bear up. And I obeyed His prompting to try. I felt His peace in a way that barely made sense.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If youre experiencing peace, you might have someone who challenges itor who, intentionally or unintentionally, tries to recreate your anxiety or questions. Ask God to guard your heart from those things, and to continue to fill you with peace.</p>
