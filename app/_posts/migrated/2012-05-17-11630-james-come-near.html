<strong>James: Come Near</strong>
This week, were learning what James has to teach us about humility.

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
"Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up."
<em>James 4:8-10 <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001K0UQWjQ0odYOD6PupHBxkZuvDg3irTB6TG5AhHfJ9xbb591MGYDw-UaV2U207jtvdDQ8q4FM0lQnNNmwbhmqz5fxmkT23Xjs1wUmOba1cL8m1Egei4kqFfSUMdEJReAYAcj93p30ufRwLXVfCq48h_tf6y9jUNkuRe8JaB2ct0dM-RlLTYREqg==" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em>

<strong>REFLECT</strong>
Our hearts really can fill with grieving and mourning when we realize weve rejected a God who desires a loving, intimate relationship with us. But the good news is, Hes always on our side, and always ready to draw near to us.
