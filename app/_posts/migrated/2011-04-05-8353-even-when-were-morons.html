<p>Even When Were Morons</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for your unending love. Show me areas where you show up that Ive ignored or passed off as something other than the tremendous love you have to offer me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%208:1-22&amp;version=NIV">1 Samuel 8:1-22</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Those Israelites sure have a lot of nerve. After God (literally) moved heaven and earth to get them out of slavery in Egypt (check out Exodus 14) the Israelites demand a new king to lead them. Even though God has specifically appointed Samuels sons as their leadership. Even though He has promised them protection and generations that will outnumber the stars in the sky. Even though He has told them outright that a king will be damaging to their people. Yes, even with all of this coming directly from a god whos never broken a single promise, they reject Him completely. They demand a king who will lead them into battle and win them new land. They petition like crazy and, in the end, God gives them exactly what they want.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So even though He told them it was a bad idea (and it was) and even though he told them it would hurt them (and it did), God let them make that choice. Dont mistake that for giving in or even for something that resembles apathy. It was love. Knowing the best decision to make and the best possible outcome, but still giving the Israelites freedom to choose, and still sticking around for the messy aftermath, is a picture of faithfulness. And its a total love-fest.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Were not very different from the Israelites when it comes down to it. God speaks to you. Are you listening, or are you still going the way that sounds good to your heart, your head, your stomach or your emotions? What would it look like to ask God questions and actually wait on him for answers?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 13</a></p>
