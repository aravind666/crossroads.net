<p>The Voice of Prophets</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2053:1-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 53:1-12</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>The next books of the Bible are the Major and Minor Prophets. The Majors are Isaiah through Daniel, and the Minors are Hosea through Malachi. Some of these books are speaking to Judah, and some to the northern kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All of these books reveal strong voices speaking out to the Hebrew people about how to return to God, and theyre filled with hints of what Gods plan is to redeem them. Gods story is always one of redemption. His people (then and now) are always giving away their hearts to something less than Gods best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Isaiah, God foretells his ultimate plan for redemption: Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>In the scripture you read, can you see how God was foretelling his plan? Think of any place in your life where God has been speaking to you and thank him for revealing himself. If youve felt distant from God recently, take some time right now to ask him to reveal himself to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p>You can finish one of the books of the Minor Prophets in one sitting. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-International-Version-NIV-Bible/#books">Try it</a>.</p>
