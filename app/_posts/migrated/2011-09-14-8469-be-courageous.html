<p>Be Courageous</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes talking to God about whats been going on in your daily life.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Often  we look at men and women who seem adventurous and wonder how they  possess the courage to do what they do. Whether its jumping out of  plane or opening a restaurant, we often aspire to the fearlessness  celebrated in our culture. But a look at Daniels story reveals a  different kind of courage in the face of intense adversity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unafraid  of the consequences, Daniel obeyed God and worshipped only him. Because  of his countercultural behavior, dishonest men threw him into a den of  lions. But when the miraculous happened and his life was spared, Daniel  wasnt interested in his own glory. His courage came from trusting God  with his life, and come what may, he rested in the promise that he was  Gods and had nothing to fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask  God to fill you with the level of courage Daniel had, based on an  unfailing trust in Him. Invite the Holy Spirit to reveal any areas of  your life where you dont trust him yet, whether thats in  relationships, work or provisions. Could any of these areas be holding  you back from pursuing an adventure God has for you?</p>
