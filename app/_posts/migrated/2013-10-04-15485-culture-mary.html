<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>#Culture: Mary</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Mary had a whole different way of approaching Jesus being at their house. Martha was busy doing. Mary was busy, too. She sat at Jesus feet and she listened. There is so much that Martha and Mary can offer to Jesus, but Mary offers her full attention.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Are you reading this on the fly? Are you in a hurry to go or move on to the next thing? Can you stop right now, and listen? If not, decide a time today when you are going to stop and listen, and then set an alarm to remind yourself or stick a rubber band around your wrist to remember, and then do it. Give yourself ten minutes at the least, more if you have it. #goMaryalltheway</p>
