<p>Embrace the tension of timing</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:9-15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 3:9-15</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The passages from Ecclesiastes well study for the next two weeks explore the various ways tension manifests itself in our lives. From patience to vanity, work to relationships, positive and negative tensions are constants in our lives. At their worst, these tensions can make it difficult to believe in a loving, caring God who has bigger plans for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But at its best, this tension can be faith building and inspiring. Todays reading, for example, tackles the idea of timing; who doesnt wish now and then that we could get what we want when we want it, rather than having to wait. Maybe its greed, fear of losing what we desire or a side effect of todays instant-access culture. But just as fighting against Gods timing causes great tension, this passage comforts us with the message that taking the opposite track - embracing the idea that the timing of our lives fits Gods plan, and isnt really in our control - can relieve that tension and give us a clearer view of Gods grand plan for our lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider the clich phrase, "good things come to those who wait." Jot down a few examples in your own life where this has been true. If youre struggling with patience in some aspect of your life right now, does recalling these past experiences give you a better perspective on how to handle your current challenge?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong> <br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%206&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 6</a></p>
