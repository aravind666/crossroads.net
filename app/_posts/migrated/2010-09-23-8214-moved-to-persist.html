<p>Moved to Persist</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you persist in prayer.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2018:1-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 18:1-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Think of the most persistent person you know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two things are likely true of this person: theyre annoying at times, and their persistence pays off. If you were to apply this kind of persistence to your prayer life, what would change about how or when you pray?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus tells the story of a persistent widow who annoys an apathetic judge so much that he eventually gives her the justice she seeks. Jesus told this story to show them [his followers] that they should always pray and not give up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We often think of prayer as a passive spiritual act, but its not. Prayer is the most aggressive move we make to experience God and invite his kingdom to manifest in the world. Even when it appears all hope is lost and nothing will change, we should always pray and never lose heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Make an aggressive move to incorporate prayer into the next 24 hours. Dont allow the busyness of your schedule to keep you from experiencing God today.</p>
<p></p>
