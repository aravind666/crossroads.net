<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When  Jesus gets ahold of our lives--when we know him as a person verses an  idea--we get the opportunity to bring others into the same knowingness.  But we dont have to be subject matter experts or brilliant spokesmen.  We can just pass on our stories. And in this way, we get to be part of  the Christmas invitation. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think  of a Christmas carol you know (preferably one about Jesus, not  Rudolph). At some point today, sing it out loud--even if its just the  chorus. Or if you want to really have fun, get some friends together, do  some spontaneous caroling and love thy neighborhood.</p>
