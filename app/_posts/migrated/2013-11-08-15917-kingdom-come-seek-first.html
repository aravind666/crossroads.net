<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In the morning, one of the first things you might do is think about what the day might bring. And if its Monday--what will the week bring? These thoughts set into motion a string of worries. Will I eat lunch today? Will I get home in time for dinner with my family? Will I make it to Friday? And so on.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus says not to worry, but to "seek first the Kingdom of God." By putting aside our worry and actively seeking--receiving His love, obeying his commands, sharing His love with others--our Dad will provide for all our needs and desires. In other words, He will give us the Kingdom.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">RESPOND</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What are you worried about today? It could be anything. Instead of worrying about it, seek out what your Dad is telling you about that worry. Take a minute or two and give that worry to God.</p>
