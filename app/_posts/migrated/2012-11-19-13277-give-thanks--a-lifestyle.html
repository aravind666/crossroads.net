<p class="noPspace"><strong>Give Thanks: A Lifestyle</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Giving thanks is a lifestyle, not a day. Continue to give thanks, even as the holiday ends and we wrap up this weeks Daily series on giving thanks.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0019CdJ8nfJIJ4ePTPI1mBhMVbUzsqCS3Bj7jc6zV4OjGCEbZxNluV8-00OD7mUqRCe_FiP0xll6gt5kEUs6nQbmuxxsyCkDm-2UDAImO54WqIelZegHrCfIbA0koDZ8fB9TWZiMKs1iKwG8nsp6KS27so18p060Y--ah_EqdfrPG9mYeXIlZfhp3ouc5sMxdDYU5elTg7gTyM=" shape="rect" target="_blank">Psalm 75:1</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">What does it mean that His name is near? In the Old Testament, folks viewed Gods name as holy, therefore saying or writing it was a holy act. He was seen as present and accessible to his people through his name.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Today, focus on not just being thankful, but giving thanks very specifically to God by name. Like, "Thank you God for..." or "Jesus, thank you..." or "Spirit, let me be thankful." Journal it or say it out loud.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Did you experience thanking God this week, even when you felt down? What was it like?</li>
<li>What happened when you thanked God publicly?</li>
<li>How do you feel about Gods name making him accessible to you?</li>
</ul>
