You can follow their activity so far on the <a href="/goneworleansblog" title="GO New Orleans blog">GO New Orleans blog</a>, including meeting with local Habitat leaders and touring the devastated 9th Ward. The blog will include twitter updates from throughout the day, posted by 5pm, so check back daily.<br><br>The first team will work in New Orleans until July 19, when a new team of 300 arrives who will be serving until July 26. As you read about their trip, please pray for safety, good weather, productive work and most of all life change both for those serving and the people they serve.</body></html>
