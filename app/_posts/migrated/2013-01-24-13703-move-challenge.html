<p class="noPspace"><strong>Move: Challenge</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to look at Pauls way of sharing his faith with the people in Athens as a model for us keeping our faith moving. In yesterdays passage, he connected and invited. Today, Paul challenges.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001zW6BQK0VKBgww6rljx7oNmylJwizsNHgQMZ6LFdhBDuy0MuuMGmp-57ofCTKqBUCKGjEkpKG-3DRCTY8am6D_vH5klb881BDmql7fCa-ijjbLwE3FFXk9L4GMCN0E2Q0ZEun4gwcU8A5VIAWEMv6RAPw6EWkcKCOwOLjbAKq8KcR4xN8lw5Kz28_B2151u4WYn7IvsOuT-DMFuQN1l0KMA==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts:17:29-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Paul has led through humility and made connections that show he honors the Athenians poetry and interests. He now leverages that influence to challenge them. Paul places a fork in the road.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Usually, we favor connecting or challenging, but not both. Push yourself to embrace both, even if one makes you uncomfortable. Paul (and Jesus) did both. Truly, if you are experiencing God changing your life and the radical impact of being a part of a patchwork family, youll want others to find what you have found. Slow down and invite. Pull close and challenge.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Make a list of the ways that God has impacted your life. How has he been the good news in your story? We can be motivated to move when we remember.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
