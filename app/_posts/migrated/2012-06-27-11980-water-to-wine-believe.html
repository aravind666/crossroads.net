<p class="noPspace"><strong>Water to Wine: Believe</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">The disciples have decided to follow Jesus. Some if not all are attending this wedding in Cana with him. We know that this is the first miracle that they are witnessing. So at this point they may have just believed that they were following a good Rabbi or teacher. Read the story as if you were witnessing your teacher or mentor performing a miracle.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Jesus is beginning to reveal his true self to his disciples. This is more than a good teacher. This is a man who has power over the very elements that God created: water. Jesus is beginning to reveal to the disciples that he is not just a man, but the very nature of God. By continuing to follow him, the disciples are saying they agree.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Was Jesus simply a great teacher, or was he actually God in the flesh? Believing the latter changes everything. If you believe this, how might that truth affect your day-to-day actions?</p>
