<p>Responsive</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2011:9-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 11:9-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God hears you when you talk to him. Yet He doesnt stop there; he responds. This is what Jesus is saying in this passage from Luke. If you ask, you receive. If you seek, you find.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This promise is hard for many of us to believe. In our instant-message, instant-response kind of world, weve limited our understanding of what a response looks and sounds like. But consider it this way: the worlds ask and response system is two-dimensional and complicated by human limitations. Gods system is three-dimensional. He knows all, has all power, and because of his unconditional love for us, he knows the perfect way to respond. We can expect that.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What are you asking for right now? What answer are you trying to solve? Write it down, or say it out loud. It might take longer than you expect, but as you write or talk, remember Gods promise to respond.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p>Read Luke 11:9-11 again and let it fill you with peace.</p>
