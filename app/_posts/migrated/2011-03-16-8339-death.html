<p>Death?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, bring me to a new understanding of your power, and what that power signifies.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway Matthew 28:1-10" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:1-10&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 28:1-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>As a general rule, death is one of those things we tend to count on. When someones dead, theyre dead, and thats the end of it. Except when God has something to do with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before Jesus died, he promised he would come back from the deadand as to be expected, no one believed him. Until, that is, he did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Again, imagine the expectations that fell to pieces. Imagine if youd chosen to be part of Jesus crowd, you watch him do incredible miracles, and then he gets murdered. It wouldnt be the ending youd expect or want for your nations rescuer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet, its what gave us a beginning. Its what freed us from death. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes and talk with God about your feelings on death. If you are struggling to believe that He will bring you back from the dead, then talk with him about that.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
