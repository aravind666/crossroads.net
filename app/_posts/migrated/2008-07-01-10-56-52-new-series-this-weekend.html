This weekend we begin a new teaching series called &quot;ONE.&quot; This is a slight modification of a series that hundreds of churches have been doing all over the country during the month of June. Here's a brief description:<br /><br /><strong>ONE</strong><br />When Jesus prayed a final prayer for his followers, the main thing he asked was that God would make them &ldquo;one.&rdquo; During our summer series we&rsquo;re inviting in some of our favorite teachers and asking them what they see God doing in the world today in an effort to learn from them and become one.
