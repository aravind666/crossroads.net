<strong><div><br></div>Wednesday, November 18<br></strong>No Longer Dead<strong><br><br>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 2:1-10<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>On our own, we fall so short of the way God designed our lives to work that were declared dead. Not injured, sick or even abandoned. Dead.<br><br>How did we get this way?<br><br>In verses 1-3, Paul describes our desire to follow ways that destroy others and us. (The ruler of the kingdom of the air is Satan, Gods main adversary). Simply put, because of the choices we make against God (sin), we are dead people producing death over time.<br><br>Now read Ephesians 2:4-6 again.<br><br> What changes for us? Why?<br> What does this mean for your life today?<br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Begin by asking God to reveal anything that is in your mind or life that brings you death. As He reveals things to you, tell him that you want no more of it in your life. Then, thank God for what he has chosen to do. Read verses 4-6 once more, this time to God, thanking him. Ask for more dependence on Him today to enjoy those good things.<br>
