<p class="content">If you&rsquo;re processing   something for which you&rsquo;d like to receive prayer, you&rsquo;re invited to sign   up for a 45 minute session of reflective listening and focused prayer,   during which two trained members of our Prayer Team will listen to you   describe the need you have and then pray for you, with you. Please <a title="Email Susan Levey" href="http://www.crossroads.net/mysend/135" target="_blank">email  us</a> to make an appointment for an upcoming Thursday night  (availability is limited), and please include your phone number.</p>
