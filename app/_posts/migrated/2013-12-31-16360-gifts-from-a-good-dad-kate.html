<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>KATES STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Growing up, it was the family norm to look as if we had it all together on the outside, yet our family structure was falling apart inside. There was bitterness, depression, marital issues and the list goes on. I knew I wanted something more. God promised he would give me family, a new sense of family. Although I had no idea what that looked like at the time.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Within the past few years God has not only redeemed my biological family structure, but has also given me a spiritual family. The way I imagined Gods promise being fulfilled was that I would get only one or the other. Wrong. God gave me more than I could have ever imagined. An abundance of family. He tends to do that, give me more than I deserve.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make a list of the things that look like an abundant life to you. Hang it up in your home or at work in a place you will see it everyday. Your Dad wants to give it to you---it may not look exactly like your list, but let it be a reminder that when you trust your Dad, your life is abundant.</p>
