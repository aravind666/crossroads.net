<p><strong>Monday, May 30 </strong><br>Receive</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, I understand that Im a work in progress. Help me to take another step toward you today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2051&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 51</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Repentance doesnt stop with changing. Repentance requires receiving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>David is definitely a guy who has something to say about receiving. He started out golden: he saved his people by killing a giant against all odds and was to be the next king of his people. When he becomes king, he falls in love with another mans wife and, instead of stopping, turning and changing (because he knows its a bad choice), he schemes a way to murder the man by placing him on the front lines of warfare, guaranteeing his death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Davids friend Nathan comes to him and shows him the reality of the situation, David understands the gravity of what hes done. He knows the consequence of his actions and also the power of God to restore him. Thats the context for Psalm 51.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Read through Psalm 51 again. Pay attention to the way the language changes. Verses 10 through 12 are a great example of receiving, so you might choose to pray that for yourself. Instead of reading it as Davids prayer, ask God to make it yours.</p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong> <br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2028&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 28</a></p>
