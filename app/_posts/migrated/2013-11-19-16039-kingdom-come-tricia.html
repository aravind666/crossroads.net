<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Kingdom Come: Tricia</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In this story, Tricia tells us how the Kingdom of God can spread.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>TRICIAS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">A few months back I was on my morning run and felt this heaviness for all the women I know that dont know Jesus. So I asked God what his plan was for these particular women on my heart. How would they meet him? And I ever so clearly heard him say, "You are my plan."</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Me? I felt utterly shocked, but that he wanted me to host the Kingdom Come journey in an online group. I really didnt know who I would invite. I started with the women I already knew were followers of Jesus and asked them if they knew anyone like the women on my heart. Out of 6 initial conversations came a group of 50 women. Fifty women! I told God I didnt have a clue what he was asking me to do, but Id walk with him and allow him to use me.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This collection of women is made up of passionate followers of Jesus and lots of women who do not even go to church. We have women that live in other states or are in the midst of health crises and couldnt join in-person. I am seeing the Kingdom in a big way. A friend of mine that has not gone to church is now sitting next to me week after week on Sunday morning.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">It is empowering to realize we do not bring people to know Jesus---it is him. By saying yes to His invitation, we get to experience the Kingdom and we get to see others experience it too.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001Oefz9Iu4PHLkB4xKuaWALxqjuLJLllYeEdbAo08Hscu2Vi6hqb4_rxo8DMWzOS77yNX9pqyinEXYYQ8lwD9qOHvIKbhRSg53fgTSkW7SUsX9gS5TPKhVMLRGMTHiJZxGspsrfNEsCob7fXhJCL2uT4_Cxvb8Eob2QojTPr7L1p6uTGKErsJHWHFxRz7nde7XbqFKwha0dnxXd3Ea5Asl6A==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Luke 5:1-11</a>, Peter obeys Jesus command and witnesses a miracle. Tricia obeyed her Dad and the result of her obedience was beyond her expectations. She witnessed the Kingdom of God spread.</p>
