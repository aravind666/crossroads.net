opportunities this year. Details aren't all clear yet, but there will
be lots more info to come, including Information Sessions and FAQs,
after Consumed in April. So hold your horses until then and save the
dates. More to come.<br><br><h3>
<a href="/gocincinnati" title="GO Cincinnati">GO Cincinnati</a>: Saturday, May 17</h3>Join
an army of 3500 volunteers from Crossroads and other churches
throughout Cincinnati to transform neighborhoods, serve the homeless,
pray with the broken, paint schools, clean-up camps and help make a
difference in our city. Right now, <strong>we have opportunities for you to be a project leader</strong>. If you're interested or have questions, please <a href="/send/120" title="Email GO Cincinnati">email us</a> for more information. Sign-ups for general volunteers will occur in April.<br><br><h3>
<a href="/my/serve/Reachout/goNewOrleans.htm" title="GO New Orleans">GO New Orleans</a>: August 2-10</h3>
<strong>New this year!</strong>
Join 300 other volunteers to help rebuild homes in New Orleans'
Katrina-ravaged Upper Ninth Ward. We'll be building homes in
partnership with Habitat for Humanity and helping bring hope to a city
that many have forgotten.<br><br><h3>
<a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/SouthAfrica/GoMamelodi.htm" title="GO Mamelodi">GO Mamelodi</a>: November 13-22 &amp; November 20-29</h3>We've
taken hundreds of people to Mamelodi, South Africa over the past few
years and are ready to take 400 more. Join one of our <strong>two back-to-back 200-person trips</strong> to make a difference in this amazing township affected by poverty and AIDS (or go for both weeks).<br>
