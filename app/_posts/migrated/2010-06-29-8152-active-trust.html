<p>Active Trust</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Jesus, call me out of my safety into deeper trust and a richer experience of you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This story reveals trust. Its not that Peters faith didnt waiver, but that he trusted Jesus so much that he got out of the boat in the first place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How did the other disciples respond? With fear and immobility. They had just watched Jesus turn a few fish and loaves of bread into a meal for thousands of people. Yet, walking on water seems too weird to them. In fact, they assume it must be a ghost. But Peters response is a cry to experience more of Jesus. Like a kid who calls out to his parent from a high spot, Back up! Im going to jump to you, there is release. It is a trust that goes beyond the known.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter doesnt try to figure out why Jesus chose to walk on water. He simply leaves the security of the boat and steps out. When he notices the storm and looks down in fear, he begins to sink. But even then, he knows where his help comes from, and he calls out to Jesus who gently rebukes him, but most importantly, reaches out his hand and saves him.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reveal to you where you are judging how hes choosing to work. How is that preventing you from getting out of the boat?</p>
