<p class="noPspace">CityLink Centers goal is to move our clients one by one from stabilizing to thriving status, helping them move from poverty to self-sufficiency. (Read more about the process <a title="Stabilization is Key To Thriving" href="/citylink/2010/10/27/69-stabilization-is-key-to-thriving.html">here</a>.) As we pursue this cutting edge vision, we are encouraged by the results of other organizations that have tested out this model.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">The <a href="/citylink/2010/10/27/69-stabilization-is-key-to-thriving.html">Annie E. Casey Foundation</a>, which is focused on meeting the needs of todays vulnerable children and families, recognized how challenging it was for low-income families to navigate an incredibly fragmented system to obtain critical services. Several years ago, they created a new framework called <a href="/citylink/2010/10/27/69-stabilization-is-key-to-thriving.html">Centers for Working Families</a> (CWF) to help low-income families reach financial stability and move up the economic ladder. The CWF approach bundles access to a full range of services, including employment, financial and other support services, in a convenient location to help families build self-sufficiency, stabilize their finances, and move ahead.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Piloted in several sites across the country, the CWF model has produced promising results: clients receiving bundled services were 3-4 times more likely to stay employed, get vocational certificates or degrees that would allow them to move towards thriving economically than clients who were receiving individual services.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Today, there are more than 60 organizations engaged in this way of providing services including major foundations that have traditionally funded organizations providing individual services. These funders are able to leverage their giving for more effective services for low-income working families. </p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">So, while the concept of CityLink Center is not new, it is on the cutting edge.</p>
