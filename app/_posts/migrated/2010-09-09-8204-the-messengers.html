<p>The Messengers</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to ask God to speak to you during this time.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:47&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:47</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The average person who hasnt experienced a healthy local church might not think of Christians as good news bearers. They may think of churchgoers as complainers, petitioners, judgers or excluders. But there might not be as much hostility directed toward the church if everywhere we went we reflected the goodness of Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>People around us should be saying things like, Hey, I really like hanging out with you. Every time Im around you, you enlighten me. You show me what it means to love. Youve really helped me through some hard times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The community described in Acts was full of Good News messengers. They were praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. They loved people. They were Jesus to them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If a negative thought arises today, push it away, and replace it with something good to share.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
