<p class="noPspace"><a title="Matthew 3:16-17" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%203:16-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 3:16-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Its helpful to see where todays passage fits into the chronological narrative of Jesus life; he was baptized before all of his teachings and miracles took place, and yet God chose this moment to let Jesus know that he loved him and was pleased with him. Jesus began his ministry on earth knowing that he didnt have to earn Gods approval. Hes our ultimate example of living as a treasured child of God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you believe God has chosen you, approves of you and loves you, whats one thing that could change for you today?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>God, I want to rest in the love and approval youve so generously given me. Help me to know that I am Your child, and help me to see the areas of my life where I havent yet embraced that fact. Amen.</em></p>
