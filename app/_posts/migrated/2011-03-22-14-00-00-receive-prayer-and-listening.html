<p>If you’re processing   something for which you’d like to receive  prayer, you’re invited to sign   up for a 45 minute session of  reflective listening and focused prayer. During this time, two trained  members of our Prayer Team will listen to your need and then pray with  you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We offer Listening and Prayer on Thursday nights  and  Friday mornings. Please call Susan at 513.731.7400 x1380 to make an  appointment.</p>
