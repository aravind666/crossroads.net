<p>If you&rsquo;re processing   something for which you&rsquo;d like to receive  prayer, you&rsquo;re invited to sign   up for a 45 minute session of  reflective listening and focused prayer. During this time, two trained  members of our Prayer Team will listen to your need and then pray with  you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We offer Listening and Prayer on Thursday nights  and  Friday mornings. Please call Susan at 513.731.7400 x1380 to make an  appointment.</p>
