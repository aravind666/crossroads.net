<p><strong>Thursday, May 19</strong> <br>The Spirit of Gentleness</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before reading the scripture today, spend a minute just being quiet and preparing to hear Gods voice.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2018:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 18:1-4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The world often confuses "gentle" with "weak" or "timid." Yet, Spirit-led gentleness actually builds strength and resolve. The Spirit softens our hearts and stiff-necked rebellion to prepare the way for Jesus to reveal his image through us. We become pliable, teachable and submissive to our Creator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A gentle person will still feel wrongs done against them, but gentleness doesnt allow them to inspire thoughts of hate or vengeance.Gentleness is a strong defense against self-righteousness, intolerance and critical judgment of others.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask the Holy Spirit to show you where you can be more pliable and less rebellious.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
