<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Jesus reputation preceded him. When Jesus arrived in Cana, the official had already come from Capernaum (20 miles away, quite a distance on foot). Jesus sent him back with only his word, healed the officials son from a long way off.</p>
