<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Empowers the Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about how men play on a team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you empower your team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+27%3A18-20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Numbers 27:18-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Leaders who hoard their power keep teams from reaching their full potential. This is what boys do, but men empower their teammates to grow. Think about Moses. He had just led Gods people---an entire nation---out of slavery. It would have been so easy for him to cling to that power and remind everyone who was in charge. Then God told him to let it go and empower Joshua by giving him authority. Moses obeyed because God asked him to be a team player.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What power are you trying to hold on to? Today, let it go and empower someone else on your team.</p>
