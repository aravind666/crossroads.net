<strong>Water to Wine: Get Close</strong>
<strong><br></strong>
Jesus isnt holding out on us, he offers us the good life. Read a little more of the story today of Jesus turning water into wine. And look through the eyes of the servants.

<strong>READ</strong>
<a title="BG John 2:5-9" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202:5-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 2:5-9</a>

<strong>REFLECT</strong>
The servants role was to work for the master of the banquet (who worked for the bridegroom). At this wedding, Jesus was a guest. The servants chose to be under Jesus authority and to act. Result: the miracle happened right in their hands. They experienced the mystery of the miracle closer than anyone at the feast.

<strong>RESPOND</strong>
Is there an area of your life where you might not be giving Jesus authority? (Hint: where in your life are you not experiencing the good life?) Can you almost hear Mary say to you, "Do whatever he asks?"

<strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong>
Todays reading is: <a title="BG Matthew 4" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 4</a>
