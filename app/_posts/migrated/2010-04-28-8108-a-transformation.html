<p>A Transformation</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2012:1-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:1-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Paul, the writer of Romans, had an astonishing conversion from being a persecuting Pharisee (or Jewish high judge) to becoming a follower of Jesus. He became the first missionary, traveling and spreading the words of Jesus. He wrote 13 of the 21 letters in the New Testament, written to churches and people who were spreading Gods message of love through Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In these verses, Paul talks about being transformed by the renewing of your mind, and no one seems to know that sort of transformation more than Paul. In his letters you can find ways to live out your faith, further understand what was done through Jesus, and understand how to function in a community of believers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Consider your day-to-day life. How are you conforming to this world? Ask God to begin transforming you by renewing your mind in any way he sees fit.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
