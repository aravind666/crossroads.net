<p>God is Love (Part 2)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study His nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Jeremiah%2031:3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Jeremiah 31:3</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The love we experience from God is not by accident or obligation. God can do nothing else but love us because he <em>is</em> love. Its not an action he chooses; it is who He is. He doesnt run out of it, he doesnt put conditions around it, he doesnt get tired of giving it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout the Bible, we see God being the essence of love as he pursues, counsels and blesses us. It might not always seem like easy love on the surface, but with a deeper understanding, it becomes clearer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think back when you were loved but didnt realize it at the time. What were the signs of love you now see that you didnt see then?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment and reflect on your relationship with God. Are there things God is doing to show his love that you have not realized before? Take a few moments to thank Him for these things.</p>
