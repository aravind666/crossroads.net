<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Yearly Rhythms: Repentance</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at some key holidays that were given in the Old Testament to see what God might want us to form yearly rhythms around.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9iZDHGW5QbAqccpznH3usgdo08rOY29CS1NujzXMPd0DU0iJ0aIyaN09r-4QndlS_AAJdZtOY7kVRcaa1XqZIkv8j-9fi91qbHT9Yd61EYRdu4iY-MNJJB61rRKMMwsoiKeu2cC0eoUBRHlMk0wydjrpjsFuv4TKWxIk0ipDiW6uF4yu-DP5leBjarYUNQpGSCChC513tH8HoOTcQQZvkTdrQScAmoc" target="_blank">Leviticus 23:26-28</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yom Kippur is considered the highest of holy days to the Jewish people. It is ten days after Rosh Hashanah, which is the new year, and Yom Kippur means day of atonement. There are five key elements from which people fast: food and beverage, bathing, perfumes or oils, leather shoes and sex. Leather shoes are to prevent people from taking long journeys, and the rest show clear communication that you are in a time of mourning.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Atonement means feeling the weight of your sins and separation from God, and then being reconciled. Jesus came to bring permanent atonement between God and mankind. What might it look like to yearly celebrate Gods goodness, allowing us to be reconciled in all of our imperfections to a perfect God?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a moment to journal today about the weight of your sins, and ask God through Jesus to atone and restore you. Maybe its not a day of atonement, but ten minutes of atonement is good practice.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
