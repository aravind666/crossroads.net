<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Spend a few minutes thinking about what this passage says about who God is. According to this passage, why might God want you to spend less time thinking about "treasures on earth?"</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
