<html><body><p>Tomorrow is the last Wednesday of the month, and that means we'll be getting together at <strong>7pm</strong> for an evening of prayer, communion and worship through music. Childcare is provided. Oh, and don't worry, <em>The Office</em> season premiere isn't until Thursday night.</p></body></html>
