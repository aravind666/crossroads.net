<p>Prayer is Challenging</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me fall in love with your voice and spending time with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%201:%201-3&amp;version=NIV">Jonah 1:1-3</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Prayer can be challenging, not because of secret formulas, but because were all broken by our human sin. With that brokenness (which began with Adam and Eve) comes the experience of pain, anger, self-centeredness. And its challenging to pray amidst our pain and anger. Its challenging to continue talking with God when hes pointing us in a direction we dont want to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thats how it was for Jonah. When God told him to go to Nineveh, Jonah was so angry at Gods choice that he literally ran. Further into this story, after Jonah went to Nineveh and saw God show compassion, he was again furious with God. It didnt seem fair. So once more, Jonahs conversation with God was deeply challenging. His desire for fairness clouded his ability to see the perfection of Gods grace. But, though furious, Jonah kept speaking and listening to God. </p>

<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What is a challenge (situational or emotional) that youre facing? Our challenges do not need to end our conversations with God. Ask God to walk through yours with you, and try to stay open to that ongoing conversation with him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
