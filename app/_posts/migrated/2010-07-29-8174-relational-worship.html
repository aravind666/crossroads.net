<p>Relational Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Micah%206:6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Micah 6:6-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So how should we worship, apart from recognizing that worship isnt merely singing songs in a dark room? The reality is that worship, when genuine, should make a difference in the way we treat one another seven days a week. Take a look at the passage from Micah again. Our concept of worship must go far beyond music, days and rituals. Those details dont seem nearly as important as the way we treat our neighbors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hosea, another Old Testament writer, stressed that our relationships are more important than the mechanics of worship: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings (Hosea 6:6). If we want to call Jesus Lord in a song on Sunday, then we must also seek his sense of justice, mercy and compassion. Worship is much more than outward actions; it involves a change of behavior, rooted in a total change of heart. A change produced in us by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What if you saw worship as reflecting the character of Jesus when you interact with your coworkers, your neighbors, and the annoying parent at your kids school? Would those interactions take on a different weight, knowing each was a reflection of worship back to God? Ask the Holy Spirit to infuse you with a spirit of worship today as you go about your daily interactions with others.</p>
