<p>Boldness from Trust</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Holy Spirit, I trust you. Make me bold.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:38-41&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:38-41</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If you read all of Acts chapter two, Peter comes onto the scene strong and bold. Jesus has already ascended, and its time for the Church (also called The Way in Acts) to begin. Gods Holy Spirit descends onto the people who are the core disciples--about one hundred and twenty of them--and we see a fierce new Peter, emboldened by the Spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter communicates to everyone present (which happens to be Jews from all over Jerusalem, gathered for the Pentecost) that Jesus is the one who was prophesied in the Old Testament. Then he makes this very specific call: Repent and be baptized.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Three thousand people came to believe in Jesus that day because of Peters fierce proclamation. Due to the Holy Spirits presence in Peter, we see a different Peter from now on--not simply impulsive, but bold and solid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We live in a fascinating time in the history of the world. God spoke through prophets in the Old Testament, the disciples were able to walk with Jesus, but we can literally have Gods Spirit live in us. We dont need to wrestle to trust God, we just need to receive his Spirit, and he will give us supernatural trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Invite Gods Spirit to give you more boldness in your faith. What might your life look like if you walked in that boldness, as Peter did?</p>
<p></p>
