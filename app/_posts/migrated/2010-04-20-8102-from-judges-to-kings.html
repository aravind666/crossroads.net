<p>From Judges to Kings</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%208:1-22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 8:1-22</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br></strong></p>
<p>The 12 books of the Bible that follow the Books of the Law are considered the History Books. From Joshua to Esther, we can discover the story of God through his interaction with the Hebrew nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Judges, God sets up a structure for the Israelites: they will be governed by judges who settle their disputes and lead them through conflict, and they will hear from God through the words of prophets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After this season of 12 judges, the people beg God for a king. Gods response is clear in 1 Samuel. He wants to be their King, but he gives them what they ask for anyway. These kings are Saul, David and Solomon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As things turned out, only two of Gods original 12 tribes (families) that came from the lineage of Abraham are faithful to God: Judah and Benjamin. The other tribes rebel because they want their own way.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>When have you felt rebellious toward someone? What does that reflect about the relationship you had with them?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%2012:20-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 12:20-25</a> (Samuel encourages the people to be faithful to God.)</p>
