Join us for Last Wednesday, a time of worship through music, prayer and communion, <strong>tonight at 7pm at Crossroads Oakley.</strong> And here's one more reason to be thankful&#58; for this Last Wednesday, <strong>hot chocolate will be served.</strong> (So if you've just got to have your coffee, it's BYOC.)
