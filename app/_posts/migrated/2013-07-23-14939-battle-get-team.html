<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Battle: Get Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at the battlefield in which our daily lives are submerged. Focus on verse 9 today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:6-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 5:6-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You are not alone. One of the ways that the enemy taunts us is in the same way that a bad playground bully functions. Our spiritual bully, Satan, shames and corners us so we think that we cant cry out for help, because somehow we will be blamed or implicated. We may feel utterly alone, but we are not. We are part of the largest family on the planet, the family of Christ.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There are people around the world who share your faith. Right now there are people connected with Crossroads in South Africa, India, and New Orleans. Take a moment to pray for the people in one of those places.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21</a></p>
