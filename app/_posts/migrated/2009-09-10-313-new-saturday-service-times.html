<p>Just a reminder that <strong>this Saturday</strong>, September 12th our Saturday night service times change to <strong>4:30pm and 6:15pm</strong>. We made this move because of (1) incredible, remarkable, elbow-scrunching growth on Sunday morning and (2) so that people who attend on Saturday can also serve on a team at an adjacent service instead of on Sunday morning (<em>hint...hint...</em>)</p>

<div>We'll see you all this Saturday (or Sunday) as we begin our new series on the importance of keeping commitments. I hear there are tattoos involved. Ouch.</div>
