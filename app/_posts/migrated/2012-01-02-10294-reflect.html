<p class="noPspace"><strong>Reflect</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:28-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 40:28-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Pray for the year ahead of you, that God would fill you with strength and discernment. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">It can be easy to pass through our days without considering how God might be trying to grow us. We get used to our routines, our luxuries, and even our struggles. But in order for us to grow and experience the full and free life God intends, sometimes we need to switch off autopilot and see where hes working in us. We need to get quiet. We need to listen. And we need to be open to moving forward or changing direction.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Even if you blew through 2011 with your head down, get introspective for a minute. Find something (photographs, calendar, journal, emails, even Journey materials) that reminds you of some specific moments of your life in 2011. Then choose at least two experiences that you can evaluate, and look at them from new angles, answering the question: What could God have been teaching me, training me for, or reminding me? </p>


<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 3</a></p>
