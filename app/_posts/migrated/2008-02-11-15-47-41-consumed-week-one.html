This past weekend, Brian Tome spoke with us about how materialism offers us false freedom and that it's OK to own stuff as long as our stuff doesn't <em>own us</em>.<br><br>In case you missed it, you can <a href="/my/media/playMedia.php&amp;idMedia=546">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="/my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=545">watch it</a>. And by popular demand, here's the link to that very funny <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/video_dog/comedy/2006/02/06/debt/index.html">Saturday Night Live debt video.</a><br><br>If you didn't get one last weekend, you can also <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/Consumed_Guide.pdf">download the Consumed Guide</a> (as a PDF), and find a <a href="/consumed/groups_small_group_search.php">Consumed group</a>.
