<p class="noPspace"><strong>The Paralytic Healed: A Challenge</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Have you ever seen a father give his kid a bike, a skateboard or a BB gun? Think of the words that a good father would say to a child in this moment, and then read Jesus words to the healed paralytic man.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Jesus implies through the wordreturnthat there was a time when this man had a "sinning life". With his new mobility, the former paralytic could literally walk into sin again; so Jesus gives this man the spiritual equivalent of "be careful out there." Like a loving father cautioning his excited kid, Jesus balances freedom with wise perspective.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Picture that you are walking out the door to go to a place you might regularly go. What might Jesus say to you as you leave?</p>
