<p class="noPspace">Sarah Gravely graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 2011 with a degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders. She thought the natural next step was to get her master’s degree in speech language pathology, but God had other plans. Read on to learn how Sarah’s journey led her to India and back.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>What prompted your decision to go to India?</strong> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">After my plan to attend graduate school failed, I started becoming more involved at Crossroads, and really seeking a deeper relationship with God. In the midst of all of this, I felt God urging me to serve outside the United States and deepening my passion for justice. During the Game Change campaign, I remember watching the video on the India initiative, sensing a huge swell inside my heart, and feeling tears streaming down my face. At that moment, I knew exactly where God was leading me.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>What are some of your favorite memories of the October GO trip?</strong> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">We arrived in Mumbai as scheduled, safe and sound except for a few lost bags. The first two days of the trip were spent getting acclimated to the Indian culture. This was really helpful in getting to know other trip participants and the Crossover Foundation staff. Ramona, Keith and the entire Crossover team were absolutely amazing.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">When it was time to meet the girls in the aftercare homes, I was slightly nervous, expecting them to be shy, visibly broken and worn. Boy, was I wrong. What energy! They were laughing, sharing jokes and conversation, and truly looked like a big family. We had such a fun day dancing, painting nails and receiving henna tattoos. The girls were so open to loving us and wanted to spend every second of the day in each activity with us. The openness they expressed was truly out of this world, especially considering all they had gone through. I could have stayed there forever.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">We took a three-day retreat with the girls from the Crossover homes. We formed strong relationships with them as we went rock climbing, swimming, and bow and arrow shooting. The surroundings—waterfalls leading up to the campsite and a pristine lake with animals grazing on the other side—were absolutely breathtaking, but the most beautiful part of the retreat was the encouragement, love and community support that led these girls to succeed. These people, who had every reason to be scared and angry, were brave and strong. One of my favorite moments of the retreat happened at night when we were able to share an American tradition with everyone: old-fashioned campfire s’mores. Up to that point, we had purely been learners taking in the Indian culture, so it was fun to share something uniquely American.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Visiting the Crossover office was the perfect way to end the trip. We were able to see the building that so many people have prayed for, and spent a final day of fellowship with the people we had grown to love. I contemplated locking myself in the bathroom "on accident." I definitely left my heart in Mumbai.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>You were baptized on this trip. What was that like?</strong> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">While I knew of Jesus loving me and knew of God’s unconditional love, deep down, fear and anxiety were keeping me from truly experiencing these things. On October 12, in Mumbai, India, after a week of feeling hungry for the Lord, I had the opportunity to get baptized and recommit my life to him. I could literally feel every worldly fear being removed from my body. For the first time in my entire life, I felt a love greater than anything I’ve ever known. I felt completely forgiven, accepted, saved and celebrated.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>What impact has this trip had on you? How has it affected your faith?</strong> </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">This trip has truly changed my life. Honestly, it’s been hard coming back after such a radical experience. Friends and family struggle to understand what has changed, and I’m sort of relearning old relationships. Although that’s been difficult, I feel like it has drawn me so much closer to God. It’s also allowed me to be bold in talking about Christ with people I’ve known for a long time.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>What would you tell anyone who’s considering going on one of the GO India trips, but is on the fence? </strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">Go! If you had asked me a year and a half ago where I thought I would be in two years, I would have said graduate school. Although that was disappointing initially, I am now so very thankful God has led me in another direction.</p>
