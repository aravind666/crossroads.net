<p>Floods to Freedom</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for the freedom you bring. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206:11-22&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 6:11-22</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Imagine  Noahs position in this one. First, he must have had to explain himself  to the neighborsWhy the massive boat in a dry backyard? Why the zoo?  And maybe further explain how God told him about the complete  destruction headed their way. It must have sounded crazy, even  offensive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But  Noah put himself in a position to hear God. He absorbed Gods  instructions. Then he began buildingan aggressive act of faith. If  there was ridicule from the community, he pushed through it. If there  was personal doubt, he pushed through it. Noah trusted God would show  him freedom, and God didin a way that didnt stop with Noah. We, too,  experience the fruit of his faith.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Maybe  it isnt building a gigantic boat, but there are definitely times when  God asks things of us that appear crazy or too hard. (Maybe your Free  Journey experience felt like a big movement of faith.) Yet, we have to  keep our eye on the bigger story: God is healing, changing and freeing  this world, and we get to be a part of it. Take a minute to thank God  for letting you be part of his Kingdom at work.</p>
