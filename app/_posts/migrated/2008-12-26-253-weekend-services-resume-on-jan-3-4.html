<strong>Just a reminder that there are no services this weekend.</strong> We are taking time off to give our volunteers a chance to spend time with family. We will resume our regular weekend services both in Oakley and Mason on the weekend of January 3-4.<br><br>If you're still wanting to make a year-end gift to Crossroads, you can stop by the business office during regular office hours (9a-5p, M-F) or donate <a href="/my/give/giveToCrossroads.php">online by using eGift</a>.</body></html>
