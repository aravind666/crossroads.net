<p class="noPspace"><strong>Walking on Water: Unfailing Love</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Weve been looking this week at the story of Jesus walking on water in John 6:15-21. Today lets look at a Psalm that feels like it could have been written by the disciples in the boat.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>How often do we forget to recognize Gods hand at work? Whether He is the one stirring the waves or calming them, lets recognize today both his power and his mercy, his invitation and his challenges.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Write a few lines of your own psalm about how God is at work in your life.</p>
