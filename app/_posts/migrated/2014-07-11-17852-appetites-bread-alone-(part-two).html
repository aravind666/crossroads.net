<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Appetites: Bread Alone (Part Two)</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were looking at how our desire to be loved---if misdirected---can create unhealthy appetites in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%203:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 3:20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Fasting is a practice that helps us focus more on God, and less on the physical aspects of our lives. And the most wonderful part of this is that God---the creator of the universe---actually wants to spend time with us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday, you were challenged to fast at least one day from anything that may be keeping you from feeling like a treasured child of God. Today, we simply encourage you to find the time and the focus to follow through on that challenge.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, thank you for wanting to spend time with me, and for considering me your treasured child. Help me make the time and the space to meet with You.</p>
