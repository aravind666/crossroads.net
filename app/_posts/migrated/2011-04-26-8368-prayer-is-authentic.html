<p>Prayer is Authentic</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me fall in love with your voice and spending time with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20142&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 142</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Prayer should be authentic. If we arent honest in what we communicate to God, were only lying to ourselves and inhibiting a deeper relationship with him. And inauthentic prayer is a surefire way to put our prayer lives in a rut.</p>
<p></p>
<p>David, the author of todays psalm, was brutally honest in his prayers. He didnt pull punches. He owned his guilt; he owned his fear. Heres a kingsomeone who fought a giant and commanded armieswho is now terrified and alone. But David knew prayers werent a time to play it polite. They were a time to seek God, get into conversation with him, and get help. And for that, God forgave and protected him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>No matter where you are right now (literally), try being authentic with God. Drop any excuses or postponements. Then, even if its only in two sentences, tell God what youre thinking at this moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
