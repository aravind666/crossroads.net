<p>Autumn: Wrestling Season</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, may you teach me and bless me, like Jacob, to be in relentless pursuit of you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107401398022&amp;s=0&amp;e=001f5rsNis66UrjX_Z-ol-rA-c6oXkvUV7yfT-4ipE9HC1JqOwcaRdDrPMSLzdWZUaTnrk06tqvqAgi64n8zQ0offktJIo8nUYxmLuXGoL6MOMKj0YLal4AG6_-WqQo3aOLU9zbNIM1motefzULXpVZB6sibtbdJvrN7MIwnPjRIJf4MvSeArdR7Z4xminrlK6dvV8EYiFcKByYSC0wih9gA_41wW29VQis" target="_blank">Genesis 32:22-30</a></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Have  you ever wrestled with God? If you are angry, frustrated, sad, or  unsure, you can take all of that to God. After all, He made you. He  knows your heart, your desires, your pain. Maybe you are wrestling with a  promise unfulfilled, or maybe you are wrestling with a question. "Why  havent you done this, God?" "Why did this happen, God?" "How much  longer do I have to wait?" "How much longer do I have to suffer?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  fact, many of us are uncomfortable with this idea because we are afraid  that God will reject us. But the opposite is true. With every bit of  fight you have in you, you can go to Him. And assume, quite surely, that  He can handle it. You will find out how unfailing His love really is.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If  you are in a peaceful season of contentment, you may need to only file  this lesson away for another day. But if you are not, then, by all  means, make time to write or yell to the Lord. Wrestle Him.  Relationships that refuse to work through disagreement get stuck, and so  will your faith in God.</p>
