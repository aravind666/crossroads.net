<p class="noPspace"><strong>Confession: A Changed Direction</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Were learning about confession in this final week of our study on the book of James.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>James 5:15-16<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0019y1rWgxAmWuIVHlfqwhwVauRDDyRmsCZHFdSQOo1q0r_kLoZuUJpc9GyOfcIkAf_pkbLUpxgsX2i_SVd_LAJ7yl8rC39B9pFenrUzCcCoy_hPRkj_vOnUa98DpDCbk9NIppRvUzX6j1IGgu1AsPJNwsEqRwR94pubQcxXWbfcQ9iKDTdaYyiTA==" target="_blank">(ESV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>After weve confessed something, the next step might not feel easy, but its straightforward: change direction. So whatever mistake we confessed, we close the door on that behavior or belief and move in a new direction that honors God. Were not just walkingawayfrom something; were also walkingtowardsomething better that God has for us. And God generously gives us the strength to make that change.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Fill in the following as your action plan for changing directions:"Im going to stop doing __________ and start doing __________."</p>
