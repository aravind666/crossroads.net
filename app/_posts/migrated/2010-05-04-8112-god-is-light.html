<p>God is Light</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study His nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20John%201:5-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 John 1:5-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Why start with light? Why not start with love or spirit if this is God, too? Because light helps provide context for the other aspects of God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we first hear the word light, we generally think of actual light from the sun or a light bulb. After all, many times when God or a heavenly being reveals themselves, there is physical light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But this is only one aspect of light. When we talk about God, there is far more than just a physical light. Light as it relates to God refers primarily to his otherness--His purity, perfection or holiness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why were looking at light first. When we later discuss God as love or spirit, we can know that were talking about these aspects of him being <em>pure, perfect and holy</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does it make you feel to study the purity and perfection of God when we have all done things that arent perfect or pure?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We shouldnt confuse innocence with purity. None of us are innocent. Weve all done things that disconnect us from God. But when were in relationship with God, the purity of Jesus is given to us. Ask God to help you experience and believe in the purity that he offers.</p>
