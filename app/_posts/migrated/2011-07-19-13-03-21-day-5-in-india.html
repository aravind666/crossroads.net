<p class=\"noPspace\">Good day folks,</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">So today our group got a chance to experience something that very few people in our country will ever get to experience.&nbsp; We visited some of the slums of Mumbai with our pastor friends and were able to pray for and with believers and non-believers alike.&nbsp; Today totally shattered the perception I had of the slums.&nbsp; We were met with tremendous hospitality, and an amazing sense of hope.&nbsp; Today was a day that is etched in my brain forever, and it was an honor to spend it with our Indian brothers and sisters in the slum areas and the pastors that minister to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">I&rsquo;ve asked one of our trip participants to write down her thoughts on the day.&nbsp; Her name is Kaytlyn, she&rsquo;s 18 and this is her third time to India.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been an inspiration to me on my journey, and she models what it is like to step out of fear and in to the strong arms of God........so here&rsquo;s what Kaytlyn thought of today&#58;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>How do you think of the word faith? Have you ever truly pondered over how faith plays out in your life and what that word means to you? Often times I think I perceive faith as a very complex subject when in reality, it is as simple as just believing.&nbsp; Today I saw the most pure and raw form of belief I have ever experienced. Funny enough, it came from a twelve-year-old girl.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Today the group was split into ten groups of two, each partnered with a pastor for a prayer walk. The easiest way I can explain what this prayer walk entitled was going to homes of people who were in the pastor&rsquo;s congregation to pray for them and their families. The majority of these families live in the slums, where their entire house is no bigger than my bedroom. It&rsquo;s really impressive actually, they have perfected the packing like sardines system, because often times the room host a family of six or even more.&nbsp; The pastor, John, took us to a home where the home consisted of the grandparents, mother, twelve-year-old daughter, and a young lady that is pretty much an adopted daughter. The twelve-year-old was bubbly, talkative, bright and spoke excellent (although sometimes entirely way too fast) English. Right out of the gate, she started off by telling us her testimonies of God&rsquo;s faithfulness. She told us that she has two friends that are twins and one of the twins noticed a large abscess on the others face.&nbsp; The twelve-year-old asked if she could pray over the abscess (by the way, the twins are not believers at this point), a week after she prays over it the abscess goes away. The girls are now believers and come to the house church this family host every week.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>The other young girl in the house tells her parents that she has a job but instead comes to the families&rsquo; home to pray and worship with them. Her parents have no idea and she told us they would be extremely angry if they found out because they are non-believers. I cannot imagine the courage she has, especially in a culture where family and their opinion means everything. The family asked for us to pray for them and to be quite honest, I didn&rsquo;t even feel worthy enough to pray for these people whose faith completely blew me away.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>This experience has completely redirected the way I see the way I play out my faith in my life. How silly is it of me that I sometimes try to hide I am a Christian because I am afraid of judgment. This family faces verbal abuse and rejection every single day by their community and neighbors because they are Christians. Yet, they believe whole-heartedly that God will bless them. My faith just needs to become simpler not more complex. It&rsquo;s funny I have to come all the way to India, ride in a rickshaw where I feel like I&rsquo;m being suffocated by exhaust fumes, get brown (I don&rsquo;t even want to know why it&rsquo;s brown, you can probably use your imagination) water splashed on me, and sit down with a family that the language sounds like jibberish to learn that. If that&rsquo;s not God&rsquo;s sense of humor and timing right there, I&rsquo;m not sure what is.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Tomorrow our group will be visiting the aftercare homes and meeting the young women God has called our community to step in the gap for.&nbsp; Tomorrow will be yet another powerful day for the team...........</p>
