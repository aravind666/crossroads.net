This past weekend, Brian Tome spoke with us about how materialism offers us false freedom and that it's OK to own stuff as long as our stuff doesn't <em>own us</em>.<br><br>In case you missed it, you can <a href="/messages/2008-02-10-materialism.html">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="/messages/2008-02-10-materialism.html">watch it</a>. And by popular demand, here's the link to that very funny <a href="/messages/2008-02-10-materialism.html">Saturday Night Live debt video.</a><br><br>If you didn't get one last weekend, you can also <a href="/messages/2008-02-10-materialism.html">download the Consumed Guide</a> (as a PDF), and find a <a href="/consumed/groups_small_group_search.php">Consumed group</a>. (<em>Note: Study Notes will be suspended for the Consumed Journey because we're all working through the Consumed Guides.</em>)</body></html>
