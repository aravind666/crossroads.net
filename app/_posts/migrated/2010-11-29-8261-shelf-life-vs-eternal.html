<p>Shelf-Life vs. Eternal</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me to receive the peace you offer, even if a situation is beyond my understanding.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%2014:27%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 14:27</a> (a refresher)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Peace I leave with you, was a common benediction amongst Jews during Jesus time. It was a wish for someones peace and happiness. Jesus also uses this phrase when hes speaking to his disciples, but he follows it with something unique: I do not give to you as the world gives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He immediately sets up a contrast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How does the world try to give us peace? Maybe in the form of money, relationships, a home security system, a new world leader, a day at the spa. These things arent bad, and they might offer us a measure of peace. They also have a shelf-life, and they can eventually leave us feeling anxious, remorseful, unsatisfied. But Jesus is saying that nothing comes close to his power, his sincerity, Gods fatherhood. He doesnt offer what the world offers. His offer is perfect, with no motive other than his love for his children. And His desire is for our freedom.</p>
