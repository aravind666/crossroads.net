<p class=\"noPspace\" dir=\"ltr\">This thought just crossed my mind, as I prepared for the upcoming weekend&#58;&nbsp;<strong>this is a great weekend to invite a friend who you want to hear about God.</strong>&nbsp;This wasn&rsquo;t meant to be a strategic part of our journey plan, which is why&nbsp;<a href=\"http&#58;//r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001cfYGywSpje4Nz4sD2xwDcdyfN4qsBxuNyxXnzzCbKnng1tHpRKH5UdY4z8UIRs5nNGIU7jAxpmvqYxQZjT7LAsMONOIVC-PuvGvBCDm3W-Qo62r21myUjZlBUBsf41n1\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>&nbsp;is just a crummy smartphone video. We will be talking about the beautiful complexity of God and explaining the Gospel in as plain a language as we ever do.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\" dir=\"ltr\">There&rsquo;s no obligation and no expectation--but if you have somebody in mind and are looking for a way to connect them, this weekend could be very effective.</p>
