<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This thought just crossed my mind, as I prepared for the upcoming weekend: <strong>this is a great weekend to invite a friend who you want to hear about God.</strong> This wasn’t meant to be a strategic part of our journey plan, which is why <a href="/" target="_blank">this video</a> is just a crummy smartphone video. We will be talking about the beautiful complexity of God and explaining the Gospel in as plain a language as we ever do.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There’s no obligation and no expectation--but if you have somebody in mind and are looking for a way to connect them, this weekend could be very effective.</p>
