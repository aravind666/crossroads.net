<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:22-25&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Colossians 3:22-25</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When this book was written, most servants were working to pay off a debt (which might be a little like the workforce even today). Even today, we can look at this passage as a way to approach work. Its a great reminder for Christ-followers to always do work that represents Jesus. Its a good reason to be excellent.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether you are in school or work in or out of the home, how could you improve the excellence of your work?</p>
