<p>Knowing the End</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, when I feel weakened by my problems and suffering, restore my faith in your goodness and promise of a full life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%205:7-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 5:7-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Admiral James Stockdale was a Prisoner of War for seven years after his airplane was shot down over Vietnam. Stockdale helped hundreds of American soldiers survive torture, malnourishment and hopelessness. When asked what made his approach so effective and unique, Stockdale said, You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the endwhich you can never afford to losewith the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same kind of intense awareness and unwavering faith is what James calls his readers to. This was a time in history where followers of Jesus were being persecuted both by their Jewish brothers and their Roman oppressors. James doesnt sugarcoat the truth for them. Rather, he speaks with a sense of urgency, encouraging them to stay faithful and to patiently wait for God to complete the work he had begun in them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If you were writing a letter to a group of close friends who follow Jesus here in your hometown, what would you say to them? How would you encourage them? What advice would you give?</p>
<p></p>
