<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The official worked for the Roman government. This meant he knew how authority structures work and was comfortable both taking and giving commands. He received the command from Jesus, and immediately understood Jesus authority. The official took him at his word, and his son was healed.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Whether you follow Jesus or not, today you can try out giving him a little more territory in your life to have authority over. Ask Him to tell you where he wants to lead you more.</p>
