<p class=\"noPspace\">God calls his people to \"seek justice and encourage the oppressed\" (Isaiah 1&#58;17). An estimated 1.2 million children are in forced prostitution in India right now, and God can use the generosity and the efforts of our community to make a difference.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">But we aren&rsquo;t looking for quick fixes. We know that the needs of girls brought out of sex trafficking are complex, and we are in this for the long haul. So for the past several months, we&rsquo;ve been taking some important steps to build an infrastructure to sustain our work. Here are some highlights of the foundations that are being laid&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A team in India.</strong> To help people in India, we need people that are actually located in India. While this idea is quite simple, it could have been an enormous challenge to find the right people. But God has shown up and assembled an amazing group of people. They are on their way to being established as a non-governmental organization (NGO) called &ldquo;Crossover Foundation.&rdquo; The people of Crossover are&#58; Keith D&rsquo;Souza (Founder and CEO), Ramona D&rsquo;Souza (Co-Founder and Director of Church Relations and Community Development), Muriella D&rsquo;Silva (Director of Aftercare), and Crossroads&rsquo; own Jamie Elkins (Director of Administration). Look for further info on Crossover and its team members in the coming months.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteers in Cincinnati. </strong>Volunteers have always played an important role in Crossroads&rsquo; justice work. It became apparent, however, that the need for volunteer engagement would continue to escalate as our work in India progressed. So, Crossroads has restructured its volunteer teams accordingly. These teams are called &ldquo;villages&rdquo; because they do their work projects in the context of community.</li>
<li><strong>People &ldquo;GO&rdquo;-ing to India.</strong> Crossroads has sent several GO trips to India in the past. Our trips are now taking a new focus&#58; church relations. In July two groups of participants traveled to Mumbai to interact with local pastors and to hold conferences for these pastors, as well as the women and youth (15-35 years old) of their congregations. A Kid&rsquo;s Camp was also held to help bless their communities. The trips were very successful - stay tuned to future posts to learn more about their impact. Two more trips are planned for October of 2011.</li>
<li><strong>The Local Church in India.</strong> While Crossroads can play an important role in this work, there is a gap that only the local Indian church can fill. Over the past few months, Keith has been exploring opportunities to partner with various Indian churches. Several partnerships with churches and/or their NGOs have been confirmed, including&#58;&nbsp; the Maharashtra Baptist Society (MBS), VisionRescue, and Jatiyo Kristiyo Prochar Samity (JKPS). </li>
</ul>
<p class=\"noPspace\">In Luke 6&#58;47-48 Jesus says, \"Everyone&nbsp;who&nbsp;comes&nbsp;to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like&#58; he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard the call to seek justice and to encourage the oppressed, and we want to answer it. We are seeking to build our foundation well.</p>
