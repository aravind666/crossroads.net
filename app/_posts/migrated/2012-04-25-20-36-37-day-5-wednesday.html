<p class="noPspace">Greetings friends and family,</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">I grew up with the incredible privilege of having a Dad and Mom who loved Jesus, and loved each other. As a kid I was under the impression the whole world grew up under somewhat similar circumstances. The one thing that convinced me otherwise was when some poor family stumbled through our little church, telling stories of far off lands and all the difficulties they faced while serving God. I figured that sort of thing was not for me, as I was a fairly normal kid, and it didn’t seem like they had college football in most of those countries.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Fast forward a few years, and I find myself on the other side of the world with a whole lot of folks who had the same impression, until God said "Go" and they said "Yes." So here we are, and I must be honest...days like today make mission work a whole lot more attractive.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">I spent the day worshipping, praying, and playing with a bunch of pastors who are living out the description of the early church found in Acts 2:42. They were inspirational to be alongside, and fairly bad at baseball (although a few had wicked swings honed on cricket). It seems all the missionaries I ever heard growing up left out the parts about learning to play cricket on the beach of the Arabian Sea. Beach resort mission work is the way to go.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Sure, the water wasn’t safe to enter, and open of our participants who put her feet in found her toenail polish coming off an hour later. But Mumbai always a few tricks up its sleeve. So, as detailed in Brandon’s report below, it was a good day.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">After dinner we spent some serious time talking in detail about the girl’s lives who are still in the brothels, and we heard from the Crossover folks who told stories of girls who described the realities of life in the red light district. Lord forgive me if I ever grow cold to the pain in this world, and the impact of the Fall on each of us. It was a powerful, difficult night, made all the more painful when confronted with a visit tomorrow to a government aftercare home where we’re see the other side of aftercare in Mumbai.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">We covet your prayers.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>Hello Hello, So first off, I apologize for my missed blog yesterday, the group had a very long day and when midnight rolled around, I figured my experiences could wait until tomorrow. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I’ll have to admit, that I’m not much of a kid person. I don’t necessarily feel at ease taking care of groups of children or getting down on their level, so when I heard that our group would be hosting a kids camp for the less fortunate youths of Mumbai so they could learn about God and have a day of fun and release from their everyday lives, I wasn’t really sure how I would be able to grasp the whole experience. Then, going into the single room that would eventually house nearly 100 young kids, once again I’ll admit I was a bit nervous and reserved on what was to come. Soon after, the children entered and we all were greeted with some heartfelt smiles and plenty of handshakes. We commenced the games and activities that some of our group had planned, and judging by the looks on the kids faces, mixed with the shouts and running around, I’m pretty sure they were enjoying it. The Crossroads group had set up several stations of activities, including jump rope, origami, dancing, a giant parachute and coloring (my group). The children were all absolutely beautiful and we were constantly kept busy with their requests for pictures or to simply just give them any form of attention that we could provide. Several of them made a point to stand out, whether through having us hold them, by their dance moves, or the fact that they were just undoubtedly adorable. Like Andrew said, I think there was a bag check on the way out to make sure nobody was sneaking any kids home with them.  </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Coming into this trip, I had an idea in my mind that we would mainly be focused on working with the girls who have been rescued and put in the aftercare homes, and I feel that it might be safe to say that many coming with me probably felt the same. So when we set out for a long drive at seven this morning, to an Indian "beach resort", I was curious to what the point of this endeavor might be. We’re here to change lives, right? Well as I sit here now in the lobby of our hotel, after living through the long day that was today, I can say to you all, the whole Crossroads community, that though they are numero uno on our priority list, this trip is about so much more than just the girls in the homes. Today we were allowed the pleasure of hosting a day of relaxation for the pastors of the Baptist Society, who work tirelessly around the clock being the pastor of their individual churches, while bringing new members to God, caring for the sick in their neighborhoods, and also doing this little old thing of spreading the word about human trafficking and the circumstances that these girls face. Needless to say they have little time set aside strictly for their own families, and definitely no time to go somewhere and ever enjoy some peace for themselves, and that’s where Crossroads and our group comes in. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>We all met at a wonderful retreat near the coast of the Arabian sea, and though everyone’s shy side was showing at first, the Pastors (with their beautiful families) soon became spread out with our group and we were all sitting down for a morning of worship and prayer before lunch and some activities in the afternoon. The pastor that I sat with was Pastor Pravin, who had his wife and son and daughter with him ( I’m very sorry I don’t remember their names, still adjusting to India I’m afraid) and a young girl he had accepted into his family that had been diagnosed with HIV. Together, we all conversed as the pastor translated for us, and after quite some time, I went off to play with his daughter and her new small present from the Crossroads team (Bubbles. Every child in the world loves blowing bubbles). Lunch was soon eaten under the shade of palm trees, but not before I was taught how to play cricket on the shores of the Arabian. Afterwards, the adults became children for the first time in years as we all went about giving the pastors some much needed recreation time. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>After talking to some of my fellow Crossroadians, I was told that some of the pastors had admitted to never coming to the sea before, and the majority of them admitted to never ever having a day where they as a whole family had gone on a trip anywhere. It is typically not common to see an Indian woman running around, smiling and having fun, especially when they have a six month old baby, but thanks to our wonderful mothers on the team who have admitted to having "baby withdrawal", the Indian women were given a chance to eat their lunch for the first time in peace and play games along with the men. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I had another one of those moments today, in between playing soccer with the youths and packing up for our drive home, a moment where I had to take a step back and look around at what all was going on. Today, at this time, I realized that what Crossroads is doing for the girls in the homes is amazing, but at the same time they are also building relationships and strengthening not only their ties in India, but India as a whole. Those men, women, and children around me these last two days will probably never have anywhere near the life that I have, or any of the chances that I have on any given day in America, and I realize that I have done absolutely nothing to deserve being so blessed with what I have, and for these past two days, outside of the aftercare homes, we as a group were able to give something back to the people that we feel deserve it. We were given a chance to bless the pastors, their families, and the children of the city in our own ways, much to the delight and thanks of those around. These are the real people on the front lines over here Crossroads, and though we come from opposite sides of the world and completely different social or economic backgrounds, we’re all joined by one God, no matter where he put us in the world, and we must not forget those that are working so hard for these girls. Mumbai is not just simply a spot on the map anymore, a city where we land our plane to visit aftercare homes (though like I said, the girls are our first priority), through these tireless pastors and their families and all the sacrifice they make, Mumbai is more of Crossroads-East, and these people are our family.</em></p>
