<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodnews: Patience</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue this week to look at a story from the book of John that shows Jesus engaging us in our broken places.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:2-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 8:2-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Greek word grapho that has been translated here in verses 6 and 8 can have two meanings: to write with a focus on the way you write, as in beauty of the letters (think calligraphy), or to write with the focus on content, as if recording something (think transcribe). So, Jesus either created art in the dust or he made a list. Many scholars believe that He transcribed the sins of the religious types who had brought the woman to be condemned, which lines up with his statement. If so, what beautiful patience Jesus had in choosing to do that quietly in writing instead of pointing a finger--even though he was surrounded by pointers.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take time today to make a list of things Jesus could have written in the dust about you. Keep it, you will need it tomorrow.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 9</a></p>
