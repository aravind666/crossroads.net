<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The first two of the three servants find ways to multiply the money that was put in the care of their management. The investors response? He rewarded them by bringing them fully into his business, not as a servant or employee, but as a partner. Since, most businesses at this time were family businesses, this is equivalent to being called a son or daughter. As a member of the family, we no longer function in investing what is on loan to us for the benefit of the boss, we receive full benefits and profits. God created and is the rightful owner of everything, there is a lot to gain as the bottom line profit.</p>
