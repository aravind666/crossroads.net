<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RHETTS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Remember Rhett? He specifically heard God tell him to ask his family for forgiveness. When he did, his parents forgave him without a moments hesitation. And soon after, Rhett witnessed something he thought would never happen: "My dad specifically repented and asked for my forgiveness for different things throughout my childhood. Walls broke. Generational walls broke, crumbled. God just blew me away."</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God restored Rhetts family, but that wasnt all.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">"Three months after the amazing night of repentance and restoration with my dad, my 85-year-old grandfather ushered in a whole new level of generational restoration and intimacy like only a wise, gray-haired patriarch can. He gave up comfort. He gave up pride. He risked relationships. He quite simply did the most epic thing anyone can do... he obeyed.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Obedience is the single most effective way to be a part of the expansion of Gods Kingdom. We listen for our Papas voice and follow. So often I dont do this and I wonder why I feel alone and purposeless. But, when I obey and continue in obedience the harvest arrives bountifully."</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Rhetts family was restored when he, his dad and grandfather obeyed. Its not always the easiest route, but he knows that when he submits to his Dad, the King, there is some really good stuff on the other side. Take a look at <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001u_JEbrwJJ831MTqr2kwbkZWcwoyxUXD0BMhflQeyIOw_iBW0PPEkTcIPU__tpQzZvAwsCaG_zUSOKfN-YQAcDpyGgyuBtcWIH1f0iv47gJej9oVi4JLnopdYBTy-8H-_DgEywKeiFIWqPZh81_xAka7kTicdaWiyyiPgn19MGKDc5Ok5kIegSUDfvihZIpHKrTAYzVznHF3gixbTUvgs0A==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Isaiah 1:19</a>.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Maybe theres someone you need to forgive. If someone came to mind, go on and write them a note, give an old-fashioned phone call or meet them face-to-face. Forgiveness is a big step of obedience and the Kingdom of God moves when you take that step.</p>
