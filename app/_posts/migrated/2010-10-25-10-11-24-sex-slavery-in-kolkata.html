<p class="noPspace"> You may have heard stories and seen pictures from Mumbai, India, where Crossroads has  been partnering with <a href="" target="_blank">International  Justice Mission</a>  (IJM) for several years to rescue and rehabilitate victims of forced prostitution. But as a part of the Game Change campaign, we’re broadening our  efforts to include Kolkata,  another Indian city which is sometimes called Calcutta (similar to how Mumbai is often called Bombay). </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">For three-and-a- half years, I led the IJM field office to combat sex trafficking of children in Calcutta (see previous <a href="/india/2010/09/17/10-54-50-justice-is-a-beautiful-thing.html" target="_blank">blog</a>) before coming on staff with Crossroads.  Of note, 42% of the Indian girls whom IJM has rescued in Mumbai are from West   Bengal, the state in which Calcutta is the capital.  Here is a <a href="/india/2010/09/17/10-54-50-justice-is-a-beautiful-thing.html" target="_blank">link</a> to a news piece on an investigative, undercover video negotiating prices  for 11-year-old girls in Calcutta.  (The CNN video begins with a short advertisement, then two short clips follow.)</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">These stories represent thousands of women and girls in the flesh trade in Songachi, India’s largest red-light  area. These stories represent the girls we are going to rescue through the Game Change campaign.</p>
