<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;You may have heard stories and seen pictures from Mumbai, India, where Crossroads has  been partnering with <a href="http://www.ijm.org/" target="_blank">International  Justice Mission</a>&nbsp; (IJM) for several years to rescue and rehabilitate victims of forced prostitution. But as a part of the Game Change campaign, we&rsquo;re broadening our  efforts to include Kolkata,&nbsp; another Indian city which is sometimes called Calcutta (similar to how Mumbai is often called Bombay).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">For three-and-a- half years, I led the IJM field office to combat sex trafficking of children in Calcutta (see previous <a href="/blog/view/5/34" target="_blank">blog</a>) before coming on staff with Crossroads.&nbsp; Of note, 42% of the Indian girls whom IJM has rescued in Mumbai are from West   Bengal, the state in which Calcutta is the capital. &nbsp;Here is a <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/nations-shame-pimps-on-prowl-minors-on-sale/54532-5-single.html" target="_blank">link</a> to a news piece on an investigative, undercover video negotiating prices  for 11-year-old girls in Calcutta.&nbsp; (The CNN video begins with a short advertisement, then two short clips follow.)</p>

<p class="noPspace">These stories represent thousands of women and girls in the flesh trade in Songachi, India&rsquo;s largest red-light  area. These stories represent the girls we are going to rescue through the Game Change campaign.</p>
