<p><strong>Week Two: The Life of Jesus</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, February 28</strong></p>
<p>Catch of the Day</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to be faithful to you, even when what youre asking feels crazy.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Luke 5: 1-11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%205:%201-11&amp;version=NIV">Luke 5:1-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Fishing for these guys wasnt the aluminum boat, beers-in-a-cooler kind of fishing. It was more like TLCs Deadliest Catch. These men worked all through the night, throwing heavy nets overboard, letting them sink, pulling them back up again. All night long, and not a fish to show for it. Imagine the bitter exhaustion, the feeling of defeat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Morning comes, and as the guys are finally cleaning up and getting ready to head home for a bowl of Wheaties, Jesus shows up. He gets in a boat, talks to the crowd, and then tells the guys to go back out into the water and let their nets down again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Put yourself in Simons place, and imagine that moment. How would you have really responded? Obviously there was something about Jesus presence that made Simon get over his tiredness and everything he knew about fish behavior. How would you describe it?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Many times in life, God comes to us with requests that defy all sense and logicrequests that fly in the face of our experience and all we know to be true. Think back to one of those times in your life, and spend a few minutes talking with God about what it felt like and why you responded the way you did. Or answer this: What situations are you currently facing that require a Simon-like response?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>

<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 15" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2015&amp;version=NIV">Acts 15</a></p>
