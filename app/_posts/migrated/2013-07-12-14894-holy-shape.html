<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Holy: Shape</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at a portion of Romans 8 this week, and contemplate how holy God is, and how he wants to invite us into that holiness.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:29-30&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:29-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If God is holy and we are not, then he cannot accept us into himself without receiving imperfections which would lessen his holiness. So instead, because hes awesome, he did the work to make us holy. Jesus died on the cross to pay atonement for all of the things that separate us from God. But Jesus didnt just die, he came back to life. And He does the same with all of our unholiness--he resurrects and remakes us. He continues to form us into the very image of his perfect son.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Doodle the outline of a person (you) into your journal. What would it take to press your image more toward the image of Christ? Draw lines off of the outline and jot down the ways that you want God to press you more toward Christs likeness.</p>
