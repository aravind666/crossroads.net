<p>Embracing the tension of toil</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:16-22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 3:16-22</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many of us are taught the same lesson from an early age: work hard, always strive for something better, and youll eventually reach a magic, happy point of ultimate success where we can relax and enjoy the fruits of our labor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays passage tackles the tension of work. Solomon makes a straightforward argument here: the world contains injustice and wickedness that we cant control. Its Gods reminder that were a small part of a much bigger plan. But God judges both good and bad in his own time, so it makes sense that we should embrace the tension between the frustrations of working in an unjust world and the joy of knowing were fulfilling our unique roles in Gods great master plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Misdirected ambition, whether in our careers or our lifes work to make the world better, can overwhelm us and leave us frustrated, bitter and with a sense of incompetence. Embracing the tension and limits of our control, however, opens a valuable door: we gain comfort and understanding that God is in control and hell make clear our role in the big picture.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think about the happiest, most content person youve ever met, and answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you ask that person what he or she does, does the conversation revolve around a job or does it focus on a bigger life mission?</li>
<li>Does the person talk more about his or her career, or about his or her family?</li>
<li>Is the person materially wealthy?</li>
<li>What is the person known for: holding a powerful position, making a huge salary or creating change that makes the world better, safer or more beautiful?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Reflect on how this persons answers are similar to or different from your own. What does that tell you about how you embrace the tension of toil?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong> <br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 7</a></p>
