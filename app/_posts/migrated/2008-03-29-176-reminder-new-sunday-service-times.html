<html><body><p>I was talking to a good friend who asked me which Saturday service I was attending. So, I thought it was worth reiterating that there are <strong>new </strong>Sunday service times at 8:45am, 10:30am and 12:30pm, but Saturday service is still at 5:30pm, and there is just one. If you were planning on attending a 4:30pm service today in advance of the 6:40pm Xavier vs. UCLA tip-off, you might want to restrategize. (I'm planning on going tonight and missing the first few minutes.)<br> </p></body></html>
