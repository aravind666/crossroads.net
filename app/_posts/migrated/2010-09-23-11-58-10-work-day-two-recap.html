<p class="normal noPspace">With a team of 40 volunteers from <a title="OneSight" href="http://www.onesight.org">OneSigh</a>t, another 15 volunteers from Crossroads and more than 100 volunteers from Charity &amp; Faith, a massive free eye clinic for the  people of Mamelodi is underway.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">For the past few weeks, the volunteers at Charity &amp; Faith distributed more than 10,000 free appointment cards (tickets) for the two-week  OneSight event.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">The first day was set up and training. The next day (our first work day) we hit the ground running and eased into our rhythm while  helping over 700 patients!  Today (work day two), we doubled that number and helped 1404 people without normal access to eye care.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"><strong>Some  cool things to note: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="normal">Four patients had simple eye infections that, left untreated, would have led to total blindness. We cured those patients.</li>
<li class="normal">Because of the infrastructure Crossroads already developed in Mamelodi, nearly 70 people were able to be referred to additional levels of care  that would be impossible at most OneSight clinics (in other places around the world).</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal noPspace">For many patients, this is the first time that they have ever encountered quality  eye care. They enter functionally blind but leave with crystal clear  site. Truly amazing!</p>
