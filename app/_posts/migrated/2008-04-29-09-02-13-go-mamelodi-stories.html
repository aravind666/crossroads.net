<img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/GO_Mame_Cast_1.gif\" alt=\"GO Mamelodi\" hspace=\"5\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" align=\"right\" />Each year for the past two years Crossroads has sent <strong>hundreds</strong> (yes...that is <em>hundreds</em>) of people to the township of <strong>Mamelodi, South Africa</strong>
to partner with Charity and Faith Mission Church in bringing hope and
healing to Mamelodi. While there they built houses, planted gardens,
cared for kids and built relationships. <strong>And guess what... we're</strong> <a href=\"../gomamelodi\">going back again this year</a>. <br /><br />In
this series of podcasts, we'll be learning what happens when everyday,
normal Crossroads people make the decision to engage their world.<br /><br /><strong>Episode One&#58; Jeff and Tiffany</strong><br /><a href=\"../images/uploadedimages/gomamelodi/podcasts/Mamelodi-Jeff-Tiffany.mp3\">Download</a> (right-click and Save-As)<br /><br /><strong>Episode Two&#58; Nate and Jason</strong><br /><a href=\"../images/uploadedimages/gomamelodi/podcasts/Mamelodi-Nate-Jason.mp3\">Download</a> (right-click and Save-As)<br /><br /><strong>Episode Three&#58; Derek Hunter</strong><br /><a href=\"../images/uploadedimages/gomamelodi/podcasts/Mamelodi-Derek-Hunter.mp3\">Download</a> (right-click and Save-As)<br /><br /><strong>Episode Four&#58; Greg Rosenau</strong><br />
