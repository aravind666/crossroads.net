<p class="noPspace"><strong>Move: Doors Open</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to look at Paul in Athens as an example of how to move in our faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">As Paul began to share how Jesus had changed his life, there was a response from the people of Athens. The first response was that Paul was mocked: called a babbler and an advocate for foreign Gods.Paul doesnt let mocking sway him or his passion for the Athenians. Then, out of nowhere, they give him an opportunity to come before the Areopagus, some of the most influential folks in the city. A door opened.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Today and the rest of this week, begin to look for open doors or opportunities to talk about God with someone. Make a list of people with whom you would like to have doors open. You may or may not be mocked like Paul, so remember to value authenticity.If you are not a Christ-follower, but are reading the daily; youre not off the hook. You can still look for opportunities to talk about the journey you are on.</p>
