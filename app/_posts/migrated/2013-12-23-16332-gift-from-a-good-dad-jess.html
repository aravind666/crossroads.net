<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JESS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I was convinced and believed the lie that I would have a really hard time conceiving children and becoming a mom. My friend heard from God and told me I would be healed and have children, yet I still doubted.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">My husband and I tried to conceive for many months but nothing happened. Finally, I repented to others and asked Gods forgiveness for believing the lies and that God would never choose to heal me. A few weeks later I found out I was pregnant.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We now have a beautiful baby girl and another one on the way. I felt in my heart all along that God had created me with purpose and one of those purposes was to be a mom. Now I know that was a promise from God, and he had always intended to keep it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Let Jess story be a reminder of our Saviors unexpected birth. With your family and friends or just one-on-one, thank your Dad for the best gift of all: a rescuer.</p>
