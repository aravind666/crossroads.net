<p class="noPspace"><strong>Long Awaited: The Plan</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">The season leading up to Christmas is sometimes called Advent. Over the next four weeks, The Daily will not only partner with the weekend teaching, it will also look at elements that are normally celebrated during Advent. This weeks focus: hope. Feel free to light a candle this week to remember the role of hope in the story of Christmas, and in your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">From the moment that Adam and Eve walked away from trusting God, he began a plan to redeem. This verse in Genesis captures the words that God spoke to the serpent. He is speaking of a forthcoming event and person. The serpent may have the power to nip at our heels, but Christ has crushed his head. There is a longing that begins in the human race right at this moment for the One who was to come, Jesus. Jesus is hope, and he holds the ability to conquer death (the serpent) and to restore us.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This week we are looking at longing or hope. Write in your journal today about something that you spent time looking forward to in your life (something for which you had to wait).</p>
