<html><body><p class="noPspace">Last weekend, we shared the incredible Beans &amp; Rice Week results. Even if you were there, it’s worth saying all over again. We raised $377,036.06 in the span of seven days! Just by rearranging our eating habits! Amazing. This blew away our staff’s guesses. This blew away the expectations of our partner organizations. Well done, team. Well done.</p></body></html>
