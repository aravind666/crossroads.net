<strong>No matter the forecast, no matter the accumulation, we're delivering Angel Tree gifts tomorrow morning (Saturday, December 19), snow or shine.</strong> If you've signed up to deliver gifts, please arrive at Crossroads Oakley based on this schedule:<br><ul>
<li>Whiz Kids pre-arranged deliveries: 10:00am</li>
<li>Last name A-H: 10:30am</li>
<li>Last name I-P: 11:00am</li>
<li>Last name Q-Z: 11:30am</li>
</ul>Please use the West Entrance only. If you're on your own, we'll pair you up (we must have at least 2 people on each delivery team). You'll hear a brief orientation about what to expect when you're delivering, receive your gifts and map and then be on your way. Most deliveries take an hour or so.</body></html>
