<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Spiritual Parents: Imitators</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its not about individualism--we are all part of a spiritual family. This week were exploring spiritual parenting, and today we add verses 15 and 16.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:14-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 4:14-16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul is writing to the community of believers that he fathered in Corinth and sharing the good news of Jesus. At some point in your life you have imitated someone. You may have learned a new job or skill through imitating, or you may have just liked someone elses style and imitated it. Imitation is not a dirty word, especially when we look to find spiritual parents who have good spiritual habits and practices in their lives. Our goal as believers is to be matured, and then in our maturity, to parent others.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write today about what in your life is worthy of imitating.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5</a></p>
