<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>*(But were afraid to ask.)</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Hi. I&rsquo;m Mark and I&rsquo;m a volunteer. For the last two years, I&rsquo;ve helped with writing and posting India blog entries, and have even done graphic design work for the India team. This month, I finally decided it was time to actually step out of the boat (and get on a plane) and GO to India. Oddly enough, this wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision for me. Suspecting that I may not be the only one with a heart for India with reservations about GO-ing, I&rsquo;ve decided to share some of what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last few months in hopes that it might encourage you.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;<br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Reservation #1&#58;</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em><strong>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m uniquely qualified to really help someone who is a survivor of sex trafficking. What can I really do to help?</strong></em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Many of my fellow volunteers have been on GO India trips. Despite their constant reassurance that each person on each trip makes a significant difference, and that their particular skill sets weren&rsquo;t any more &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; than mine, it wasn&rsquo;t until the recent visit from Crossroads&rsquo; partners, Keith and Ramona Dsouza, that it really sunk in for me. Ramona&rsquo;s insight was very simple and resoundingly clear&#58; &ldquo;By just making the sacrifice to be here, you&rsquo;re helping these girls understand their worth.&rdquo; She pointed out that while we won&rsquo;t be digging wells or moving cinderblocks, the moments of sharing prayer, a simple conversation, or even the latest dance (still questioning my qualifications in this area) are all ways to help build into them. Keith also pointed out that each trip offers different kinds of opportunities. For example, sometimes trips involve taking Crossover staff, Indian church partners, or women living in the aftercare homes on retreats. You could end up passing out sheets of paper, facilitating group discussions, getting conversations started, or just making events run smoothly. Serving those who spend most of their lives serving others (or haven&rsquo;t been served much before) makes a huge impact. The moral of the story is&#58; every person will contribute something meaningful on a GO trip no matter what skills, talents, background or level of extrovertedness (fairly certain I won&rsquo;t be teaching grammar) they have.</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Reservation #2&#58;</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em><strong>I&rsquo;m a guy, and I know these women have had horrible experiences with men in their lives. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d much rather have female visitors.</strong></em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The answer to this one was a bit of a &ldquo;duh&rdquo; moment for me as it was so logical. It&rsquo;s because these young women have had horrible experiences with men that it is so important for men to GO on these trips; for them to see men who reflect God&rsquo;s love and see themselves as the person He created them to be. Rick June, a past GO India trip participant, shared this insight&#58; &ldquo;The presence of men in this ministry is really important to achieve. I found Crossover Foundation staff&mdash;especially women&mdash;were appreciative that their work is valued by men. They experience so many negative images of men in their work, so seeing godly men willing to sacrifice time and energy for their support and growth is an encouragement.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><em><strong>My exposure to and understanding of Indian culture has been limited to my (frequent) visits to a local buffet restaurant. I&rsquo;m going to have some serious culture shock.</strong></em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">This answer has two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uh, yeah. Isn&rsquo;t that part of why you&rsquo;re signing up? Isn&rsquo;t that part of the adventure? I&rsquo;m being called to experience God in new way, and doing so may require me to get a little out of my comfort zone. He died for me... yeah, I think I&rsquo;m good with a little &ldquo;discomfort&rdquo;!</li>
<li>That being said, Crossroads prepares you out the wazoo (technical term) for these trips. In addition to a packet of materials and guidance on how to raise financial support, you&rsquo;ll be invited to three or four pre-trip meetings where they&rsquo;ll talk about culture and travel logistics, and plan on-the-ground activities. They promise they won&rsquo;t throw you into the deep end, abandon you in a crowded market, or force you to find your way across Mumbai with 15 rupees and the name of your hotel.</li>
</ol>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Speaking of preparation, I&rsquo;m sure some of you have lots of other questions, so we created <a href=\"https&#58;//www.dropbox.com/s/xjkcclhx14fvf03/GoIndiaSpecializedFAQ12%20REV.pdf\">this handy Frequently Asked Questions sheet</a> for you. Above all, pray about it. If God&rsquo;s nudging you toward this but you don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll scrape the money together, you&rsquo;re in good company. Maybe you&rsquo;ll take a leap of faith and join us this October, maybe you&rsquo;ll decide to go on another trip further down the road, or maybe you&rsquo;ll decide to do something else to get involved. Either way, I encourage you to get out of the boat with me and go be the church. Ready to GO?
