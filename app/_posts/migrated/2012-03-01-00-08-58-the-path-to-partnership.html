<p class="noPspace">For those of you who follow our blogs, you know <a href="/blog/view/5/113">how instrumental the local churches in India are</a> in our battle to fight forced prostitution in India. Crossover Foundation has been Crossroads&rsquo; feet on the ground to inform and engage the local church community to build a sustainable aftercare infrastructure in India. Finding the right partner churches requires a concerted effort. Crossroads Justice Director Don Gerred notes, &ldquo;Churches we want to partner with have to be able to count the costs and be in this for the long term. We&rsquo;re looking for quality and that means building relationships where we can address gaps in order to help that church become the best they can be in providing aftercare.&rdquo; Crossover has established partnerships with Maharashtra Baptist Society (MBS) and New India Church of God&rsquo;s Vision Rescue Foundation, and is in discussions with the Free Methodist Church and Good News Church.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">The churches are initially engaged in providing independent witnesses to go on brothel rescues and testify against perpetrators, and volunteering in existing aftercare homes with Crossover&rsquo;s guidance. Once a church <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:26" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>commits to partnership, Crossover Foundation works alongside them to locate property and transform it into a home where young women can rehabilitate from the trauma of trafficking, and consults with them in the process of hiring staff to administer the home. Crossover Foundation serves as a pillar of support for these churches&mdash;preparing them, guiding them and encouraging them as they work toward operating quality homes independently. The Crossroads team also provides leadership training and guidance in building a stewardship infrastructure that will allow for sustainable growth. In order to start the process of opening and operating a transition home, a church partner signs an agreement called a Memo of Understanding (MOU) with Crossover and Crossroads. Essentially, the church provides a facility<del datetime="2012-02-21T11:27" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del><del datetime="2012-02-21T11:26" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>, 20% of the operating costs and direct oversight and management of the home.<del datetime="2012-02-21T11:27" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del> Crossover Foundation then serves as an operational consultant to set up standards of care and provide training<del datetime="2012-02-21T11:27" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>. Crossroads provides the remaining <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:28" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>operating costs&mdash;part of our Game Change contributions.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">After the July 2011 Crossroads GO Trips that focused on building into the pastors, women and youth of the MBS, the church leaders made the decision to partner with Crossover to open a transition home for survivors of sex trafficking. On January 24, Crossover Foundation and MBS inaugurated their first transition home in Mumbai, Jeevan Aadhar Kendra (Life Sustaining Centre). This will eventually be a home for young women who have aged out of government and private aftercare homes to receive further rehabilitative therapy and counseling, as well as <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:28" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>job and life-skills training in community with the members of MBS. The goal is to provide the women transitional care for approximately two years and then encourage them to live in group homes, the next stage on their path to independence and reintegration.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">While we have furnished facilities for two transition homes, acquiring the operational licensing takes time. &ldquo;What takes one unit of effort in the US, takes five in Mumbai,&rdquo; Gerred explains. &ldquo;There are so many <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:29" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>details to navigate<del datetime="2012-02-21T11:29" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>, especially <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:29" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>for new organizations like these. This is just the beginning. The work is hard and slow, but we&rsquo;re in this for the long haul.<del datetime="2012-02-21T11:30" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">In Mark 11:20-25, Jesus reminds his disciples to have faith in God<del datetime="2012-02-21T11:32" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>, and believe <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:32" cite="mailto:Crossroads"></del>they will receive whatever they ask for in prayer. We urge you to pray for licensure so we can take young women into these transition homes, for more dedicated church partners and for continued progress in our efforts in India.</p><p class="noPspace"><em><strong>New to our blog?
