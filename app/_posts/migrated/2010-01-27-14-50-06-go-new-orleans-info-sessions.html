<p>We&rsquo;re going back to New Orleans this summer. God calls us to help those in need, and we're planning to do everything we can to be a blessing. This summer, we'll send 400 people to New Orleans (in two trips of 200 each).</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 is <strong>July 10-18</strong>
</li>
<li>Week 2 is <strong>July 17-25</strong>
</li>
</ul>
