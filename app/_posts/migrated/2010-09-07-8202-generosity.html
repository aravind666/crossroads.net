<p>Generosity</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a few minutes to ask God to show you what it means to be generous.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:45&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:45</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Theres nothing saying that in order to be generous, you have to sell all of your stuff and live like a monk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The early churchs generosity was rooted in love. It was their abundance of love that enabled them to share everything they had with each other. The early believers knew they hadnt joined an organization, but had actually become part of a new family--and a new life. So their generosity wasnt about guilt, indebtedness or rules. Rather, their generosity was a natural expression of the gratitude they felt for the love poured out by Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being generous isnt about the number of dollars you give away; its about the spirit of love.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write down a way that you can be generous with someone else. Then, make a plan and do it.</p>
