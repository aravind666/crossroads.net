<p>The Through-Line</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend some time thanking God for his unconditional, complete love for you. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108782106963&amp;s=0&amp;e=001UPT-kRSoUz93FvSLKLGDpMpEi59xjvQvipJwkGuMsZebuB4H3CaaOr_iYeAGh4pTSEnP4fxxIeP0RRDQu5aZlz7dQsq7o5uruHaoOIcxW0lIw06ReTBoyKtThyJN-X5P-r2tmzCtrQDoTIcjBJ0bfaaIpuYTfp__VN_hsVOyjqAIw1H_2r8CKZPdMhmehYMWA5PxHwxN_qWSRjTzoYEtzw==" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:4-9</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Getting rescued isnt an everyday experience for most of us. In fact, we might even feel more comfortable being the rescuer (i.e. project manager) because we get more control over the situation, and its more predictable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But  the through-line of Gods story is redemption. God alone does the  rescuing and the saving. And He does it out of love, not because he  expects us to return the favor. We cant. ("And this not from  yourselves, it is the gift of God," Ephesians 2:8.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we get to surrender our striving efforts and know that His love doesnt come with a dimmer switch. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If  someone offers to help you with something today, take them up on it  (even if you think you could do it better). If no one offers, ask for  help.</p>
<p></p>
