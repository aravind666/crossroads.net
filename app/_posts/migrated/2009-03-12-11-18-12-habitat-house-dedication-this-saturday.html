Two hundred and twenty-one volunteers from Crossroads logged more than 5000 hours rehabilitating a foreclosure property to provide Austino Lewis and Kama Quaye, along with their two young sons James and Jeffrey, with a new home. The Lewis-Quaye family had lived in tents and makeshift housing in Ghana for the last 15 years escaping civil unrest in their native Liberia, until now.Â  Learn more about the dedication <a href="/" title="Habitat Blog link">here.</a>
