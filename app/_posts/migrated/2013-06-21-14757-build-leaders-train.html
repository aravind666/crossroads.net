<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In situations where we cannot see the end result, we can get anxious, scared or are not able to be fully present. Situations like these are great opportunities to be trained by God to trust in him. If you allow yourself to trust God, that allows you to experience Gods trust in you. Its a two-way street. God always wants to train and build leadership skills in you to expand his kingdom. Pursue God in the unsure times.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about the things in your life of which you are unsure. It may seem scary that you cant see an end result. Then pray to God, God I trust you in this situation and I believe you have my best interest in mind. I am open to be trained and equipped by you. I want to learn leadership skills from you. Lead me.</p>
