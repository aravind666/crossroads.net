<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>Friday, April 16<br></strong>Self-Control<strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em><br>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2012:1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:1-3</a><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Without self-control, were like a city without walls (Proverbs 25:28).</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">God isnt asking us to control the world or the people around us, but he does want to bring us into a place of self-awareness and healthy disciplines. When we tap into this fruit of His Spirit, we can better deflect the enemy who wants us to live recklessly and fall into bad habits.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><br>Yet, our self-control isnt a result of our own strength. Its an outpouring of Gods Spirit--and this is why it sustains, grows and can spread into the lives of the people around us.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">What words of encouragement does Paul give us to help us use self-control? By what means does he say we can start to accomplish this? <strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Peter%205:8-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 5:8-10<br></a></p>

<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em></em></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the week's content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">God gives his Spirit to us when we accept Jesus. And this starts our spiritual transformation into His very image. Receiving and bearing the fruit of the Spirit includes everything from surrender to overcoming, from learning to teaching, from being the gospel to receiving the gospel. They all bring honor to God by declaring the dramatic change we undergo as being a part of Gods family and thus our ability to draw upon him and his power to produce fruit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you see one fruit of the Spirit in your life?</li>
<li>Where do others see this fruit of the Spirit, or another, in your life?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Spend a minute praying for each other and asking God to make you receptive to all of his gifts.</p>
