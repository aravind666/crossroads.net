<p>Obedience Grows Faith</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, soften my heart towards you and your will, and take away my desire to be rebellious.</em></p>

<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Often  when we hear this passage, its in reference to talents or gifts. But  its also about obedience. In any relationship, either with your parents  or a boss or spouse, when you constantly rebel or ignore the other  persons wishes, you tend to butt heads and argue, and your relationship  suffers. But when you are obedient, your relationship strengthens and  their trust in you grows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same is true with God. When you follow through on a prompting from God, more</p>
<p>often than not, you begin hearing him more often and more clearly. When you do</p>
<p>His  will, God trusts you with more. Your obedience allows you to grow  closer to Him, and your faith naturally increases. Obedience isnt just  the foundation of our faith, it can grow our faith as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  and write down a time when you have rebelled. What led you to rebel?  Was it fear? Laziness? Pride? What happened as a result? Today, look for  opportunities to be obedient. When they appear, say yes to submission  and no to rebellion.</p>
