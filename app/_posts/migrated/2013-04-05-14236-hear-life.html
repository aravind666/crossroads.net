<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Monday, April 8</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will look at a passage in Luke, moving through it a few verses at a time.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:22-23&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Luke 12:22-23</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How much of your day do you spend worrying about what to wear or what to eat? If your life and body are more important, according to Jesus teaching, how much time do you spend listening for your Fathers voice about how he views you holistically? Listening for Gods voice calms our worry, and reorients our focus. Listen, he wants to affirm your value.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have a journal dialogue with God. Ask God how he views you, and then write his response. (take a risk and try this without judgment or doubting whether God said it , just try it)</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 11</a></p>
