to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we
saw that Jesus was engaged with the culture around him and how we are also called to engage right where we are. <br><br>In case you missed the service, you can <a href="/messages/2008-08-17-vision.html">watch</a> (including the Bono video) or <a href="/my/media/playMedia.php?idMedia=580">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/documents/StudyNotes4.13.08.pdf">Study Notes</a> (PDF).<br><br>This coming weekend, Brian Tome will be talking about how Jesus was surrendered to his mission.</body></html>
