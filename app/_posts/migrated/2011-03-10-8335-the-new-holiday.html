<p>The New Holiday</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for sacrificing yourself for me. Help me see the significance of that act.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Exodus 12:1-7" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2012:1-7&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 12:1-7</a>, <a title="Bible Gateway Exodus 12:23-27" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2012:23-27&amp;version=NIV">23-27</a>; <a title="bible gateway Matthew 26:17-30" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:17-30&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 26:17-30</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>About two thousand years before Jesus came along, Israel was enslaved to Egypt. So God sent a whole series of intense and gruesome plagues to convince the king of Egypt to free the Israelites. This culminated in God claiming the life of every firstborn in Egypt who wasnt covered by a sign of Gods choosing. Basically, you had to kill a lamb and paint the blood on the doorposts and God would pass over that house.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every year, the Israelites had a Passover meal to celebrate how God rescued themand the sacrifice it required. A weighty tradition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet Jesus radically changes this tradition. He replaces the lamb; he is the sacrifice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a hard time believing that God sees you as valuable enough to sacrifice for? If so, youre not alone. But consider why it might be hard for you to accept that level of sacrifice, and have a conversation with God about it. When youre finished, read <a title="Bible Gateway ephesians 1:4-5" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:4-5&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 1:4-5.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 23" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2023&amp;version=NIV">Acts 23</a></p>
