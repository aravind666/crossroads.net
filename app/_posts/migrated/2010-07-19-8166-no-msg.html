<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Give us this day, our daily bread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Praying this line of the Lords Prayer confirms in us that it is God who meets our everyday needs. This should inspire us to be thankful for the good things we receive. Its also a call to something morebecause most of us receive more than daily provisions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We spent last week asking God to bring his kingdom to us and the world and to make his will know in us and through us. What do you think Gods will is when we receive an abundance of daily bread?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another interesting facet of this prayer is that there arent preservatives. Its strictly in the present. This day. It doesnt say, Give us today our yearly salary and bonus. We are invited to enter into the kingdom every day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What are you depending on God for today?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Thank God for meeting your needs today and ask for his will to be done with the abundance youve been given, so that his kingdom may come to you and others.</p>
