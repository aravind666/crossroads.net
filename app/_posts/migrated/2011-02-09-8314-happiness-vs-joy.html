<p><strong>Wednesday, February 9 </strong><br>Happiness vs. Joy</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God orient my heart towards you as my source for joy.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Were pretty familiar with happinessafter all, our country was founded on the pursuit of it. We buy stuff and cling to relationships to get it, take trips and risks hoping to find it, and might toss away years worth of work because we dont have it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But joy?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this Psalm, David says that God has given him a joy far greater than anything that mere stuffor mere happinesscan provide. People around him are begging for better times, yet David seeks the presence of God himself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Which do you seek: happiness or joy?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes to write a short list of things in your life that bring you happiness. (Just a handful.) Then write a list of reasons that you have joy. Why do you think its easier for you to rely on the first list than the second?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT<br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 2" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&amp;version=NIV">Acts 2</a></p>
