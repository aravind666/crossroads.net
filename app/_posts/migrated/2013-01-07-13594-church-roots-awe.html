<p class="noPspace"><strong>Church Roots: Awe</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We are continuing to look at the beginning of the Church this week based on Acts 2. Today, put your focus on verse 43.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0015JnsaWqGWp6wUEdcGkan31Xvx-PG4_gCPny2pPT6LLb5LtSLaUzeGV0T9ckdZo2Gj8JGBafZ-2_ax5evwN0ZkUsSW9W-ZCHZUgHGDUZ1GqBFh18ZFAJGfz-DYGvtyNsjzjmoUjaMT55DwpLhnOPI4EfjY63gm-u1Jrr2jaAAmW2FlcHn_2LQ-XW_UEEZZFIjtzmSMIrvfTIBQBSKZAbPFQ==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yesterday we looked at how the church started. There was teaching, eating together, hanging out together and praying. Thats a good start, but it really gets good when that moves into awe. A community unified by awe looks like one that is: inspired, united, on mission.</p>

<p class="noPspace">If you read on and thought:yeah, but Im not an apostle,lets define that. The disciples were pretty rag-tag guys that Jesus chose. He trained them as disciples and then sent them out to create more community. Disciples become apostles when they are sent or start something new. If you are a believer and are receiving good teaching, you are a disciple. If you start a group at your house or lead something, you are an apostle.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Whatever you are (or call yourself), lets start with more awe. Ask God to show you the wonders of how He is at work all around you, and then just be quiet for a few minutes. He might begin to point it out, or He might just adjust your vision so you can see throughout the day.</p>
