<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>ANDREWS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I lived out of fear, always afraid of making a wrong decision that I believed would screw up my life from here on out. This fear ate me up, kept me from making any decision at all and experiencing the goodness that God had planned for me. Especially when it came to my job.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">My previous job was a high-stress workplace that demanded all of my time and emotions, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. It was exhausting. I had other offers in front of me with less stress and better hours, but I refused to make a decision believing if I did, it could be the wrong one even if I really wanted it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">But God asked me to make a decision, at the same time making it a clear one. Six months into my new gig, I am experiencing Gods love in completely new and unexpected ways. Hes telling me who I am and who he created me to be. While making decisions still isnt easy for me, I lean into my Dad and trust that his plan for me is good.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What might be holding you back from experiencing Gods gifts for you? Spend some time with your Dad today and ask him to make those barriers clear. Trust and receive your Dads love.</p>
