<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">We will be looking this week at a passage that is a part of Jesus Sermon on the Mount, his first large scale teaching. The sermon on the mount is like the inaugural address to let you know what kind of Kingdom Jesus is rolling out. He chooses to address the use of resources, and well be looking at that portion throughout this week.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">The first thing to sit with this week is realizing that you have resources. You have time, energy, finances, relationships, knowledge, and the list goes on. The question is where are you investing what you have. You may have many different kinds of resources, and it may seem like there are endless options for where to invest those resources. But it seems that there are only two paths for where you invest according to Jesus teaching in Matthew: temporary and eternal.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">RESPOND</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Take a moment to make a list of your resources, including time and talents and financial. Dont rush. Ask God to reveal to you resources that didnt come to your mind at first.</span></p>
