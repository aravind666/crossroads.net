<p><strong>Thursday, February 11</strong><br>Faith Through Love</p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ</strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:2-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><br>Galatians 5:2-6</a><strong> </strong><br>(Click to view the scripture online.)<strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong><br>In the Old Testament, God made an agreement (a covenant) with a man named Abraham. Abrahams part of the deal was that he would circumcise himself and all the males in his family as a sign of his faith and of being set apart from the rest of humanity. This tradition continues among the Jewish people to this day.</p>
<p>Although faith in Jesus replaces this outward sign of faith, many in the early church were still practicing rituals like circumcision. It was the way they knew they were in right relationship with God. Paul points out this behavior and tells them circumcision is no longer a measure of faith. The only thing of importance, because of Jesus, is faith expressing itself through love.</p>
<p>Thats a huge difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any ways you are still trusting rituals or religious traditions in order to gain Gods favor or to prove that youre a Christ-follower?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Do something today that expresses faith through love. That could be taking care of yourself by going for a run, or creating a meal from scratch for someone you know. After you do it, consider how you experienced God in the midst of it.</p>
