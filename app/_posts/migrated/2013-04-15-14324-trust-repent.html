<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will be looking at a verse in Isaiah and with the same passage all week while highlighting a different focus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2030:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 30:15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Repentance is a deep layered word, and acting on it fully is an act of trusting God. There are two Hebrew words in the Old Testament translated as repent. One means to feel sorrowful, and the other is to turn or return. The New Testament (written in Greek) has a compound word which literally translates to think differently after.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">All of these together constitute the fullness of the concept of repentance: to pause and feel sorrow for our separation from God, to choose to turn to him and away from a self-focused life, and then to continue to think differently after that moment.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Try this prayer:</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, I repent for (name an action or belief). I feel sorrow for the ways that I have been outside of your best for me. I turn myself toward you alone. Please continue to form my thoughts into your ways, Amen. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 16</a></p>
