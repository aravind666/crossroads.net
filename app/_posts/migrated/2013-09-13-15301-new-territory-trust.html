<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 54:1-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">A barren woman enlarging her tent is an act of trust. This week, as we put ourselves in the role of the woman who God is speaking to, we must listen for Gods voice speaking to us. Active trust starts with active listening, and continues with moving before you have all the details.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, look at what you journaled yesterday, and ask God where he wants to prove you wrong. If you didnt do yesterdays exercise, take time to ask God where he wants to take something that looks dead and bring it new life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
