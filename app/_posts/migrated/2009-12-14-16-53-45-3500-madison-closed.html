Just a reminder that 3500 Madison (Crossroads Oakley) is closed until January 11, except for <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/awaited" title="Awaited: A Christmas Show">Awaited performances</a> (December 17-24) and weekend services in January. We're transforming the Atrium into a winter wonderland (and then we'll need to clean it up after the holidays). Also, please keep in mind that there will be no regular weekend services December 19-20 or 26-27 to give the thousands of volunteers who make this place run a break to spend time with their families.
