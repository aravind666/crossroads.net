<p><strong>Week 1: Minor Prophets</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, September 27</strong></p>
<p>Hosea</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and pray: God, teach me today about your unstoppable love and teach me about ways that I can be faithful.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hosea%203:1-2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hosea 3:1-2</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>For the next couple weeks, were going to look at some words from the Minor Prophetsthose little books at the end of the Old Testament. And all of these prophetic books address three things: words for Gods people at the time when the book was written, words for Gods people always, and a pointing toward Gods coming plan to redeem: Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This story told in the book of Hosea tells of Gods unchangeable love for us. God asked Hosea to marry a prostitute and adulteress. Then even after he married her, she ran away to become a prostitute yet again. But he continued to love and pursue her. We are the bride in this story, selling ourselves short of the true love that God holds for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hosea wrote down Gods words, but only after experiencing Gods heart. He wrote to the Israelite people who were being unfaithful to God by giving themselves away to false idols. He also wrote it for Gods people for all time, as we continue to say we follow God, yet give our heart away.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend a moment in quiet and ask God to reveal to you what has the attention of your heart.</p>
