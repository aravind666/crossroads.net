<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: A Familiar Story</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next few weeks, The Daily will follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you something familiar.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13%3A4-12&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 13:4-12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There are pieces of our story that God will use again. Whether its a family trait, the way we interact with Him or how he intervened to change our life---God will use it again. Just look at Paul (formerly Saul). He was hunting down followers of Jesus and then, bam! The Holy Spirit blinded him and he came to know and follow Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Not too much later, Paul meets a false prophet trying to turn people from their faith in God. Paul is inspired by the Holy Spirit and in the same way intervenes in this mans life, blinding him. We dont know if this guy started following Jesus, but we do know the people with Paul who witnessed this event did.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of something youve struggled with or a trait that everyone in your family shares. How does it feel that God might use it to reach and inspire others?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 11</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 12</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>EAT CHEAPLY, CHANGE THE WORLD</strong></p>
