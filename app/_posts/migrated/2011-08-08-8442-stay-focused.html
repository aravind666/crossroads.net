<p><strong>Week Two: Lessons From Joshua </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, August 8</strong></p>
<p>Stay Focused</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, keep me focused on you and protect me from distraction.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The  Israelites knew this day was coming. Somehow this entire nation was  going to cross the Jordan River at flood stage with everyone intact.  Their instructions were simple: follow the ark of the covenant, the  symbol of Gods power and presence. If the ark turned South, Israel  should turn South. If the ark turned West, Israel should go West.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have  you ever been unsure about which direction you should take? Or, have  you felt like God was calling you to do something daunting and scary?  Next time, take a cue from the Israelites - stay focused on God and  follow his presence.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write  down answers to the following questions: Do you have patterns in your  life that invite Gods presence? Are there behaviors or patterns cause  you to be distracted and "stray from the ark?" Ask God to show you his  presence and go where he says to go.</p>
