<p><strong>Friday, January 29</strong><br>Fear or Freedom? <br><br><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em><br><br><strong><br>READ </strong><br>Galatians 2:11-14<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Most of us can recall a time when we made a poor choice or missed an opportunity out of fear. Maybe it was fear of the unknown, fear of someones response, or even a physical fear. Whatever the case, fear almost always leads our hearts away from God.<br><br>The back-story on this Galatians passage is that Peter was a Jewish Christ-follower and leader of the church. Jewish law prohibited him from eating with non-Jews (Gentiles), but Jesus spoke against that law and gave both Jews and Gentiles the freedom to eat together. This freedom was critical for preventing division between Jews and Gentiles, both for the unity of the church and the spreading of Jesus message. Peter understood this, but because he was afraid of a certain group of fanatical Jews, he followed the old law. And this caused a hurtful division between Jewish and Gentile Christ-followers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about a time when you gave into a fear. What were the consequences?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong><br>Think of one fear that is affecting your life right now. Confess it to Jesus, and ask him to replace that fear with peaceand the belief that he will protect you and provide for you. <br><br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>2 Timothy 1:6-12</p>
