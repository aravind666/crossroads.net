<p>An Unexpected Answer</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to see and appreciate the unexpected ways youre moving in my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway Luke 2:1-20" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%202:1-20&amp;version=NIV">Luke 2:1-20</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We may not realize it, but the Israelite population had been waiting on the rescuer God had promised them for hundreds of years. Generations had come and gone, passing on the hope and expectation that God would come through and fulfill his promise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But not like this. Not a baby. They expected a warrior, a king, someone more like Chuck Norris. So imagine their disappointment, disbelief and shattered expectations when they heard the news of a very human child. Imagine the resistance. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Gods people had a front row seat for the prime moments of Gods plan, but many missed out it because he didnt come the way they expected.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there anything in your life right now that doesnt meet your expectations? Where do those expectations come from?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Among other things, the birth of Jesus tells us that if were unwilling to trust God in spite of what we see, we will miss his greatness at work. Spend a couple minutes being quiet, and ask God to reveal areas where he wants you to rely on him more than you rely on your own expectations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2011&amp;version=NIV">Acts 11</a></p>
