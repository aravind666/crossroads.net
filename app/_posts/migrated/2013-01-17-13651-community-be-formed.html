<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Be Formed</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We continue to look at what it means to be the church through understanding community. Well be looking at all of Romans chapter 12 this week, a few verses per day.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001mNeXJTccyXSwRFQSLrsVaUI8L_kz640uHt-zjudzIKrWt9EQ4lBz_MCdtWN535w-n8KMJTpWkibnppszbS1V94tidKK7h2ODKsxRX1G4lbcTprQqpdbr3x9LVF_AtI0lWwReg9PeNiIf2q-49KO7sX1otLECqQ_YjvpuZSbz00VQB0Q27YtIGGNkQYGppuHBLncVKShrKnTM91-6niZhrQ==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Romans 12:1-2</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Even though were talking about community this week, this chapter in Romans starts with the focus on self. Your life is being formed right now by one of two forces, the world or Christ. When we let the world form us, we are formed into individuals (which is lonely). When we are formed by Christ, we are like a puzzle piece or a thread in a tapestry--were part of a bigger picture.When we enter community through the lens of these two verses, we are set up to succeed.Offer your life up for God to form you into the image of Jesus, and let him give you a community to be woven into.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Picture yourself standing behind the cross. What parts of you (physically, mentally, or spiritually) might be outside of being conformed to that image? (This is one visual way to offer yourself as a living sacrifice)</p>
