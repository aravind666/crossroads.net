<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>When Jesus talked of being born a second time, he meant allowing Gods Spirit to direct our lives, all the way down to our everyday actions. Pharisees were religious leaders who had spectacular rule-following abilities, so this truly was a bold challenge for Nicodemus (and for all of us, if were being honest). Jesus was asking him to give up control and completely shift the foundation of his faith--to go from rule-following to Spirit-obeying.</p>
