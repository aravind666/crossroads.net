<p>Theres No Room For Negotiation</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, do not let my desire for comfort get in the way of doing your will.</em></p>

<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This  story of Abraham is perhaps the greatest story of obedience. Not just  because he was willing to sacrifice his only son, but because it was so  immediate. Abraham didnt</p>
<p>hesitate for a moment to do what God had asked of him. No whining, bargaining or questioning. Just pure obedience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God never wanted Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. God is not sadistic-he didnt wait 100</p>
<p>years  to give Abraham a son, only to take him away. Instead, God was testing  Abrahams heart: Did he love God more than anything, even his promised  and long-awaited son?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through his willingness to obey God so immediately and without question, Abraham not</p>
<p>only  proved his love, but he also strengthened his commitment to obey God,  and he learned about Gods provision. The result was astounding and  abundant blessings for Abraham and his generations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Has God ever asked you to do anything that was difficult or made you uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Maybe it was forgiving someone who hurt you, or sacrificing financially to help others.</p>
<p>Did you follow through? What happened?</p>
