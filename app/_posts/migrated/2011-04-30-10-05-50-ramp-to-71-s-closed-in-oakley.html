<p>Due to damage from the record rainfall, the ramp to 71 S from Ridge is closed for several weeks. If you&rsquo;re leaving Crossroads Oakley headed South,&nbsp;we suggest taking Madison Road, then a L on Red Bank Expressway, which has an entrance to 71 S. Alternatively, you can take the Norwood Lateral (562 W) to 75 S. Look for a map in this weekend&rsquo;s program.</p>
