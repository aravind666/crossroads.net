<p class="normal noPspace">Megala was only 12 years old when her step-father attempted to sell her  virginity. When <a title="IJM" href="http://www.ijm.org">International Justice Mission (IJM)</a>  social workers met her, she was sitting on the hotel bed, eating snacks, oblivious to the purpose for which she had been brought to the hotel. After they rescued her that night, after her rescue through IJM that night a social worker worked with her closely, providing support and explaining to her what was happening in terms she could understand.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Crossroads’ Mumbai aftercare partner, the St. Catherine’s Home, has been home to Megala for three years now.  Since coming to the home after her rescue, she has excelled in her at National Open School and even received two double promotions from Class III to Class V in the first year, then again from Class V to VII, where she is currently placed. Megala has also participated in vocational training programs including tailoring and jewelry making as well as basic computer skills. She enjoys participating in drum therapy and has built a trusting relationship with Abhilasha, her counselor, who is helping her grow towards holistic healing. The staff and other girls at the home speak highly of Megala praising her gentle spirit, and our social workers know her as a joyous child with an optimistic attitude. She loves to study, sketch, paint, and interact with her friends.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Now an empowered young woman through her resiliency and the rehabilitation services she has been given, Megala has plans to go back to the slums where she grew up and empower others. Megala wants to be a social worker or a drawing teacher when she grows up, and we are confident she will excel at whatever profession she chooses.</p>
