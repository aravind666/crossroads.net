Tonight, <strong>Tuesday, May 6 from 7-8&#58;30pm</strong>, is an opportunity to pray for those serving in the military and their families. If you or anyone in your family or volunteer team would like to receive prayer or pray for others, please come to the <strong>Prayer Room</strong> (adjacent to the Auditorium on the mezzanine level) tonight. Just look for the signs.<br /><br />If you can't make it but want to submit a prayer request, just <a href=\"../mysend/2\" title=\"Email Prayer Request\">email us</a>.<br />
