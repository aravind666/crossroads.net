<p>God is Present</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to consider Gods presence in your life. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2013:5&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 13:5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Scripture tells us that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. When we trust money as our provider or as our security, were not leaving room for God to take that role in our life.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you places where you are trusting things for your security rather than trusting him. Ask Him to show you where he is present and active in your life as your provider.</p>
<p></p>
