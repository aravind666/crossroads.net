Actually, they're not sketchy volunteers but characters in a video series called "The Kitchen" that K-4th grade students are watching. <br><br>Shrimpola (a fun-loving, relatively large, talking, blue shrimp) comes home from school to find that he has been gifted a personal chef/professional Mexican wrestler (Chef-O Libre). With the help of Music Mae, Rachel and many others, Shrimpola learns more about the life God wants for us. You can check out the video series (with or without your kids) here:<br><h3><a href="/" title="Crossroads Kids' Club Videos">crossroads.net/kidvideos</a></h3>Â </body></html>
