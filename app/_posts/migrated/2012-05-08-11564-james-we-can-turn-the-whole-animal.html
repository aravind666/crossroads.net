<p class="noPspace"><strong>James: We Can Turn The Whole Animal</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">As we continue to study the book of James, were focusing on the power of our tongues.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of ones life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Our tongues can do some damage, but they also have the potential for greatness. Think about the value of an encouraging word, a well-told story or truth spoken in love. The way we use our words can literally change the course of a life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you went to a service last weekend, you were challenged to encourage someone through a note, phone call or text. Today, try it again. (And face-to-face encouragement is a great option.)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2022&amp;version=TNIV">Acts 22</a></p>
