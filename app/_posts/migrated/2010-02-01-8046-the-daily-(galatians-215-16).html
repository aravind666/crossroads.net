<p><strong>Monday, February 1</strong><br>Breaking the Law</p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong><br>Galatians 2:15-16</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Its impossible for us to make ourselves right with God by following certain rules or trying to be a good, moral person. We cant earn Gods love by racking up a list of accomplishments.</p>
<p>If we rely on our own ability to impress God, we shut out his mercy and grace.</p>
<p>When God gave the Jews a strict code, known as the Mosaic Law, he was pointing out the reality of sin in our lives and our need for grace and redemption. Because try as we might (or might not), we cant obey the Law perfectly. Even the most disciplined person will make mistakes and screw up. Thankfully, God gives us another way: relationship with Jesus. Thats it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways are you tempted to try to earn Gods love? Is it through religious practices, over-committing to spiritual activities like serving or volunteering, or trying to live a moral life?</li>
</ul>
<p>These arent bad things to do, but if we are doing them to earn Gods approval, they actually become destructive to our relationship with him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Jesus died <em>for you</em>, to take the hit for your sin. You dont have to earn this sacrifice; it is a gift to be received. Right now, focus on that truth. When youre ready, thank Jesus for what hes done and release the notion that you have to pay him back somehow.</p>
