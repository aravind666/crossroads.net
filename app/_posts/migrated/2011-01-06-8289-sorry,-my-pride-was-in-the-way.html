<p>Sorry, My Pride Was in the Way</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me focus on your voice today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2018:12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 18:12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many of us have heard the warning: Pride goes before the fall, but in this proverb, Solomon draws the idea out to a deeper level. Hes explaining that our pride (arrogance) is incompatible with the honor God wants to give us. The two cant exist in the same heart. Either we act with an appropriate sense of self-worth (humility) and receive Gods reward of honor, or we become overly self-important and shut God and honor out of the equation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Grab a sheet of paper and go somewhere quiet. Take a few minutes and ask God to show you areas where pride exists in your life; as he shows them to you, write them down. Then ask him to help you learn to be humble in these areas.</p>
<p></p>
