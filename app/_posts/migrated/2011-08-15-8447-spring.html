<p>Spring</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, I choose to believe that you work through all seasons of my life. Teach me to live fully in each season of faith.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107110314549&amp;s=0&amp;e=0010DISFNoVrsOepAya4SGuDm6cS0vO9LjBvJmtt1KAkj51Lj7rUcL071oPVWh1HWvO1emZn4WopWOpKONo9Aqk3T4PjiVJXkf4PbKP92lHSVTmVpSbVVOr170rlus7S7ptmBDlB_kLwNeY8JfpvQpchJen-hYDspdKEv6UldWBbjQTxz1DA26dg1Vk-6wX6ksZJyp5ov4ShfGkbybeAjm2mSxuhLbuDnOmBVnfF0DH2IE=" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 3:1-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its  an old adage (and a groovy song), but there really is a time for  everything in our lives. A time for building, a time for moving, a time  for happiness, a time for pizza, a time for the Bengals to win (well,  maybe not everything), and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There  are things that God wants to grow in us, prune in us, and strengthen in  us. Yet he doesnt do these things all at once-they happen in various  seasons of our lives. Great Biblical figures throughout time have been  awakened in the spring of their faith, grew and worked in a spiritual  summer, understood harvest and beautiful death in the vibrant colors and  enriched soil of autumn, and waited, deepening in meditative winters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will look at these seasons of life- starting with spring. Spring is a time of new love.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take  a moment and look again at Ecclesiastes 3. Which statement did you  resist the most? Write down the phrase that stood out to you, and ask  God if it might be time for that in your life.</p>
<p></p>
