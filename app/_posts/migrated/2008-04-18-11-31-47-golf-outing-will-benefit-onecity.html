Brad Johansen, a familiar face both at Crossroads and in Cincinnati, will host his fourth annual Brad Johansen Celebrity Golf Classic on May 30. Last year, this event raised more than $270,000 for <a href=\"http&#58;//www.onecity.org\" title=\"OneCity web site\">OneCity,</a> one of Crossroads' key partners in fighting poverty in Cincinnati. It also benefited other local ministries including Cancer Free Kids, Matthew 25 Ministries and Neediest Kids of All.<br /><br />For more information, or to sign up to play, visit the Brad Johansen Celebrity Golf Classic <a href=\"http&#58;//www.bradjohansengolf.com\" title=\"BJCGC website\">website.</a> Even if you don't play golf, you can help by volunteering or donating a silent auction item. Just contact Erika via <a href=\"../../mysend/136\" title=\"Email for Erika at OneCity\">email</a> or at 513.579.0555.<br />
