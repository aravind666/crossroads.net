<img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/iam90x90.jpg\" alt=\"I AM\" hspace=\"5\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" align=\"right\" />We're in week four of   &quot;<a href=\"../my/media/messages.php\">I AM...</a>&quot;
In this series, we're examining the life of Jesus and seeing what it
looks like
to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we heard about Crossroads' plans for multi-site locations
and about the importance of reproducing and building into others.<br /><br />In case you missed the service, you can <a href=\"../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=584\">watch</a> (including the Melvin B. Tolson video) or <a href=\"../my/media/playMedia.php?idMedia=585\">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/StudyNotes4.27.08.pdf\">Study Notes</a> (PDF) and <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/0426_27Program.pdf\">Program</a> (PDF).
