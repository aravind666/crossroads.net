<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Battle: Get Light</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at the spiritual battle that surrounds us daily and how we can engage. Yesterday, we looked at getting low or being humble. Thats good battle prep. Today, look at getting light.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:6-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 5:6-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There is an enemyand he has plans for you. One of those plans is to distract you with worry. When we are distracted, we just cant be fully engaged in the life and purposes that God has planned for us, which is a life lived to the fullest. The best way to approach the spiritual battlefield that we enter on a daily basis is to start by casting all of our worries on God. We cant engage with both hands when one is holding on tightly to the concerns of the world.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Maybe you had some thoughts pop into your head while you were trying to read <em>The Daily</em> today. Did you think of work, a person, your family, your car, house/apartment, or a relationship? Picture yourself holding those things in your open hands--then lift them up to God and hoist them onto his shoulders.</p>
