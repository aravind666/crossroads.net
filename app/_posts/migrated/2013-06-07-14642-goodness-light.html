<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodness: Light</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to read through a passage in Ephesians 5 as we look at how God desires to walk with us in our sexuality.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:8-10&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5:8-10</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are not meant to have sex out on fountain square in the daylight, so how do we let God shine light into our sexuality? We invite Him. He isnt just outside on a bright day, he is the creator of light. Ask God to come into every area of your life (even into your bedroom) and shine his light. Gods light dissipates shame and breaks up sin blockages in our heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take time to picture yourself nude with a bright light shining on you. How do you feel? Where does it take your thoughts?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 1</a>.</p>
