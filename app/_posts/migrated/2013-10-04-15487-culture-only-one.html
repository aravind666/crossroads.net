<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>#Culture: Only One</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Mary has a singular focus and we want to be schooled by her today. #Whorocks #Maryrocks</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:38-42&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:38-42</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus commends Mary for having chosen the better way--in fact, not just the better way, the only way that matters. If you had to narrow the focus of your life down to one thing, would it be Jesus? Would you sit at his feet? Do you make time in your life right now to sit at Jesus feet?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take time to close your eyes and picture yourself sitting at Jesus feet. What would his feet look like? What would he say to you? How would you feel? What thoughts would go through your mind?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 17</a></p>
