<p>Awe</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to be near to you in this time.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:43&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:43</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Upon seeing the many signs and wonders delivered by the apostles, people were in awe. Were they only filled with awe because of these miracles? Maybe. Or could it be that their awe inspired the apostles to perform such miracles?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its the old chicken and the egg question: Which came first? Was it the wonders and signs that were done that led to the awe-filled Christ-followers? Or was it the awe-filled Christ-followers that helped the apostles do these things?</p>
<p></p>
<p>One thing is for certain, without an awe-filled heart, the early church probably would have missed the signs. Loving God with every bit of themselves let the new believers of the early church see how God was deeply involved in their lives and in the lives of those around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to fill your heart, and mind, with awe. Ask Him to help you to pay attention to, and to acknowledge him in the amazing thingsbig or smallaround you.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>What aspects of the life of the early church do you regularly experience today, and how does that impact your relationship with God?</li>
