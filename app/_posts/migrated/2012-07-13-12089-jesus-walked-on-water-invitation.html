<p class="noPspace"><strong>Jesus Walks on Water: Invitation</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Last week we saw Jesus multiply food, and this week well look at the miracle of Jesus walking on water. Today, notice how Jesus modeled receiving Gods invitation between the two miracles.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>What a schedule: teach and feed over 5,000 people, follow that up by healing a bunch of people in the next town, and on the way train the disciples by walking on water. Even in the midst of all this activity, Jesus heard and responded to his Fathers invitation. When his physical mission moved toward the lake, he went up the mountainside. This alone time isnt just a pause between two great feats--in a culture driven to "get it done," this could be the largest miracle we learn to imitate.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Do you read The Daily on the go? If so, take a moment right now to decide how tomorrow you could find time to head up the mountainside instead. Your Father is inviting you. Schedule it.</p>
