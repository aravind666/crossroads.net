Pastor Titus taught us on prayer and we had an incredible time of prayer after the service with our friends from South Africa.<br>In addition, <strong>over 600 people</strong> showed this morning for our 7am (yes...people DO, in fact, move that early...) prayer meeting. A great time was had by all.<br>(Oh...and the cicadas have emerged... but fortunately are relatively un-plague-like thus far.)<br>If you missed the weekend, you can catch the talk and study notes on the <a href="/media/series">messages</a> page. Enjoy!</body></html>
