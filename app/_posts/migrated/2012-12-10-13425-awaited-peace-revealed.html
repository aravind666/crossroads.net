<p class="noPspace"><strong>Awaited Peace: Revealed</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Mary and Joseph have taken their baby, Jesus, to the temple to be circumcised, as was tradition in the Jewish faith. The family has already received a prophecy from a man named Simeon. Now, Anna joins.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Anna heard what Simeon said to Mary. She knew that Jesus had come to reveal the deepest things in our hearts. She knew that Jesus was bringing a different kind of peace. Anna, who had clung to God all of her life, making God her husband when she was widowed, was ready to have her heart inspected before God. Thats peace. This peace, by the way, is so amazing for Anna that she spreads the good news.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
