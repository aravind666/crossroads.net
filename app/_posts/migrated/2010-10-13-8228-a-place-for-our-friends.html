<p>A Place for our Friends</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to consider the people in your life who are far from God.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%202:1-5&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 2:1-5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Who does a financial campaign in the midst of the Great Recession? People who are passionate about having a place where their friends can encounter Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Today, you read about what happens when friends bring friends to Jesus. Pray for the people in your life who are far from God. Pray for them to experience a genuine encounter with Jesus.</p>
