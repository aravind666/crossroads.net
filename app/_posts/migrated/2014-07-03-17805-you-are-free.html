<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were redefining the words happiness, wealth, family and love. All this week were receiving Gods love for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for his love.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="https://new.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 3:17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Gods love can free us from our troubles. His love frees girls in India. Its helping to free people in South Africa from HIV/AIDS. Its freeing people from homelessness in New Orleans. Gods love is freeing people right here in our city. When we receive His love and ask him for help, then we can experience the freedom only his love can bring.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend time with God and ask for his help in a spot in your life where you want freedom. Tell Him all about it and receive his love for you. Freedom may not come overnight, but trust that God is faithful.</p>
