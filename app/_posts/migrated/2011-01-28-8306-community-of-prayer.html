<p>Community of Prayer</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ:</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway James 5:13-20" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james%205:13-20&amp;version=NIV">James 5:13-20</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When you take a look at the early pictures of Christ-followers, a common refrain of conversation is their prayer for one another. They always seem to be lifting each other up in prayer before God, interceding for those who dont know him yet, and calling for healing and power in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever considered what itd look like to practice the same thing in your community of Christ-followers? If you dont currently pray together as a community, then start. Its as simple as that. There arent any special incantations you have to say, or rituals you must follow. Is someone hurting? Pray for them. Is someone struggling with fear or worry? Go to God on their behalf, and ask him to make his love perfect in them, and get that fear out of there.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Next time youre together with a group of friends and you hear someone hurting (or celebrating), ask them if you can pray for them. Thank God for your friendship with that person, and ask him to bless your friend. A community that prays together...(well, never mind, its corny).</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT<br></strong></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>This week weve taken a look at few traits of a healthy, functioning community--along with practical ways you can engage with your friends in this sort of community.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Has your understanding of community been challenged, and if so, how? If not, describe how healthy community (friendship) looks in your own life right now.</li>
<li>Reflect on the idea that sometimes a friend demonstrates their love for you by pointing out an area thats hard to see yourself. Does that feel like love to you? If not, what would love look like?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
