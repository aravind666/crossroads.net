<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New Courage: Take it!</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at overcoming fear and taking the courage God offers.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2015:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Chronicles 15:7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This passage is pulled from a chapter in Chronicles where the King has gotten his people way off track. After this verse, the nation is totally changed. Taking courage is the crux of change. God is fearless--he is courage and a courage giver. He is waiting to replace your fear with courage and strength. God has courage just hovering over you. Your job is to take it!</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Confess your fears to God today, and then make an active movement to reach out and take courage and plant it in your chest. Continuing to trust God will water that seed of courage.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 2</a></p>
