At Crossroads Mason, you'll see the same message as Crossroads Oakley, thanks to state-of-the-art video projection. There will be live music, live Kids' Club and CSM and, most importantly, free coffee. <strong>Crossroads Mason service times are 9:00 and 10:30am </strong>(Kids' Club at both services; CSM at 10:30 only) and is located in Mason Middle School. <a href="about/serviceTimes.php" title="Service times and directions page">Get directions</a> to Crossroads Mason.
