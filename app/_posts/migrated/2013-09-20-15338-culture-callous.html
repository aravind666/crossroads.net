<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Culture: Callous</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at a passage in Ephesians 4 today, adding one verse at a time. These two verses together convey the culture of this world if we have turned a blind eye to Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:18-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4:18-19</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Maybe you immediately connected with this passage, and said, Yes, thats me. Maybe you felt like, Ah nah, thats not me at all. Wipe both of those from your mind and remember that we are all fallen, or sinners. And yes, simultaneously, we are all made new or redeemable through Christ. The word callous means an area where you have rubbed up against something for so long that youve gotten used to it. Today, set your own self-assessment aside and let God do that role with clear eyes.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Let your mind and heart go quiet, and then ask God if there is anything in your life that he wants to show you with his clear eyes.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Luke 5</a></p>
