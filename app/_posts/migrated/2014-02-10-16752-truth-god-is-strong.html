<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Truth: God is Strong</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week well assume only that the Bible is a big book about God and hes the main character. Well look at verses and mull over what it means for us if what they say is true.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to exchange your weakness for his strength.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A28-31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">ISAIAH 40:28-31</a></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength. Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>THE TRUTH</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Gods strength created the world and the universe. If He were anything like us, God might keep that strength all to himself. But if what Isaiah says is true, it means our Father shares his strength with us. When we put our hope in God and invite him in to our lives, whether we are young or old, weightlifters or couch potatoes, we will not be tired. Well have the energy and strength to do the work and be the people He created us to be.</p>
