<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Give Grace</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What really makes Jesus unique when we line up all religions? His grace. This week, weve looked at the grace of Jesus and wrestled with what it means for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to to show you someone who needs grace.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12%3A9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 8:7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The grace we receive through Jesus is enough for everyday no matter what life throws at us. Its not a one-time transaction. His grace goes on and on and we dont have to do anything to receive it. But God doesnt want us to keep it to ourselves. If we want to reflect who Jesus is, we need to freely give his grace away.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Give grace to another person today. Maybe someone came right to mind or maybe not. Either way, be on the lookout for someone to actively share Gods grace (that means love).</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4</a></p>
