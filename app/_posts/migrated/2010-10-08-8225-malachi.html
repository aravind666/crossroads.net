<p>Malachi</p>
<p><em><br>Prayer: God, teach me how I can trust you more.</em></p>
<p><br><br><strong>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Malachi%203:8-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Malachi 3:8-12</a></p>
<p><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong> <br>This is one of the only times in the Bible where God says to test him. And He says to test him on tithing.</p>
<p>When we give ten percent back to God, were thanking him for the gifts hes already given usincluding the ability to have a job and bring home income. When we tithe, its an act of faith reminding us that were connected to all of his resources. And Hes a big God. Were also trusting Him to allocate those resources to where they need to go.</p>
<p>God loves when we trust him, because trust is what relationships are founded upon.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong> <br>Ask God to show you where you trust him and where you can grow in trusting him.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2026:4-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 26:4-7</a></p>

<p><br>Old Testament prophetic books have themes around repentance, justice and mercy. God wants us to surrender our lives to his much bigger plan for the world. And justice and mercy are the way He operates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about promptings you had this week that could involve you more in Gods mission.</li>
<li>Take time in community to share anything that you realized this week could be separating or distracting you from Gods bigger plan.</li>
<li>Many of the Another Look verses are prophesies about the coming of Jesus. Did any of the prophesies surprise you this week? Whats one way that Jesus fulfills Gods plans for justice and mercy?</li>
</ul>
