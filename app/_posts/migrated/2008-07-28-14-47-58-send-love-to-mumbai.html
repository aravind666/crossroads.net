<html><body><p>Send love to girls who have been rescued from forced prostitution in Mumbai through a care package just for them. When girls are rescued, they often have nothing with them. You can help provide them with basics like lotion, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste and demonstrate that people do care about them. For more information on what goes in the care package, click <a href="/" target="_blank" title="Care Package Flyer">here</a> to read the flyer. Care package collection takes place the weekends of August 2 and 3 and August 9 and 10. </p></body></html>
