<p>A Peaceful Conquest</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me experience your deep, peaceful love today.</em> </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway zechariah 9:9-10" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zechariah%209:9-10&amp;version=NIV">Zechariah 9:9-10</a>; <a title="Bible Gateway Matthew 21:1-11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:1-11&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 21:1-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We talked about it last week, but for hundreds of years the people of Israel had been waiting for Gods promised rescuersomeone of the warrior sort who would bring them to a new place of freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, as Jesus rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, it had begun, right? Only one problem: He came riding on a donkey, not a horse. It may not seem like much, but its a huge statement. A horse is what you ride when you go to war. A donkey is what you ride when you are at peace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus conquest would not come through swords and violence. It would be the long, slow conquest of peaceful love.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Among other things, this story highlights that we can be celebrating the presence of Jesus, and yet still misunderstand his mission. Take a few minutes and brainstorm (be sure to ask Him in on that session) some ways that you can connect with the mission of God right now in your daily life.</p>
