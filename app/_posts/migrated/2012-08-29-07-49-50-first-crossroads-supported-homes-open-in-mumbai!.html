<p class=\"noPspace\">Things can move slowly in India. Efforts can be halted or derailed at the last moment, even when you&rsquo;ve spent months laying the groundwork to make something happen. Big victories can be tough to come by, but we&rsquo;re happy to share one with you today&#58; two new homes are now open in Mumbai, thanks to funding from Crossroads and a year of hard work by Crossover Foundation and local Indian church partner, Maharashtra Baptist Society (MBS). This means 12 young women rehabilitating from forced prostitution have moved to a more independent, nurturing environment in which they can continue to heal, learn and receive restoration.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Crossroads Director of India Projects, Don Gerred, says the two Mumbai homes are a hybrid of transition and independent group homes for young women over 18. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a smaller scale setting with multiple apartments and house mothers, but they require less intensive intervention at a lower cost,&rdquo; Gerred says. &ldquo;Originally, our priority was opening transition homes, but due to some delays in acquiring licenses, we shifted our focus to opening these group aftercare homes.&rdquo; The two homes are located in the same neighborhood to centralize services, and three more homes are planned in the same area in the coming months by MBS and our other church partners. Crossover Foundation&rsquo;s Co-founder Ramona Dsouza reports that the women are so happy to be in their new homes. Folks in this community who have supported the <a href=\"/gamechange/#initiatives\">Game Change</a> initiative made this possible. God is good!</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The Indian church is getting involved, connections are being made, and lives are being changed. The existing aftercare homes Crossover works with in Mumbai are impacting around 520 sex-trafficking survivors. It&rsquo;s hard not to want more things like that to happen instantly, but what&rsquo;s going on in Mumbai is great evidence of change taking place on God&rsquo;s timing.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Keep praying for the women who have been rescued, those who have yet to be rescued, and for all of the people working in the homes and behind the scenes to bring them to wholeness.&nbsp;</p>
