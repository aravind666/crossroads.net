<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Ready, Set, Ask</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week were spending time with God and with people we trust to find out how we can change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for direction in an area of your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A1-5&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:1-5</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+33%3A3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Jeremiah 33:3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We dont have to know what were going to change or how were going to change it. We just need to be ready and willing to start. Then, through spending time with God---because he knows every little detail about us---he will tell us what to change and guide us through it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What is God asking you to change? It doesnt have to be earth-shattering. Maybe He wants you to switch to decaf or turn the TV off during dinner. Trust that whatever He puts on your heart youre ready to make happen.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 3</a></p>
