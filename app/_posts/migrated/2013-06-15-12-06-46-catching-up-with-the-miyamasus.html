<p class="noPspace">After nine months in Mumbai working on a Game Change aftercare project, Dave and Cheryl Miyamasu made their way back to Cincinnati for a bit of R&amp;R. During their month-long furlough in the States, Crossroads staffer Jamie Elkins sat down with them for a chat.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">(To learn more about why the Miyamasus went to Mumbai, read our <a href="/blog/view/5/12083">July 2012 blog post</a>.)</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><em>Your recent visit to the States happened to coincide with a major initiative around here called GO Cincinnati. What was it like to be back home and serving in your U.S. community?</em></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">CHERYL: Awesome. We love GO Cincinnati. We led a project a few years ago and had a great experience, so we were glad to be able to serve again. Both of us were pumped up at the rally beforehand. It felt like a glimpse of heaven on earth&mdash;a place where we&rsquo;re all united for one cause and serving the Lord together. It was also fun to work on a project with the small group we were part of before we went to India. Overall, it was great to be back and serving the city we love together.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>In April, 23 people from Crossroads were in India for a GO trip, during which they conducted a marriage enrichment conference for Indian pastors and their wives. As people who have been serving on the ground in Mumbai, what did you observe? Did the conference impact the GO trip participants, as well as the pastors? &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">CHERYL: Since we arrived in India, pastors have been consistently asking to experience a marriage conference firsthand. There was a unique openness and they were extremely excited to go through this experience. In a culture where women don&rsquo;t speak up as much, it was great to see the pastors listening to their wives and allowing them to speak up. They were humbled to receive new insights on how to improve their relationships. These pastors taking the time to invest in their marriages will ultimately impact their children and communities they serve.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We were at a table facilitating with some of our Crossroads GO trip participants. Again and again, they said they felt so blessed to have gone through the experience and were looking forward to applying the material to their own lives. They also said they felt blessed to be staying at the beautiful hotel&mdash;so many of them had never been to such a nice place.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">DAVE: I got to witness the new culture opening the eyes of GO trip participants to a different way of thinking, a different way of living. The trip gave them time to take in the experience, enjoy the worship, and really soak in the rest. For a lot of them, this was the first vacation they had taken in years. They were also given the chance to take steps forward in faith and experience God in new ways&mdash;praying, repenting and letting go of sin, being baptized, and receiving the Holy Spirit. It was really cool that they came over and served in order to bless the Indian pastors, the staff and the girls, but we&rsquo;re also excited that they had the chance to reflect and receive blessing themselves.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>What has being back in Cincinnati been like for you after being away in India for nine months?</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">DAVE<em>:</em> Cheryl and I have found that Cincinnati is actually a great place to rest. Truthfully, Mumbai is a place where we&rsquo;ve felt on guard and under constant stress&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a way of life in that city. So we&rsquo;ve really enjoyed the opportunity to recuperate where it&rsquo;s green and cool, and we can take in some fresh air.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">CHERYL<em>:</em> When people ask us what we miss most, it&rsquo;s always the people. That&rsquo;s what we were looking forward to the most&mdash;reconnecting with family, friends and our Crossroads community. We&rsquo;ve been so encouraged and touched hearing about all the people who have been praying for us&mdash;people who don&rsquo;t even know us. It&rsquo;s been humbling but also a huge blessing.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>What will the next few months bring for you in Mumbai? And how can your Crossroads community pray specifically for the two of you?</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">CHERYL<em>:</em> The next few months in Mumbai will continue to bring us adventures and opportunities to trust God in all areas of our life. We are excited to be part of the work He is doing in Mumbai with the girls. We will continue our work helping the girls in their process of healing and restoration. The Crossroads community has been so supportive in praying for us, and we are grateful. You can pray specifically for:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects that we are working on to support the aftercare process</li>
<li>Protection over us physically, emotionally and spiritually</li>
<li>Strength, wisdom, discernment and protection in our work and marriage</li>
</ul>
