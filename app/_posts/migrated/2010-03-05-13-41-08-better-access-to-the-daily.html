<p>The Daily is an electronic tool that enables you to engage with the Bible and prayer regularly (in just about 15 minutes each weekday). It follows a simple format of reading, reflection and response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those of you who had subscribed to receive The Daily in your My Crossroads blog might notice that it no longer appears there. To make it a little easier to view all the editions of The Daily in one place, we've added a link in the left menu of this homepage. (Look, it's just to the left, second from the top!) If you like to read The Daily online, you can stay logged into crossroads.net and bookmark <a title="The Daily" href="/my/daily.php">this page</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're already receiving The Daily via email, it won't be interrupted. If you'd like to receive it in your inbox each day, you can <a title="Subscribe to The Daily via Email" href="/my/grow/theDailySignup.php">subscribe to receive The Daily via email here</a>.</p>
