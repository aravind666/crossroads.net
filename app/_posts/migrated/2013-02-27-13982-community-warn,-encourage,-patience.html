<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Warn, Encourage, Patience</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today is our last day of looking at the role of other people in our daily walk with God and the process of listening and acting on what you hear.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:12-15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">I Thessalonians 5:12-15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">There are three important keys here to a healthy community. Encouragement is a good step toward moving a group of people toward God. But if we leave out admonishing or warning, or are unwilling to receive corrective feedback, we are only getting half of the benefit of community. Ah, but the ticket to how is the word patience. Together, encouragement, warning, and patience is an effective full picture of a healthy community.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Journal today about whether you are better at encouraging or challenging the people in your life. Second, write about how you are with receiving encouragement or admonishment.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">If you are meeting to discuss this weeks topic, way to go, you are actively pursuing community! Take a moment to celebrate that by encouraging each other.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Share one place in your life where you are sensing God, and how you think you might act on it.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Be each others counsel. Based on what each person sensed they are hearing from God, give encouragement and challenge about moving on what your each hearing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%207&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 7</a></p>
