<p>Intentional Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Hebrews 10:24-25" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2010:24-25&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 10:24-25</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Ever met someone who seems to know a million people? Maybe thats you. The life of the party. Or maybe you find yourself grasping for friendship with someoneto be understood and to understand someone else. Its the rare person who doesnt crave to be known by another. Its how were wired. But to simply know someones name verses to be in community with that person can be two different things.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the writer of Hebrews encouraged us to consider how we may spur one another along, it wasnt a slip of the tongue. Intentional, rich community isnt an accident, nor does it just naturally happeneven if people like each other. Any community that exists involves some level of intentionality. You dont get known by the bartender at your local watering hole without going there night after night. And you dont get to know another persons deepest fears and greatest joys without intentionally sharing your own. Intentional community happens when youre intentional. It starts when you recognize the need for it, and then take small, consistent steps towards making it happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Dont know how to begin an intentional friendship with someone? Start with asking about their story. Then listen. Ask questions as theyre sharing, and stay attentive. Start with someone you know who is following Jesus in a way youd like to. Youll accomplish at least two things: youll have been intentional in getting to know a friend more deeply, and youll begin to remove any notion that they have it all together (because none of us have it all together, and the more intentional you are in your friendships, the more youll discover that).</p>
