<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Job is known throughout the world (not just within the Christian faith) as a story of suffering. Yet, Job who went through the toughest of times knew how much he was dependant on Gods words. Today, we have access to God and his communications to us his people through the Bible, which was canonized and mass printed long after Job. Much like Job we can listen for God to communicate with us daily, and in reading the Bible, we can see his voice daily as well.</p>
