<p>Truthful Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Matthew 18:15-17" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2018:15-17&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 18:15-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>While intentionality and encouragement are critical when entering into real community, so is the ability to speak and receive words of truth with grace. Honing your ability to both deliver and receive truth well is critical for a healthy community, because there will be times when people disappoint you, anger you, or just plain annoy you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regardless of how the message is delivered, its important within a trusted community to remember that the information is being given to help and strengthen the person receiving it. Practice giving the benefit of the doubt to the person delivering the message, and if you get some hard truth from people in your trusted community, practice grace. Its not easy on either side, but its worth it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ultimately, its a tremendous act of love to have an uncomfortable conversation with someone you care about, but in doing so youre effectively saying, I love you enough to not let you continue to hurt yourself (or others) this way. Its not love in the ooey gooey sense, but its love nonetheless, and critical for each of us to receive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend a moment considering a time when someone has told you something that was hard to hear. Regardless of delivery, did you receive the information as helpful? How could a healthy, functioning community practice this discipline well?</p>
