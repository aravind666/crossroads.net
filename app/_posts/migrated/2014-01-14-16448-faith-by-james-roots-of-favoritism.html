<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Open your heart toward whatever God wants to teach you, today. It may not always be what you want to hear, so ask Him to prepare you.</p>


<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+2%3A8-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:8-13</a></p>


<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whats at the root of our favoritism? When we favor a group of people, what are we desiring or feel we lack? James attacks favoritism like a banshee. He knows that when were playing favorites or using others to confirm our importance, our intelligence, our coolness---whatever it may be---then were not fully believing that our value comes from God. And if were trying to be more like Jesus in the way we live, playing favorites sure doesnt represent Jesus to the world around us. Mercy over judgement, James says.</p>


<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you go about your day, take note of the people who are favored and not so favored. Ask God to show you at least one simple way you can brush aside the popularity contest and love your neighbor as yourself.</p>


<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>


<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8</a></p>
