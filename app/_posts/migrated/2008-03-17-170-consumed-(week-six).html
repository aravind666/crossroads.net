our 2008 "all church journey" is now in week six. This past weekend, Brian Tome spoke to us about how generous communities change the world. We were each challenged to live more generous lives and the "mark the moment" by tacking our commitment to the big screen. It was a very cool and significant moment for our community.<br><br>As always, if you missed the service you can <a href="/messages/2008-03-16-community.html">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="/messages/2008-03-16-community.html">watch it</a><a href="/messages/2008-03-16-community.html">.</a><a href="/messages/2008-03-09-prayer.html"> </a>
