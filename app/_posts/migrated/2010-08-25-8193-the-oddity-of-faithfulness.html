<p>The Oddity of Faithfulness</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness in your life.</em><br><br></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its not the most common military strategy for conquering a city, is it? March around a city in a circle, blow some horns, yell, then wait for the walls to fall down. Its safe to say that this story hasnt made it into the textbooks at West Point.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet such oddity is exactly what faithfulnesstrusting in the promises of Godcalls for at times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To be faithful is to stand out, to go against the norm. Its against the norm to be kind to enemies. Our society has no place for sacrificial love or radical generosity. But faithfulness will lead us straight to such oddities.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you have felt if you were one of the people marching around Jericho? (For more context, read the whole story below.)</li>
<li>What odd things has following God caused you to do in the past?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>One of the interesting things about the Jericho story is that God didnt have to knock down the walls this way. (He is God, after all.) Yet He chooses this method to give people an opportunity to trust him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same is often true in our own lives. God can accomplish his goals in a variety of ways, but often does so in ways that give us an opportunity to trust him. Take a few minutes to ask God where in your life hes giving you the opportunity to do something odd.</p>
