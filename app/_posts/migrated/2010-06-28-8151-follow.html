<p><strong>Week 1: Peter - A Trust Study</strong></p>

<p><em>Take a moment and pray: God, I invite you to teach me about your character through how you trust me and through the life of Simon Peter as he trusted you.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%201:16-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 1:16-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Hebrew boys who showed promise in early education were eligible to go on to become rabbis (esteemed Jewish teachers). These boys were hand-selected, and the honor was great. Simon Peter, however, wasnt chosen for this role. He stayed in his familys fishing business. Until Jesus chose him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter could haveand culturally, maybe should haveasked his family if he could follow Jesus (especially because Jesus was a controversial teacher). Instead, he drops his nets. Theres no lengthy discussion of salary or debate of theological views. No, Let me get back to you after I check with my parents or after I consider how following you might impact my image. He doesnt even ask about the dorm life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter just seems to know Gods voice. He trusts. He drops his net: his family net, his safety net, his net income. Then he simply follows.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Picture yourself with your net in hand, coming face-to-face with Jesus. What would your net be? Would you let it go to follow?</p>
