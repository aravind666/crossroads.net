<p>Unforgiving Servant</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2018:21-35&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 18:21-35</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When we owe something, we really want forgiveness. We want to be set free.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet when someone owes us, letting go is much more challenging. We want whats rightfully ours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All of us would gladly be forgiven of millions worth of debt, yet it can be all too easy to hold a grudge over 20 bucks owed to us. But here, Jesus gives us a glimpse of Gods perspective when it comes to forgiveness. All of us (if we choose to accept it) are forgiven of a debt we couldnt pay in 10 lifetimes. Refusing forgiveness to others simply cant be an option for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think it is so difficult for us to forgive others? </li>
<li>How does Jesus statement in verse 35 make you feel? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of where we stand in forgiving others, God has forgiven us all of a massive debt. Grab your journal (or a piece of paper), and take a couple of minutes to write a specific thank you letter to God for the forgiveness Hes given you.</p>
