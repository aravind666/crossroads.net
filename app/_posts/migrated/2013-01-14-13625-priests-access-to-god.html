<p class="noPspace"><strong>Priests: Access to God</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Were continuing with the topic of priests in the church. Today, we will see how Jesus became the perfect priest to make a way for all of us to access God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Inside the temple (where Gods people gathered long before Jesus) was an area where only priests could go, called the Most Holy Place. Priests would purify themselves and make offerings for their own sin before entering. Then, they would enter and make offerings for the people, talk to God and sometimes hear him respond.Only priestscould go in the Most Holy Place. At the moment Jesus died, this amazing thing happened. The curtain that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the temple, was torn in two. No longer would people have to interact with God through a priest. God, through Jesus (the perfect priest), would now be accessible to all.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Do you think of prayer as a natural right or as a blessing that Jesus did the work to provide for? Write a thank you note to Jesus for the gift of talking to your Father.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
