<html><body><p>Instead of the Awaited performance originally scheduled for this
evening, we will have a time of prayer, reflection and worship at 7pm at Crossroads Oakley. For those who are interested, counselors will be available to meet with families and children to help talk through and process last evening's events.</p></body></html>
