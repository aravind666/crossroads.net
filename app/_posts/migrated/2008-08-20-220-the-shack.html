When many friends and people in my close community approached me about the William P. Young book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shack-William-P-Young/dp/0964729237/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219258682&amp;sr=8-2">The Shack</a>, I had a similar reaction. And then I noticed that many of the people who were asking me about the book were not the typical "have you heard about the latest-coolest-hippest-relavantized-thingy" kind of people but people whose relationship with Jesus I admired and trusted. I decided to give it a try. I found it to be an intriguing read and well worth the time.<br><br>There's a discussion going in the forum about the book, and I'm curious if anyone else has read it and whether or not you have any opinions.<br><br><strong>FORUM: </strong><a href="/forum/viewtopic.php?t=438">The Shack</a>
