<p class="noPspace"><strong>Move: Connect</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to look at the story of Paul in Athens. Paul has began conversations, been mocked, and then been invited to speak in front of the influential thinkers (the Areopagus).</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When a door opens for Paul to be with the thought-fashioners of Athens, he quickly moves into making connections. Paul doesnt lead with theological whammies, likeJesus died for your sins.Instead, Paul starts by connecting with the Athenians through their own art and poetry, to show them that they already know this truth.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think about the people in your life with whom you would like to talk about God. Maybe you made a list yesterday. Think about some ways that you could bridge the conversation. Take a moment and ask God to help you spot the bridges.</p>
