<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Song</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God loves the word new. It seems to repeat in the Bible, and this week we are looking at that theme. Today, we look at singing a new song.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2096:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 96:1</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So, why a new song? I like singing that same old hymn, whats wrong with that? There is a place for tradition in the church, but actually, it doesnt say anywhere in the Bible to create a canon of good songs (and call it a hymnal) and then sing them over and over again. It does say in multiple places in the Bible to sing a new song. New songs require something of us--creativity, courage, faith, trusting God and honesty.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write a poem to God today (or a song if you are so inclined). Keep it simple. Be okay with less than perfect.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2016&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 16</a></p>
