<p><strong>Friday, February 5</strong><br>Undivided</p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%203:26-28&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><br>Galatians 3:26-28</a><br>(Click to view the scripture online.)<em><br><br></em></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Sometimes its easier to receive grace than give it.</p>
<p>When you enter into a relationship with Jesus, you immediately become one with the entire family of Christ-followers: past, present, future. You dont handpick this family by deciding whos the most fun to hang around or who makes your life the easiest. Whoever chooses to follow Jesus is part of his family, and every one of us is fully loved and fully redeemed. So even though its often our tendency to judge and rank others, God sees no distinctions or divisions between us. We all need the same measure of grace.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the idea of being welcomed into a new family strike you? What hopes or hesitation does this cause you to feel?</li>
<li>How has this new family (i.e. the Church) been one of the ways youve experienced Gods love and freedom?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Gods family, the Church, is designed to be a support system for Christ-followers and a force of Gods love and freedom in the world. Just like any family unit, in order to be healthy, vibrant and effective, its members must be committed and engaged. Think of one need in your life right now, whether its physical, emotional or spiritual. Ask God to meet that need through your Church family, and ask him to meet someone elses need through you.</p>

<p><strong><br> Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</p>
<p>Weve been focusing this week on the difference between law and grace, and what it means to stop trying to earn Gods favor and accept his love.</p>
<ul>
<li>When were tied to the law, we often pull away from other people because we think we can do things best. Is there an area of your life where you need to let go by trusting and submitting to another person?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you have a hard time accepting Gods grace, whats something that holds you back? If you have a hard time <em>giving </em>grace, whats something that holds you back?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Consider a person who needs to see Gods grace reflected in you. What could it look like to act on that?</li>
</ul>
