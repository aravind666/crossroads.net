<p>Our 2010 Habitat for Humanity project kicks off on July 10 in College  Hill with Habitat&rsquo;s first green build in the area. In addition to site volunteers, we&rsquo;re still seeking help with  updating the blog, making lunch for volunteers, registering volunteers  and capturing the process in photo/video. Read more about the build <a title=\"Cincinnati.com article\" href=\"http&#58;//local.cincinnati.com/share/news/story.aspx?sid=168216&amp;cid=100226\">here</a>, or <a title=\"Habitat email\" href=\"http&#58;//www.crossroads.net/mysend/35\">email</a> to get involved.
