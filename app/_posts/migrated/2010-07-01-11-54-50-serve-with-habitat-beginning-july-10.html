<html><body><p>Our 2010 Habitat for Humanity project kicks off on July 10 in College  Hill with Habitat’s first green build in the area. In addition to site volunteers, we’re still seeking help with  updating the blog, making lunch for volunteers, registering volunteers  and capturing the process in photo/video. Read more about the build <a title="Cincinnati.com article" href="">here</a>, or <a title="Habitat email" href="">email</a> to get involved. You can also follow along on the project by bookmarking <a href="">crossroads.net/habitatblog.</a></p></body></html>
