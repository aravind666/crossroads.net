<p><strong>Week 2: The Good God of the Old Testament</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, April 4</strong></p>
<p>God Isnt Trigger Happy</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you read todays scripture, take a minute to ask God to show you who he truly is.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2018:20-32&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 18:20-32</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The Old Testament is chock-full of stories that paint God as a loving and compassionate father, not the Dirty Harry image that sometimes comes to mind. And while God doesnt deny the existence of consequence, he personifies mercy more than malice, grace more than getting even.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you read that story about Abrahams bargaining with God, what came to mind? Was it surprising to see God acquiesce and give in to Abrahams request? Did you expect Him to draw a line in the sand and ignore Abraham? And if you were surprised, what does this say about your relationship with God today? Hebrews 13:8 says that God is the same yesterday, today and forever. His character doesnt change somewhere in those pages between Malachi and Matthew. The most basic (and, likely, the most complex) characteristic of God is that he is simply love.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take some time to flesh out what you think God is like. No matter how bad it sounds, be willing to accept that its your view of Him now. It may change someday, but let God in on how you see him at this moment and ask him to show you where to go with that.</p>
<p></p>
