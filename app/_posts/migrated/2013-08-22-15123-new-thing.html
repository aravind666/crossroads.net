<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Thing</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The past two days weve looked at offering God our newest and best, and singing a new song. Today, we look at how God continues to create new things.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 43:19</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">From the time you were born until now, you have formed a grid of understanding that helps you to know how the world works. Youve come to believe that people will or wont behave a certain way in a situation, and that gravity and other laws of science always function the same. You have also formed some beliefs about God and what he will and wont do. Hit the reset button today on how you see God. He might want you to think of him in some new ways.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to tell you some words that describe him and write them down in your journal. Its okay if they surprise you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 1</a></p>
