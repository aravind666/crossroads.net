<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out our week of The Dailys look at daily rhythms.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203:13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 3:13</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The teachings of the Bible on practices that should recur daily seem to create a flow of relationship between us and God through listening and enjoying him. Then a transition yesterday and today that our relationship with God should cause our daily interactions and relationships with others to look different. Yesterday we looked at laying down our life to serve, today we see a key way to serve is through encouragement. Do you ever have a good thought about someone, but you just dont tell them? Lets experiment Today as this verse says with emphasis in not holding on to those positive thoughts, but giving them away.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Decide right now to say out loud or in a note every encouraging thought that you have. And focus on seeing the best in others.</p>
