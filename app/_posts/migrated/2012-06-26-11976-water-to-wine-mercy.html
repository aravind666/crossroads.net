<p class="noPspace">No one likes getting bad news, but especially bad news that is your fault. Read the story as the bridegroom and notice what he may have experienced.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Wouldnt it be fantastic if every time we failed, the mistake was corrected before it ever got to us? Thats the good life. A good definition for grace is receiving anything that we dont necessarily deserve. Mercy is not receiving what we do deserve. The bridegroom in the story deserved to receive frustration from the banquet master, and offense from the guests. Instead, the bridegroom was praised for saving the best wine until the very end.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Can you look back and remember a time when you didnt get what you know you deserved? A time when you received mercy, even if you havent thought of it that way before. Take a moment and thank God for his mercy.</p>
