<p>Its Not About Us</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me see your heart for work in my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:%2022-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 3: 22-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why so many of us are workaholics? It seems that once we made work all about us, we became less and less satisfied. Today, many of us operate from that mindset and have decided that if we arent helicopter parents, or dont have the luxury SUV in the driveway, we arent doing enough. Instead of working for a living, our discontent enslaves us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But in his letter to the Colossians, Paul says that if we are working for God, everything is changed. Working for God means we can work in the worst conditionsbut still work hardbecause its a way to honor God. Our work isnt to satisfy our boss, its to satisfy God himself. Its an act of worship. Reclaim work by understanding that its not important who knows what work you did today. God knows every single ounce of work you did, and he is pleased.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Make a list of your daily work. Include both tasks and relational responsibilities. Rank them in order of importance. Now consider how God would rank them. Any similarities or differences? Does this change how you approach your daily work?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 1</a></p>
