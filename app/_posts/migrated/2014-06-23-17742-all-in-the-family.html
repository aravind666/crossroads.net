<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>All in the Family</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were redefining the words happiness, wealth, family and love. This week, well rediscover how big, small, and present our families can be.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for your family.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3%3A31-35&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 3:31-35</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A19&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 2:19</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Somewhere in a leather-bound photo album in moms house is at least one awkward family photo. Matching outfits, a sky-blue background, someone with a frown on their face---this is a typical image of a family. But Jesus says something different about what makes a family. Its more than someone who shares our DNA. Family is made up of people we share our lives with in the good times and the bad.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Who is your family? Make a list of all the people who you love, trust and those who challenge you. Post that list somewhere and make room this week to spend time together with them.</p>
