<p><em>God, thank you for revealing your character through the created world.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Amazing how much of life can be captured with a song.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For many of us, songs capture elements of life far more than anything else. In moments of great joy, they are an anthemand in our sorrow, they are a solace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is not just true for us; it was true for followers of God in ancient times as well. The book of Psalms is the songbook for Gods people. And these songs are a snapshot of what life spent in relationship with God looks likefor both good and bad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So as we spend a couple weeks looking at these songs written by others, theres a good chance we will see ourselves in them as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes and think back to a moment when God taught you something in a song, even if it wasnt an outwardly Christian song. Thank Him for giving you those moments, and ask him to help you learn from the songs of others in the next two weeks.</p>
