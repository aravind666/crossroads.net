<p class="normal noPspace">In 1995, a group of 11  Cincinnatians felt a need. They wanted a place in Hyde Park to meet with  friends and explore questions about God without pretending they had it  all together or wading through a bunch of religious lingo. They invited  their friends. Their friends showed up. And theyre still showing up  today.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">As a community weve been given a unique role in the Kingdom of  God. We speak a dialect that people whove given up on church but  havent necessarily given up on God understand and respond to. And while  our goal has always remained the same: to connect people seeking God  with a community of growing Christ-followers (who are changing the  world), our vision has expanded beyond Hyde Park and Mt Lookout.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Over the last 14  years, God has used Crossroads to bring thousands of people into a  relationship with Jesus. And we dont think hes finished using us. The  last census said there were approx. 330,000 folks whod call themselves  Cincinnatians. As you can imagine, they wont all fit at 3500 Madison  Rd. At the same time, the Lord is calling this community to go after some  big things, things that are close to His heart, but will require a  larger base of folks to accomplish. To passionately pursue everyday  Cincinnatians we need spaces around the city, in their neighborhoods,  that allow friends to invite friends into a place that welcomes their  questions and speaks their language.</p>
