<html><body><p>Nothing happens at Crossroads without the generosity of everyday people in our community. We're extremely diversified financially (there are no phantom fat cats around here), and that means everyone's contribution is vitally important.<br><br><strong>Your decision right now makes a huge difference.</strong> <a href="/my/give/giveToCrossroads.php" title="Give to Crossroads">Click here</a> to make a secure, one-time gift, or set up a regular amount or percentage of your income to give electronically via E-gift. You can also mail year-end contributions to Crossroads' office (3500 Madison Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45209), or drop them in the secure slot next to the Office Entrance (just west of the West Entrance) at Crossroads Oakley.<br><br>God is doing amazing things in our midst, and it's great to be able to support His work AND live in a country where we get a tax break for it. Thanks for your generosity!</p></body></html>
