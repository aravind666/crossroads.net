<p>Forgiving</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Ephesians%204:32-5:2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4:32-5:2</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>One of Gods amazing characteristics is that he forgives. When we ask for forgiveness, He forgives so thoroughly that he never feels anger, bitterness or judgment. He doesnt create a black sheep list, no matter how ugly or frequent our mistakes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As incredible as this truth is, its often a hard one to believe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Be imitators of God, these verses from Ephesians tell us. Were able to imitate Gods ability to forgive when we believe were wholly forgiven. Were able to love when we believe were loved. We dont forgive and love out of our own power; we can only reflect what we have fully recognized and received from God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Today, give someone the benefit of the doubt. Extend grace, and in doing so, pay attention to how it feels.</p>
