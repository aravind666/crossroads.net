<p class="noPspace"><strong>Locate Your Hope</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God, teach me today the difference between hope and optimism--and help me place my hope with you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">Romans 8:17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Maybe your first reaction to this verse is, "Im not rich." You might even think, "Im not rich compared to _______." Lets recalibrate: If you make over $34,000 per year, you are in the richest one percent of the world. If you make less, but you have a computer or the opportunity to read a computer (or the ability to read) you are blessed. This blessing runs a risk, though--the risk of beginning to put your hope in provisions instead of the Provider.</p>

<p class="noPspace">You can put your hope in your stuff, but it is uncertain. You can even feel optimistic based on your stuff, but it all just doesnt last. Putting your hope in God is not a risk. Relocating your hope might feel risky as you build trust in God, but God doesnt just string us along or dangle a carrot. He is abundant.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take 10 minutes, and as fast as you can, write down 50 ways that God has provided for you. If you write down job and family, and begin to get stuck, push through. Ask God to reveal to you his hand in your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2013&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">John 13</a></p>
