<p class="normal noPspace">Last week’s US Census report indicated that the number of Americans struggling below the poverty line—44 million or one in seven—is the highest since the government began keeping track in 1959.  (See previous <a href="">blog post</a> for more info.)</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">It’s easy to cast off those national statistics and think that they’re not so relevant to us here in Cincinnati. However, poor people live right here in or near our neighborhoods. In fact, in 2008, Cincinnati was ranked the 10<sup>th</sup> poorest city in the United States according to a US Census Report from the <a href="">2007 American Community Survey</a>.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">A University of Cincinnati <a href="">study</a> indicates that Lower Price Hill, Over-the-Rhine, West End and Winton Hills are among the neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of poverty, many upwards of 50%.  Single moms and children make up 70% of these neighborhoods, where good housing, good schools and good job opportunities are hard to come by.  </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">But it’s not just the urban areas that are affected. The Brookings Institute’s study on <a href="">The Suburbanization of Poverty</a> found that poverty is fastest growing in the suburbs, and that Midwestern cities and suburbs experienced the largest poverty rate increase over the last decade. In the United Way’s <a href="">study</a> on how Cincinnati might change over the next ten years, they predict that poverty in our region will continue to rise in the short term, and the poverty in the suburbs will continue to rapidly spread.  </p>

<p class="normal noPspace">In Luke 10:27, Jesus tells us that the two greatest commandments are to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”</p>
