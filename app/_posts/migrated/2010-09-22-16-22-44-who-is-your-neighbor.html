<p class="normal noPspace">Last week&rsquo;s US Census report indicated that the number of Americans struggling below the poverty line&mdash;44 million or one in seven&mdash;is the highest since the government began keeping track in 1959.&nbsp; (See previous <a href="/blog/view/4/33">blog post</a> for more info.)</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">It&rsquo;s easy to cast off those national statistics and think that they&rsquo;re not so relevant to us here in Cincinnati. However, poor people live right here in or near our neighborhoods. In fact, in 2008, Cincinnati was ranked the 10<sup>th</sup> poorest city in the United States according to a US Census Report from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/acs-09.pdf">2007 American Community Survey</a>.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">A University of Cincinnati <a href="http://www.socialareasofcincinnati.org/">study</a> indicates that Lower Price Hill, Over-the-Rhine, West End and Winton Hills are among the neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of poverty, many upwards of 50%.&nbsp; Single moms and children make up 70% of these neighborhoods, where good housing, good schools and good job opportunities are hard to come by.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">But it&rsquo;s not just the urban areas that are affected. The Brookings Institute&rsquo;s study on <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/0120_poverty_kneebone.aspx">The Suburbanization of Poverty</a> found that poverty is fastest growing in the suburbs, and that Midwestern cities and suburbs experienced the largest poverty rate increase over the last decade. In the&nbsp;United Way&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.uwgc.org/index.cfm?page_id=123DA389-7E90-9BD4-C5614A3AB88688F3">study</a> on how Cincinnati might change over the next ten years, they&nbsp;predict that poverty in our region will continue to rise in the short term, and the poverty in the suburbs will continue to rapidly spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">In Luke 10:27, Jesus tells us that the two greatest commandments are to &ldquo;love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
