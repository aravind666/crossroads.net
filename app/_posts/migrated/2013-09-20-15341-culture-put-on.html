<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Culture: Put On</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out our look at a passage in Ephesians 4 this week by adding verse 24. Yesterday we took off the old self, today we clothe ourselves in something new.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:18-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4:18-24</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you, this week, have begun to deconstruct some old ways of doing things, you might begin to feel a little exposed. Dont fear, you dont have to stand naked. God wants to clothe you with all that he is. And with your new garment in place, made to be like Jesus, it gets easier and easier to see with his eyes.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Picture yourself having a choice between a heavy deceitful garment of the world, or a light Jesus garment. Try them both on, and journal about your decision.</p>
