<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New Courage: Love over Fear</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week expect to be encouraged. If you are taking on anything new, or considering taking new territory, you have to start by overcoming the fear that holds you back.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 John 4:18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God has a gift he wants to give you--fearlessness. God is love. Fear and love dont just hang out together. We cant be motivated by both love and fear. The more and more territory that you give God in your life (and heart), the more fear will exit.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If youre not sure whether an idea you have right now is motivated by love or fear, pause and assess. If an idea is from God, its motivated by love. If your idea is to try to control something or some situation, thats fear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you are not sure whether fear of love is motivating you in your life, choose that area and journal about it today. Ask God to reveal where he is moving in your life and where hes not.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"> Philippians 3</a></p>
