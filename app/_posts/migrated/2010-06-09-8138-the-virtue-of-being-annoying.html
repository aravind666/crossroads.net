<p>The Virtue of Being Annoying</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2018:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 18:1-7</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Pray like youre pestering God into helping you. If parables are pictures of what Gods kingdom looks like, this feels a bit strange. Its definitely not the impression of prayer that we generally expect from Jesus, is it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet it points to a deeper truth about the worldthat accomplishing anything substantial requires persistence and hard work. We know this to be true in the physical world, so it shouldnt come as a surprise that the same is true for the spiritual realm. Prayer is not a one-time request; it is an ongoing act requiring consistent effort in order to produce results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would Jesus give this picture of prayer? How does it make you feel?</li>
<li>Jesus also contrasts God to the unjust judge, saying that unlike the judge, God loves and cares about us. Which of the two feels more like the God you pray to? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is just a fancy religious word for talking to God; yet it is easy to have all kinds of baggage attached to it. Take a couple of minutes today and just talk to God about what is going on in your lifewhat you are thinking, feeling, believing, and so on. No agenda, no formula, just talk.</p>
