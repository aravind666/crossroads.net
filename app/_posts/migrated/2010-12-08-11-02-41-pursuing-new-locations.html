<p class="noPspace">Because of the incredible generosity our community has shown through Game Change commitments of over $47 million over the next three years, we’re pressing the go button on all four campaign initiatives, which means <strong>we’re actively pursuing strategic locations for Crossroads’ next sites.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">The commercial real estate market is complicated, and so <strong>we won’t be able to announce which location is next until we’ve already inked the deal.</strong> But rest assured that we’re investigating many opportunities for a new location in Greater Cincinnati. As soon as we’re able to reveal the location of the next site, we will do so!</p>
