<p class="noPspace">Because of the incredible generosity our community has shown through Game Change commitments of over $47 million over the next three years, we&rsquo;re pressing the go button on all four campaign initiatives, which means <strong>we&rsquo;re actively pursuing strategic locations for Crossroads&rsquo; next sites.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The commercial real estate market is complicated, and so <strong>we won&rsquo;t be able to announce which location is next until we&rsquo;ve already inked the deal.</strong> But rest assured that we&rsquo;re investigating many opportunities for a new location in Greater Cincinnati. As soon as we&rsquo;re able to reveal the location of the next site, we will do so!</p>
