<p>Dj Vu</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me experience your restoration today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway John 21:1-23" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2021:1-23&amp;version=NIV">John 21:1-23</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Peter knew it instantlythis had happened before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus told him to do something that didnt make sense, and in return his fishing team caught more fish than their boat could hold. So again, the fish phenomenon. But the dj vu wasnt over.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus asks Peter three times, Do you love me?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just days before, Peter explicitly denied his relationship to Jesus three times. Yet, Jesus returns to Peter. He returns and offers Peter forgiveness for something that must have been tearing Peter apart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is always restoration available for the one who wants to be restored.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Many times we carry around baggage from past failures for yearsnot because God hasnt forgiven us, but because we refuse to let it go. Take a few minutes and ask God if there are any areas where you need to forgive yourself. If He reveals something to you, spend some time asking him for the strength to forgive yourself and let it go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 28" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2028&amp;version=NIV">Acts 28</a></p>
