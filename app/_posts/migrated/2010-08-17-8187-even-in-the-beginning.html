<p>Even in the Beginning</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness in your life.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>You have probably heard this story beforeGod creates man, puts him in Paradise, and gives him one rule to follow. Man promptly breaks said rule, resulting in...well, the world we find ourselves in today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what does all this have to do with faithfulness?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Look back at verse 21 again. Before Adam and Eve left the garden, God made clothes for them. He has just sent them out of Paradise for breaking his one rule, and yet God kills an animal to make clothes for them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even at our worst, when we disobey and destroy all that God has made, he still cares.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He is still faithful.</p>
<ul>
<li>God still cares for us in the midst of our failuresin what ways is this hard for you to believe?</li>
<li>How has God been faithful to you in spite of your failures this month?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Our ability to see Gods faithfulness to us is often directly linked to our view of God himself. Take a few minutes and write down a description of how youve experienced Gods character. Then, ask Him to help you see more of his faithfulness to you today.</p>
