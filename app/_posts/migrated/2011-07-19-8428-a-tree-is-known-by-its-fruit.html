<p>A Tree is Known by its Fruit</p>
<p></p>
<p>God, purify my heart and grow your good fruit in me.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:43-45%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 6:43-45</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Imagine  if every conversation you had every day, all day, was one big job  interview. Keep smiling, have good posture, make eye contact. Say smart,  good things. Dont say stupid, bad things. Ask interesting questions,  dont tell dirty jokes. Seems exhausting, doesnt it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>No matter how hard we work at making a good impression, eventually the truth comes out. So the question is, what is  the truth? Jesus says here that anyone can see to the very core of us  by listening to us speak. Its inevitable. If we are cultivating our  hearts with spiritually healthy things, then our mouths will bear  delicious, inviting fruit. Rather than one big life interview, wouldnt  it feel so much better to be ourselves?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  the following questions and write down your answers: Why do you say the  things you do? Whats motivating your tongue to speak? Whats  motivating your tongue to remain silent?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%205&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 5</a></p>
