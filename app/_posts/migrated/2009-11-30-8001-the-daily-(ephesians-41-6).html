<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Monday, November 30</strong><br>Real Unity<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 4:1-6<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>After spending the first three chapters on how Jesus unites us with God, now Paul talks about what it looks like for us to be united with others. But he isnt talking about a fake, surface kind of unity that involves campfires and smores. This kind of unity takes work and recognizes the challenges of normal people in everyday relationships.<br><br>It starts with the words I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. This calling is the invitation to be united to God through faith in Jesus, and to allow that to change our relationships with others. <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Look again at verses 2-3. What are the marks of living a life worthy of the calling? Have you seen any growth in these areas lately? </li>
<li>Are any of these marks a struggle for you? Why do you think that is the case?</li>
<li>Whats one thing you can do this week to keep the bond of peace in your relationships?</li>
</ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>As you finish your time with God today, commit to doing something to promote the unity Paul talks about. If possible, focus on something that is sacrificial for you. Maybe its reconciling a severed friendship, or forgiving someone for an old wound. Whatever it is, choose to act <em>today</em>.</body></html>
