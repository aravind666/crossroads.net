<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET BEN</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"I have been mainly parented by God. He trained me how to recapture trust in him in spite of an erratic dad. I started by trying to recall painful interactions I had with my dad growing up. I then started asking God how he would have acted in those situations if he had been my earthly father. I was frequently surprised how different God would reveal himself to be from my Dad and the choices he made when I was growing up. God is consistent and unconditional in his love for me. Sometimes, when I meet someone who has let God be a Dad to them in this way, I realize how much I feel like they are my sibling."</p>
