<p>The Kingdom is Proclaimed</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God for the opportunity to notice and share the places where the Kingdom is breaking through in your life to others.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2010:1-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:1-9</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>You dont need a seminary degree to qualify for the mission of proclaiming the Kingdom; you simply need to notice the Kingdom and faithfully share what youre seeing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this scripture from Luke, Jesus asks 72 people to go ahead of him to the towns where he would later visit and let them know that the Kingdom of God is near. Jesus tells these 72 that the harvest is plenty, meaning there are always people seeking God, and we might get the opportunity to be the person who shares his message.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you notice the Kingdom, proclaim it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you been walking by opportunities to proclaim the Kingdom to someone? Ask God to give you the courage to proclaim to others how youve seen him working in your life. No speeches required.</p>
<p></p>
