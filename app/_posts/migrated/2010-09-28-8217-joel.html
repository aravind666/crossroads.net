<p>Joel</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Holy Spirit, show me today how I have let the world steal from me, and how you can return those things.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Joel%202:25-27&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Joel 2:25-27</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When Joel writes this book, a giant swarm of locusts have damaged the land. Through Joel, God conveys to his people that his righteous judgment and power is greater than that of the locusts. While the evil one (a.k.a. Satan) comes to steal, kill, and destroy like these locustsGod is our stronghold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We exist in a world where were constantly nibbled away at by the plans of the evil one who wants to rob our freedom and destroy our intimacy with God. But God wants to restore us. His desire is that we live out the fullness of who he created us to be, and that we sit under his daily watering and pruning. As we do, we become more and more locust-proof.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reveal the areas of your life where you are worn down, and then ask God to restore the years the locust have taken.</p>
<p></p>
