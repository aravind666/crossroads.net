<p>Mrs. Apple</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, show me where Im holding onto my failures and not living in the fullness of your grace.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:1-24&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 3:1-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its easy to read the story of Eve and Adam as one of miserable failureand little else. But underneath this often-told story of two humans who screw up is the story of Gods shocking grace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We all know failure. But do we know it like Eve? In one moment, she spirals from utopia to the dark underbelly of worldly brokenness. She unleashes never-before-felt pain. She gets barraged by the lies of the world. She awakens the reality of death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So with that magnitude of failure in mind, youd expect Adam would have plenty of names for her. Plenty of curses and blame. Or maybe youd expect that God would revoke Adams naming privileges and jump in with his own name for this woman. But Adam, reflecting Gods intense mercy, takes this momentpost-failureto name her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eve: Mother of the Living. Its a show of Gods grace.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Read Genesis 3:21 again. Grace is no light gesture, no afterthought from a sympathetic god. Consider a moment when youve felt the the weight of grace. Or if youve never felt grace, consider when, exactly, youve felt the lack of it. Was it tied to another persons reaction, to your opinion of God, to your own inability to receive grace?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 3</a></p>
