<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Spiritual Parents: Send</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spiritual parenting is Gods intent for reproduction. We continue today looking at how we are to be children in our faith who grow up into parents. Focus on verse 17.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:14-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 4:14-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul was not Timothys biological parent, but he was his spiritual parent. Paul was sent to start the church through traveling and spreading the gospel. He had Timothy imitate him, until Timothy was ready to go out and try it without Paul. Timothy is brought to maturity by being sent. Paul doesnt cut ties in the sending (he knows he can coach from afar) but he releases him to learn by doing.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write today about areas of your life that you would not want someone to imitate, and then write about people who could possibly parent you into maturity.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 6</a></p>
