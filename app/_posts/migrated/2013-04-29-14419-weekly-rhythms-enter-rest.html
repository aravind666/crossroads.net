<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Friday, May 3</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Sheesh, Gods tough: demanding that we take a break and just enjoy being. We finish out our week looking at Gods desire for us to embrace the Sabbath.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:8-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 4:8-11</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Hebrews is presenting that Sabbath is not over now that Jesus has come, its still a go. There is a parallel with God giving rest to the Israelites in the desert: he gave the Israelites rest to train them how to receive the goodness of Sabbath when they came to the promised land. We can choose to experience Sabbath weekly, just like the Israelites, as our training for eternity. If we resist Gods good gifts now, what do you think our response will be to heaven?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take time today to plan a Sabbath. Decide what you would want it to look like. If you are a part of a family, text or email your spouse or kids to decide a time to discuss what eachl of you want for Sabbath and how you can experience it together.</p>
