<html><body><p>Brian Tome recently taught at our weekly Staff Training about big-picture changes he sees happening in culture. His teaching preceded a time of "big prayer" in which our staff prayed for big, seemingly impossible things that we'd like to see God do in our city, country and world. <br><br><strong>Since we're all one team around here</strong> (paid staff + unpaid staff who happen to get their paychecks somewhere else), we thought we'd make this teaching available to the whole team.
