<p>After the January earthquake in Haiti, Crossroads responded by contributing $120,000 to the <a href="">Restavek Foundation</a> to aid in rebuilding efforts.We just received word about how the foundation is using the money to help with immediate needs. So far, the foundation has used our contributions to:</p>
<p><br>         •    Set up schools and temporary classrooms serving 1,160 kids<br>         •    Organize ongoing food distribution serving more than 5,000 people<br>         •    Purchase vehicles to transport food and supplies<br>         •    Repair a transitional home serving 30 kids<br>         •    Built security walls around their schools.</p>
<p><br>They also plan to set up six more schools this month, which will serve another 1,000 children, and they will continue using contributions from Crossroads to meet immediate and long-term needs on the ground in Haiti.<br><br></p>
