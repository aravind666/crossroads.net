<p class="normal noPspace">As many of you know, we have been working with <a title="OneSight website" href="http://www.onesight.org">OneSight </a>over the past  two weeks to deliver world-class eye care to people in Mamelodi. Our  goal was to see10,000 people over two weeks.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Today, with one day still  to go, we reached 10,700! Thats 10,700 people who received a full eye  exam to rival anything one might receive from an eye doc here in  Cincinnati, complete with prescription glasses and sunglasses. Most  importantly, over a dozen people were diagnosed with some type of  condition or disease that, left untreated, would most likely lead to  blindness. They now have a great chance to keep their sight. Last week, we had a team of 17 people from Crossroads working  alongside the OneSight team.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">To give you an idea  of what is happening, <a title="Video from Mamelodi" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVzZC1Uc7V8">check out this video</a> of the line that Jason shot  this morning. When the team arrived at 7am, there were easily 1,000 people already  in line, and some had arrived as early as 2am. This demonstrates  how desperate the people of Mamelodi are for good eye care and how  powerful something like this can be.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">On Friday, Pastor Titus, our key partner in Mamelodi, told me  that he has never had this many people come  up to him and tell him that they cannot believe what is happening at  Charity &amp; Faith, that something this good is actually happening in  the township. Titus declared that this is so big that no one in  Mamelodi can ignore it and deny that God is moving in Mamelodi. In  fact, this week, multiple government officials, who previously denied us  assistance with the clinics, showed up with their families to have  their own eyes checked. This is a huge win for what were all doing in South Africa.You can read more on <a title="OneSight Blog" href="http://www.onesight.org/na/get_inspired/onesight_blogs/current_blogs/south_africa_clinic_blog/">OneSights blog.</a></p>
