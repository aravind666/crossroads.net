<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Thursday, December 3</strong><br>A New Way to Relate<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 4:25-5:2<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Whenever you see the word therefore (like in Ephesians 4:25), its a clue what is coming next is related to something that has been mentioned before. In this case, therefore is connected to receiving Jesus and then submitting to his teaching over time (Ephesians 4:21-24). Receiving Jesus makes us new people, and empowers us to respond differently in relationships. In essence, through Jesus we are freed from the things that divide us and can once again approach relationships the way that God intended.<br><br>Re-read Ephesians 4:25-32. <br></p>
<ul>
<li>What characteristics are parts of relationships as God intended? </li>
<li>Based on what came before (remember the therefore is connected to receiving and submitting to Jesus), what are some ways we can go about fostering these characteristics in our own relationships?</li>
</ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>The new life Paul describes is founded on relationship with Jesus. Ask God to help you receive more of him and not just focus on weeding out sin. Also ask Him to show you how to live out this new life so that you can give more of yourself in relationships.</body></html>
