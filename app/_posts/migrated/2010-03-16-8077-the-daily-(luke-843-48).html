<p>Blahs + Breaks</p>
<p><em><br>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This past weekend, we talked about four stages we go through on our journey toward freedom: the Blahs, Breaks, Blues and Blessings. Sometimes we dont realize were in the Blahs simply because we assume our situation is unchangeable. Is there any place in your life where youre making assumptions about the way things have to be, and living in a general state of apathy? What action could you take, as a measure of faith, to begin claiming the freedom God wants for you?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reveal areas of your life where youre living by assumptions rather than by his truth.</p>
