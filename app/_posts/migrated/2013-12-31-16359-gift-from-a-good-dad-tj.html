<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">On the first day of the year its easy to make drastic, rapid plans for how this year will be different, how this year everything will change. That might be true, but Gods timing is different. Today, read TJs story about Gods timing. And this year, trust His timing to be good.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>TJS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I wasnt thrilled with in my job. It didnt feel satisfying or fulfilling. So I started praying about and looking for a new job. One happened to come up that I was really excited about, and I landed an interview. However, every time I prayed about it I felt God telling me this wasnt the job for me. I was crushed that He gave me a "No." But I also heard Him tell me to stay where I was until Christmas.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I passed up on a job that I really wanted. I wanted to listen to God more. I wondered if anything would actually happen because time was running out on the Christmas deadline. Wanting to believe that God is a good dad who follows through, I kept waiting. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">One day I got a phone call from a company who had specifically pulled me out of a stack of resumes. A couple weeks later I was offered that job on the spot during my second interview just five days before Christmas.</p>
