<p><strong>Thursday, May 12 </strong><br>The Spirit of Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to keep your mind and heart open to his teaching.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%208:5-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:5-6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>A mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we set our minds on what Gods Spirit desires for us, we let go of trying to fight alone. We quit obsessing about the future and we rest in knowing that God is the full answer and the perfect provider.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The battle between peace and chaos isnt easy. Our "old self" will tempt us to hold tight to control, to be our own answer, and to question Gods power and love. But when we ground ourselves in the Spirit and let go of our fear and pride, the fruit of the struggle is peace.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are there parts of your life where you feel at peace and parts where you dont? Consider what might be contributing to the difference.</p>
