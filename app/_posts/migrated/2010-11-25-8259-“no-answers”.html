<p>No Answers</p>
<p></p>
<p>God, please help me to reflect your character of peace. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2023:4-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 23:4-6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>C.S. Lewis wrote a book, A Grief Observed, as a way to process the death of his best friend, his wife. A man who seemed unshakable and has inspired countless people to follow Jesus was rocked by grief and questioned God in ways he never had. This is something he wrote near the end of the book:</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I lay [my] questions before God I get no answer. But a rather special sort of No answer. It is not the locked door. It is more like a silent, certainly not uncompassionate, gaze. As though He shook His head not in refusal but waiving the question. Like, Peace, child; you dont understand.</p>
<p>Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable. How many hours are there in a mile? Is yellow square or round? Probably half the questions we askhalf our great theological and metaphysical problemsare like that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Often, we dont feel peace because we cant figure something out. We dont understand the why, the how, the when. But what Lewis is saying is that our minds are one-dimensional compared to the complex mind of God. (Is yellow square or round?) If we rest in that fact--if we take comfort in Gods all-knowingness in every situation--peace is a natural outpouring.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Look at what you wrote on Tuesday that troubles your mind, then reread Lewis quote. Write down any thoughts that cross your mind.</p>
