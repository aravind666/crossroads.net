<p><strong>Wednesday, February 10</strong><br>For Freedom</p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ</strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:1&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><br>Galatians 5:1</a><br>(Click to view the scripture online.)<em><br><br></em></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Doesnt that sound a little redundant? Isnt that like saying, It is to have milk that I went to the store to buy milk? Well, not really. Paul is saying that Jesus has set us free so we are released to keep pursuing freedom in all of its forms. Freedom isnt a one-time act. Its something we must continue to receive from God and fight to keep in our life. It is Gods destiny for us, and the underlying story of the Bible.</p>
<p>The freedom that God desires for us can only be understood and applied through relationship with him. The more we learn about who God is and what he cares about, the more we will recognize true freedom and bondage in all its forms. And then we become more and more able to align our lives with freedom, and fight for the freedom of others.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you define freedom in your life? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Think of a time when you felt like you were experiencing freedom. How would you describe the effect it had on your behavior and how you interacted with the people around you?<br><br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask God to teach you what freedom means, the way he sees it. Ask Him to reveal an area in your life where you are less than free, and to help show you what you can do about it. Write it down.</p>
