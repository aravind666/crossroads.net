<p>Check Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to invite God to remind you of times in your life when hes been generous and loving to you. Listen. Write them down. And then listen some more, because there will be more to write down.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2026:1-46&amp;version=NIV">Leviticus 26:1-46</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>At first glance, the book of Leviticus might not conjure up visions of Gods generosity, but this passage is a great picture of it. If the Israelites obey God, he promises them unparalleled success and prosperity. If they dont, its another story. But take some time to go back and look specifically at verses 3-13 againmaybe in a bible translation like the Message.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God is offering his people some pretty impressive rewards. All He asks is that they love him right back by being obedient. And God still wants obedience from his children, from us. (Thats a pretty high priority on any parents list.) But He also loves lavishing love on you just because youre his.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What if obedience was just a natural response to that kind of outpouring of love?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to increase your gratitude and your ability to recognize his generosity in your life. Today, take notice of the moments where God showers you with love, whether its a great parking spot or a kind word from a friend. Write these down and thank God at the end of the day for the ways, big and small, he blesses you.</p>
