<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Know Your Audience</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to follow the book of Acts and how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you understand the people of influence in your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+22%3A22-28&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 22:22-28</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul did what a lot of us do: he said some really personal things to the wrong people. While he knew the crowd was angry, and no matter what he said theyd probably be upset, he hoped his personal story would make them come around. They didnt. They had him arrested without a fair trial. But Paul found an audience in the Roman guards who were supposed to beat him. When they found out he was a Roman citizen by birth, they decided to at least give him the trial he deserved.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How would you share your personal story with two different audiences, like a family member and a co-worker? Think about how you would tell it based on who they are, what they already know about you and what you know about them. Journal about it or if you feel a nudge to tell your story, go and do it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+22&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 22</a></p>
