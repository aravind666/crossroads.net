<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The Humility to Change</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week were spending time with God and with people we trust to find out how we can change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to surround you with people you can trust.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A1-5&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:1-5</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23%3A12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 23:12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were really good at telling other people what to do. Its not very often that we allow others---friends, family or coworkers---to give us feedback, especially the hard-to-hear kind. But sometimes the best place for us to receive feedback or even criticism is from the people we trust. Its still not an easy thing to do, but we must choose to be humble and receive whatever they tell us if we really want to change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, submit yourself to a person you trust. Ask them to give you guidance or feedback for whatever it is you want to change or improve.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 4</a></p>
