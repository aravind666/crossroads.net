<p><strong>Week One: Fruits of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, May 9 </strong><br>The Spirit of Overflow</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to keep your mind and heart open to his teaching.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:16-26&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=printo&amp;interface=print"> Galatians 5:16-26</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When we experience joy, peace, goodness, patience, gentleness, love, faithfulness and self-control--were experiencing God. These arent things we conjure up on our own, or muster the strength to achieve. They are the outpouring of a deepening relationship with Him. It is His Holy Spirit permeating our life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While our old selves (pre-Jesus) might want us to retaliate against people who hurt us, seek attention in unhealthy ways, maintain high-control and build up walls of independenceit is Gods Spirit who gives us the power to release anger, to be motivated by love, and to live with open-handed faith.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the next two weeks, well look at the power of the Holy Spirit and how it guides us. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a quick inventory of where you think you are with each of the fruits of the Spirit. Possibly, one stuck out to you. Keep that word in mind these next couple weeks, considering where it could play out.</p>
<p><strong><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2013&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 13</a></p>
