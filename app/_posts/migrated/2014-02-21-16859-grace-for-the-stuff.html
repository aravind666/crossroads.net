<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Grace for the Stuff</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to share with you his grace and truth for an area of your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">JOHN 1:14</a></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve all got stuff we carry with us. If we decide to just accept that well always carry it, then were not growing in relationship with Jesus. When He came, he gave grace and truth to everyone in every situation. Remember, the goal is to model our lives after Him. This week, well explore how we can let go of our stuff and give grace and truth to ourselves <em>and</em> each other in the midst of hard situations.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What stuff do you carry with you? If it helps, make a list and then ask God for a step or two toward letting it go.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 4</a></p>
