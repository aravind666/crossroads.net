<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>There is no better feeling than the first taste of freedom. Its important in these times to remember that its God who delivers us from our chains (not just our own work or the support of friends) and to express gratitude for what he has done. Are there places in your life where youre experiencing a measure of freedom? Give thanks.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Thank God for the blessing of freedom he has brought--and will continue to bring--into your life.</p>
<p></p>
