<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: Mikes Practice</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">To end the week, Mike shares his story of speaking positively for one whole day.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to prepare you for whatever he has in store for you today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3%3A1-12&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">James 3:1-12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I never fully realized this until now, but apparently my default communication from day to day is biting sarcasm. I work with teenage boys all day as a teacher and Athletic Trainer and they tend to talk this way with each other, so it has slowly morphed into a way I converse with most people in my life. This is not great. This needs to change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">It took all of my power to communicate yesterday in positive and encouraging tones with my students and colleagues. When the default mechanism is to want to be seen as funny, its not Christ-like. Its not life-building. I get to have that impact day to day with young men, but I waste that opportunity sometimes trying to be seen as hilarious. Im in my thirties, time to grow up.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I had five separate conversations that were amazingly uplifting and positive because I went into the day thinking Im staying positive all day. What? Why dont I do this every day? In my quiet time that morning I was reading <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13%3A1-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">John 13</a>, the part about Jesus washing the disciples feet, and thought to myself, I can serve my students and my colleagues more than I do---treating them like Jesus treated his disciples. Its not easy, but its good. Its so good. I will continue to remind myself to stay positive and build others up with my tongue, not break them down every day. Ill see how it goes, but no more gossiping-negativity-evil-angry tongue for even a week may due my body real good.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">From here on out youre going to encounter plenty of opportunities to use bad words or good words. Make it your challenge this weekend (and longer if you want) to hold your tongue and to build others up with authentic encouragement.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 15</a></p>
