<p class="noPspace"><strong>Evangelism: It Springs from Us</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were learning about evangelism by studying Pauls words to the Colossians.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>"We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all his people--<strong>the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true word of the gospel that has come to you.</strong>In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world--just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood Gods grace.You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,and who also told us of your love in the Spirit."</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Colossians 1:3-8<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001n4Suzny7HYG_IX7tU8x_NB215WLNN1CODBeGvjiS1vB8_xiwYejIQDDZLlwEkNnBmrWVkxXgEcJMblEk6cI14kIJ8KU5aSaUiSin6cHkcYDJxUIcdgbEWbTZrB2G8dRl6viYoTOmdc1yus7m93gFfiwxd2OwQwL6xZwMxnVpDQubhKTOK_zy_A==" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>The most compelling way we can share about the good news of Jesus is by sharing the personal mark hes made on our own lives. Like it was for the Colossians, sharing the good news becomes a sweet compulsion--a story that naturally springs from us.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>What kind of mark is Jesus making on you this year? Put it into words, because its a compelling story that others will want to hear.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
