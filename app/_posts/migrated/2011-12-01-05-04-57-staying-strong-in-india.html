<p class="noPspace">Justice work never takes a vacation. And no one knows this better than the staff of our first partner in India, International Justice Mission (IJM). The focus of our most recent GO India trips to Kolkata and Mumbai was to help refresh, renew and re-energize this team and their families by serving them at their annual staff retreats.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kolkata Trip: October 1-10</strong></span></p>
<p class="noPspace">The Crossroads team wasted no time immersing themselves into the heart of this city with a visit to the home of Mother Teresa. They prayed at her tomb, read her manuscripts and were blessed with the opportunity to interact with children at the Missionaries of Charity Orphanage. The second day was spent at the Mahima aftercare and transitional homes for girls and young women rescued from sex trafficking. Here the team watched in amazement as the girls expertly used tools from the embroidery gift bags they brought, then shared lunch with 20 girls and 24 staff members. Trip participant Colleen Kearney reflects, “We all walked out feeling energized about the Game Change commitments we made, and happy there will soon be more homes so more girls can know what wholeness and healing feels like.”</p>

<p class="noPspace">The second half of the trip was dedicated to the IJM retreat, serving those who devote their lives to running after freedom for others. Our team prepared separate experiences for 54 adults and children. The children transitioned from shy to engaged as they played with bubbles, soccer balls, arts and crafts, while the IJM staff and spouses went from communion, receiving individual prayer from the Crossroads team and being prostrate on the floor in prayer to smiling, laughing and leaning into each other during a session on joy. It was an amazing transformation from their delicate morale after a recently failed raid due to a tip off. Colleen summarizes, “They were role models for submitting to one another, those in authority and to us—I don’t even have words; it was beautiful.”</p>

<p class="noPspace">Finally, the team had the privilege of touring Freeset, a fair trade business offering employment to women trapped in Kolkata’s sex trade. The team was inspired by the women worshipping together every morning before getting to work cutting fabric, sewing and printing jute bags and t-shirts.  </p>

<p class="noPspace"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mumbai Trip: October 21-28</strong></span></p>
<p class="noPspace">While the Crossroads team in Mumbai shared many of the same activities as the Kolkata team, they had some unique experiences of their own. The team was inspired by the justice heroes in this city in a number of ways: worshipping with the Andheri Baptist Church, taking prayer walks through neighborhoods with pastors, and drawing faces and dancing (including the electric slide) with the 116 girls in the Rescue Foundation aftercare home. They were especially touched hearing the girls sing the familiar song they taught them, “He makes beautiful things.”</p>

<p class="noPspace">Once again, the IJM retreat proved to be an experience of both giving and receiving for the Crossroads team. They worshipped, shared stories, wept and prayed with the IJM staff. Trip participant Christine Wilson sums up their experience with IJM, “Their requests were close to the heart of God, not for new things or personal needs, but to reach their nation for Christ, and to understand and see him more. Their faith has inspired me to know the Lord more deeply and walk in obedience in what I learn.”</p>
