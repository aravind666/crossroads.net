<p>The Beginning of Freedom</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%208:31-36&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 8:31-36</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This past weekend we discussed how were all tethered to something. Many of the things that tether us actually keep us from the freedom God intends, but we often dont realize it. And if we dont realize how were in bondage, we wont seek freedom because well assume we already have it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember: The beginning of freedom is knowing how youre in bondage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reveal to you one way that youre not free. (Maybe Hes beginning to show this to you, already, via your Free guide.) Pray specifically for God to bring you into freedom in that area of your life.</p>
