In case you missed the announcement this weekend, Crossroads is adding a fifth service in Oakley this fall. <strong>Beginning September 12, </strong>services will take place at <strong>4&#58;30 and 6&#58;15pm</strong> <strong>on Saturday nights.</strong>&nbsp; To make this additional service possible, we need your help. <a href=\"../engage\" title=\"Crossroads Engage\">Sign up to serve</a> here. (Sunday service times will remain the same in Oakley and Mason.)
