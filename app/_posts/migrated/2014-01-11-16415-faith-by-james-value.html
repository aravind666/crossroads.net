<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: Value</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to share with you something you didnt know about his character.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:1-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If what we just read sounds like a vague item to add to a list of religious dos and donts, stop right there. James isnt laying down any religious hooplah---hes talking about where we find our security and value. When we are faithful we find it in Gods promises, and our lives and the world look very different. This week, with James help well continue to look at what it means to act on our faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whats something that brings you joy? Thats Gods way of telling you how much he loves and values you. Today, make time to do something that fills you up.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 6</a></p>
