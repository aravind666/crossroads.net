For those who haven't heard, there's a Prayer Experience happening <strong>now through Saturday, March 15th</strong> at Crossroads. It is designed to be a simple, personal prayer journey with an audio guide to help you engage with God. It's great for those who have never prayed, or for those who pray everyday.<br /><br /> The experience is designed to last about an hour, but you can take as much time as you'd like.<br /><br /><strong>Prayer Experience Times (just show up) &#58;</strong><br />Sunday, March 9&#58; 2-8&#58;30pm<br />Monday, March 10-Thursday, March 13&#58; 7&#58;30am-8&#58;30pm<br />Friday, March 14&#58; 6&#58;30am-8&#58;30pm<br />Saturday, March 15&#58; 7&#58;30am-2pm<br /><br /><strong>Childcare will be provided&#58;</strong><br />Tuesday, March 11&#58; 5&#58;30-9pm <br />Wednesday, March 12&#58; 5&#58;30-9pm<br />Saturday, March 15&#58; 9am-1pm<br /><br />Have you already been through it? <strong>Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.</strong>
