<p>No Fear</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please give me a spirit of boldness, and use me to speak life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Timothy 1:7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When  our tongue is not serving the Holy Spirit, its often motivated by  fear. Consider how many stories there are in the Bible about someone  lying because they were afraid: Abrahams wife, Sarah, was afraid and  denied she had laughed. Peter was afraid and denied knowing Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Put Simply, fear will motivate us to be silent when God wants us to speak.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There  is great blessing and discipline in the ability to be quiet, or to mind  our own business. But if fear is driving our silence, then we may be  robbing others of the life-giving words that God wants to speak through  us. Even worse, we are being robbed of an opportunity to get more of  God. Take courage and consider how God might want to use you and your  tongue to build the Kingdom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write  about a time when you felt you should speak up, but were afraid and  didnt. What happened? What do you think would have happened if you had  spoken? Is this a pattern in your life? Today, ask God to redeem your  fearful tongue. Whenever you feel afraid to speak, speak anyway.</p>
<p></p>
