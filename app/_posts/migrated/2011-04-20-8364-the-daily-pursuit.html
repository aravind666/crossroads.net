<p>The Daily Pursuit</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, give me the strength to make choices for freedom every day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2019:1-5&amp;version=NIV">1 Kings 19:1-5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The backstory here is that Elijah was willing to stand alone for God in the midst of a crowd that was mocking himand in front of hundreds of pagan priests willing to murder him. Yet, in the moments following his amazing triumph, it seems hes in absolute terror at the anger of one woman. So while days earlier Elijah had stood fearlessly in the freedom that a relationship with God offers, soon after he is cowering in a cave.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Freedom isnt a one-time decision or a fleeting experience. Its a daily, moment-by-moment choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Many times, it only takes one persons disapproval or interference for us to get distracted from the freedom God offers. Is anyone distracting you from Gods freedom right now? Ask God to help you in that relationship, and to remove what needs to be removed.</p>
