<p>If you were around last weekend you heard about the new feature on Crossroads.net called "Recently Mentioned." If you hear anything announced on the weekend but can't remember where to go to learn more, you can always visit <a href="">crossroads.net/mentioned</a> to get the details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to sign-up opportunities for serving, groups and Crossroads events, you can also get more information about books mentioned in the message, songs played by the band and more.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
