<p>Loyal</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2013:5-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 13:5-6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God is always present in our lives. We can choose whether or not we want to be in a relationship with Him, but even if we dont follow God, he is with us everywhere, and he will never turn away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe youve heard someone tell a story and say, And then God showed up. This implies God must have stepped away at some point and then made another entrance. Yet, He never steps away. God is always present. We just have to choose to meet Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>In Hebrews 13, God is telling us that were never alone. In what part of your life do you need to feel more of His presence? Tell God you want him to reveal himself to you, and that you need help believing hes involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
