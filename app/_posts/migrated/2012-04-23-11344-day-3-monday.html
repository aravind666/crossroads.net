<p class="noPspace">The Work Begins.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">After two days of easing into life in Mumbai, the sun broke  beautiful this morning as we grabbed breakfast and huddled together to  pray and worship before our first day of "work." While Brandon will  provide some play by play of our day, Id rather focus on some color  commentary on the team in general.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Crossroads, you have an outstanding group of  representatives on the ground here in Mumbai. I couldnt be more pleased  with how people have adapted to the environment, pitched in to help,  and havent grumbled a bit. Theyve truly been a joy to work alongside,  and Im thankful theyve made the role so easy. Today at the conclusion  of our time at the aftercare home the superintendent made a special  point to publicly thank this group for the way they integrated with the  girls, and genuinely connected in the time they were given. Theyre a  blessing over here, without a doubt.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">On our way to the home I spent time with the  founder of Crossover, Keith Desouza. Keith is a tremendous man, and its  an honor to know and serve underneath him. He was telling our group of a  recent rescue another partner (IJM) had just performed. Friends, the God we serve is bigger, more powerful, and more awesome than we could ever imagine. He is the best aftercare provider ever.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Good night friends.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Its been a wonderful day (as detailed by Brandon below).</p>

<p class="noPspace">---------------------    <em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>From Brandon:</em> <em><br></em> <em>Where to begin, oh  where to begin. Days like today are difficult to put into words, but for  right now, Ill do my best to convey the group experience. Starting off  our morning, after breakfast and plenty of coffee, the group all  converged in our hotels beautiful conference room, where we were led in  prayer and worship by the wonderful and amazing Andy Reider. Through  song, our emotions were put through the test as we bowed our heads and  prayed aloud as the Holy Spirit swept through the room. I dont know if I  haveeverfelt as full or enriched with the Holy  Spirit more than when Andy sang this morning with the group backing him  up. We took our time with any individual prayers that came to mind and  dismissed off to the cars on an extremely high note. Inspiring and  powerful would be an understatement.</em> <em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em> <em>Afterwards, charged up and ready to take on the world,  our group headed out for a long drive to our first aftercare home,  stopping along the way for lunch at a wonderful restaurant that highly  expanded our flavor palates. This was our first real chance to eat with  our hands and get a little dirty with our food, and every serving (there  were quite a few) was pretty delicious.</em> <em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em> <em><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; color: #222222;">After  lunch, charged and fed, we were ready for our first home visit, nerves  ran high for all as we drove down the dusty roads and took off our shoes  at the doorstep before entering. Gathered in what might be considered  the living room, the girls soon entered, some with shy faces and  apprehension, others with beaming smiles and warm welcomes. Though some  girls were clearly farther along in their recovery process than others,  we all sat down in small groups of 3-4 to make some crafts and converse  as much as we could. Personally, as a man entering this home, my  expectations on what was to come, as far as interactions go, were low.  These girls have been through more than any person ever should, and if  they wanted to completely reject and ignore us, what more could any of  us guys expect? However, in our groups, though some were shy, the smiles  started to come out, and the shells began to break for almost everyone.  In my personal small group, myself, Paula and Tiana, had the pleasure  of two wonderful girls to interact with. Our first girl, I shall call  her Mary, barely spoke any English at all, and was at first very  apprehensive to the three of us, even though we had some staff around to  translate, then we had another girl join the group. Well call her  Sarah. Sarah had one of the mostcontagioussmiles I have ever seen, and  with a little bit of joking about my mispronunciation of her name, we  made personal journals and flower pens, even Mary began to enjoy  herself. Though I could never mention to the girls personally how  beautiful they are, I felt it on my heart that they were truly a  blessing to be with us. As I stole a glance at the scars, tattoos, burns  and marks on the girls arms, I could not describe the emotions that  flashed through my mind as I played along with them and watch them open  up to a room full of strange Americans.</span></em> <em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em> <em>Once done with crafts, the girls had an area set up  with crafts and bags they had personally made, and the whole group was  given the pleasure of shopping through the items and purchasing anything  that stood out. To see the faces as they counted the wads of cash we  handed over, just knowing that what they had made had a sense of value  to someone, was something that will stick in my mind forever. Im  honored to say that both Mary and Sarah are excellent with their math  skills and money exchange and handled most of the transfers for the  whole group. I knew them for an hour, and I was already proud. </em> <em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em> <em>After shopping we still werent done, and were  treated to a group dance that several of the girls lead. To see us funny  Americans try to dance along with them gave them much pleasure and  plenty to talk about in their home language. As a special treat to them,  a male dance team soon assembled (with myself included), led and  choreographed by Mike, we all used our best moves and provided memories  for the onlookers of both nations. The dance was capped off by Mike  doing the worm across the marble floors, to the applause and shouts of  all.</em> <em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em> <em>Today is a day that I will never forget for the rest  of my life. I am confident in saying that every person on this trip has  been changed for the better as a result of the short time we spent with  these young girls, and we can only hope that they were able to take  some small pleasure away from having us. We drove away this evening, as  the girls leaned over the fence and waved goodbyes, wishing we could  stay. Before we stepped out the door, Mary stood up in front of everyone  in the room, and through a translator, made a declaration about her new  American friends. She acknowledged how far we had traveled, and gave us  a warm thanks for all we had done for them. She said we gave them a day  of pleasure and many memories, and I cant help but think, than none of  us will forget those girls and all they have shown us. </em> <em><br></em> <em></em></p>
