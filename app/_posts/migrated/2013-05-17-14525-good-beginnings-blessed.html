<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good Beginnings: Blessed</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week The Daily is going back to the beginning. Weve just started a new weekend series called Good Sex, and were going to look at what God created for us as man and woman in the beginning.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:27-28&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 1:27-28</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When God made mankind, he didnt make a nation, he made two people. He made one garden and two people and then blessed them to join with Him in the rest of the creating. What a blessing of trust and relationship he designed for us. He first made us in his image, and then he started it all with a blessing. He blessed us to have sex and to reign. What a good (and fun) God to create sex and give us authority.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Sex in our culture frequently feels connected to brokenness. Thats our fault, not Gods. Take a moment right now and clear your mind, then reread the verse for today as a blessing being given to you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2025&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 25</a></p>
