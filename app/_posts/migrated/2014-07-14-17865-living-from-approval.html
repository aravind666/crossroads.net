<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Living from Approval</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><em>This summer, were revisiting some classic Daily topics. Even if you have a photographic memory, these are worth digesting again. (Also, youre <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/i-developed-what-appears-to-be-a-ph/">probably lying</a>.)</em></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, well look at receiving Gods approval (turns out its way simpler than we think). This is a continuation of the past few weeks studies as we consider our identities as Gods treasured children.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, help me to be open to receiving your approval.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%203:16-17&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 3:16-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This is one of Jesus greatest examples of how we can live as treasured children of God. Jesus began his ministry on earth knowing that his heavenly Father loved him and was already proud of him. Simply put, Jesus lived from a place of approval, rather than living for approval.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about how working for the approval of others figures into your daily life. How might your day today look different if you knew youve already earned all the approval youll ever need?</p>
