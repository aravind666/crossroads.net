<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">We will finish our week of looking at Jesus speaking on money and resources in Matthew. Focus on verse 24 today.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">READ</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a style="line-height: 1.75;" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:19-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 6:19-24</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">You have evaluated your resources this week and noted what has your eye. This last verse brings it all together with a powerful punch. We can spend a lot of time assessing our resources and our use of time. We can feel like there is room for growth in what has our attention, and in giving of resources, but Jesus uses stronger language. Evaluation is the right place to start, but we can not live in the gray. We must begin to make decisions and move toward God holistically.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">RESPOND</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Today, look back over your evaluation from the week, and ask God to point out an area where he wants you to move.</span></p>
