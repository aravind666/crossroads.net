<img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/2008PigLogo.jpg\" alt=\"Flying Pig\" hspace=\"5\" width=\"135\" height=\"139\" align=\"right\" />This weekend every year we experience something akin to <strong>traffic armageddon</strong> in Cincinnati. It's the weekend in which police go around randomly closing streets and forcing cars like mice into mazes. For most, it's a losing game. But for the prepared, it's simply not a problem.<br /><br />Before leaving the house this Sunday, make sure you've checked the <a href=\"http&#58;//www.flyingpigmarathon.com/race_information/course/\">Flying Pig Marathon Route</a> to see which of your local streets will be closed. Trust me... you definitely do <em>not </em>want to miss the service this weekend...
