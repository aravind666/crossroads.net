<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The beggar at the temple probably had no idea what was in store for him that day. Sitting near the gates of the temple was a great place to be noticed, but no one ever got involved. They walked right by him. But when Peter and John came, instead of ignoring him or just giving him a few coins, they looked him straight in the eye and personally got involved. The beggars life was forever different.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Peter and John got involved with what was right in front of them. Whats looking you straight in the eye at work, at school or at home? Today, take a step toward getting personally involved.</p>
