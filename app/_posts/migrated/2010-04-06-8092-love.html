<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>Tuesday, April 6<br></strong>Love</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em><br>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2013:8-10%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 13:8-10</a> <strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">When Jesus was asked which is the greatest commandment, he simply replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind (Matthew 22:36-37). The second, he said, is that we love our neighbors as much as we love ourselves.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><br>Love fulfills every other law. If you love God and love your neighbor, you wont desire to steal, cause harm, act in envy. None of us is capable of giving perfect love, but as we draw close to Gods Spirit, love will pour out of us.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><br>Without love, we have nothing. With love, we live.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Whats one action you could take to change an unloving behavior or attitude? Ask Gods Spirit to fill you with the love you need to follow through on it. <strong></strong></p>
