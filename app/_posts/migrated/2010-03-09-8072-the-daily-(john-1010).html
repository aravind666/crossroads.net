<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus says there is a thief who wants to steal our freedom and block us from Gods truth. As unnerving as that may sound, the story doesnt end there. Jesus has come to beat this thief and restore life as God intended. No matter how violent or subtle the enemy, Jesus cant be defeated. Take heart that He is fighting for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Ask Jesus to show you the ways he is fighting for your freedom this week.</p>
