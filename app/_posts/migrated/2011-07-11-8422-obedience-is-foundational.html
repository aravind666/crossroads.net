<p><strong>Week Two: Obedience</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, July 11<br></strong>Obedience is Foundational</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to make you the foundation of my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ<br></strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:21-27&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:21-27</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God  is not interested in how "churchy" we sound, or how many Bible verses  we have memorized. And He is not impressed by our good deeds-unless they  are done out of obedience to him. We can do seemingly great things,  like speak prophecies, cast out demons and perform miracles, but if  were motivated by anything other than Gods will, weve missed the  boat.</p>
<p>Jesus is not only warning the crowd against the danger of false  prophets, hes again highlighting the importance of obedience. He says  that following the will of the Father is</p>
<p>foundational  to knowing Jesus, foundational to the Kingdom. Obedience to God equals a  spiritual foundation that will withstand the tough times.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>So  the word of the day seems to be "foundation." On what is your  foundation built? What motivates how you move through your day? How do  you make decisions, big and small, about your life? As you go through  your day today, practice making your decisions based on what you think  God is saying you should do. Consider it "practicing obedience," or  strengthening your foundation.</p>
