<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we continue to look at the Beatitudes (Jesus first public words that are a series of blessings). Beatitude comes from a word that means happiness or joy. So view these as ways Jesus wants to help you understand joy in a new way.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We have looked at poverty of spirit, a need for God, which when we contemplate can lead us to mourning and humility. When we pause in our lives, we must admit that there is a sadness or pain in our souls that longs for God. We usually look for worldly comforts to quiet or cover that pain, but Jesus knows that the better course of action is to let that provoke a longing for God and his righteousness. If we place our longing there, and hunger and thirst for God, we will be filled. When we let God fill us, and we feel deeply his mercy toward us, we will have mercy to give. In Gods goodness, that opens up a flow of mercy in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend time in contemplation again today. Foster a hunger for God. What would it mean to let God quench your spiritual thirst? Or to experience an overflow of mercy?</p>
