<p><strong>Week 1: Everyday Worship</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, July 26</strong></p>
<p>Everyday Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Chronicles%2016:29-34%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Chronicles 16:29-34</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its summertime, and often folks find themselves out of the normal rhythms of their everyday life. So over the next few weeks, well be taking a look at how we can maintain an attitude of worship wherever we are, even if its at the beach. And if youre the kind of person who equates worship with acoustic guitars and breathy singing, well challenge that assumption.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, well dive deeper into the passage from 1 Chronicles. Whether youre on vacation or in your backyard, well see how worship can turn from an event to a lifestyle. In the song A King and a Kingdom by Derek Webb, theres the following line: Worship is a system, its not an event. Its every human you talk to, and every penny you spend.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout the next two weeks, well return to that refrain several times, asking ourselves whether thats the case in our own lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever thought of worship as one particular action or in one particular setting? Write down your own definition of worship, and save it over the next few weeks as we examine alternatives. (Youll look back at it, later.) Ask God to open your heart to new ways of worshipping him, and seeing him in the everyday.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
