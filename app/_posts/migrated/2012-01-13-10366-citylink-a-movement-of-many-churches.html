<p class="noPspace">Over the course of the coming weeks, well provide answers to many of the frequently asked questions about CityLink. Heres one we received at a recent update meeting:</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>What kind of commitments are other churches involved with CityLink making to the initiative?</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br class="pagebreak"></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">Since its beginnings in 2003, when it was co-founded with five other churches around the cityall representing different geographic, denominational, racial, and socio-economic backgroundsCityLink has been a movement of many, many churches, not just Crossroads. This summer, CityLink received pledges of volunteer support from 40 churches, as well as financial commitments from 20 of those churches.  There are two passages from the Bible that have influenced us on this. First, Luke 12:48 says, "To whom much has been given, much will be required." We know that Crossroadshas been enormously blessed as a church, so were committed to being a blessing on a large scale. Second, in Mark 12:43-44, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everythingall she had to live on."</p>
