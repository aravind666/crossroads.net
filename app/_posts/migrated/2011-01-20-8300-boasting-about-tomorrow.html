<p>Boasting about Tomorrow</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, bring me to a new understanding of how I find security in tomorrow instead of you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%204:13-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 4:13-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many of us have experienced how life can change in an instant. A single late-night telephone call or a downturn in stock prices can shatter our illusions of control and security. We learn the hard lesson that many of the things we have come to count on will not always be there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our supposed security, whether it lies in our relationships, our stock portfolio or even our talents, is a myth. They, like us, are mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. While this is a sobering reality, James doesnt tell us this to build fear; hes telling us the reality of our world and how boastful plans are fleeting. So long as we rely on the things that we can buy, plan or possess for security, we will never come to rest on the only foundation capable of bearing that weightthe foundation of God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you areas in your life that make claims of your trust other than him. Pray the dangerous prayer of asking God to increase your trust and faith in him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
