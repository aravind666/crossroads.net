<p>Being Number One</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, its easy to feel like I dont measure up. Its easy to feel like a failure. Remind me that, in Your eyes, I am enough.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012:%2041-44&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 12: 41-44</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>In our culture, to be number one is to be everything. Or as UCLA coach Red Sanders once said, winning isnt everything, its the only thing. Society tells us success looks like driving a certain car, or having a certain amount of money or friends on Facebook. Arriving at anything short of that imaginary number one is failure. (Sorry, number two. Sorry, number 6,431.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>All God wants from us is... us. He wants a relationship with us. He wants our obedience and our heart. While it seemed like very little to the world, the widows offering was astoundingly rich in the Kingdom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being number one is never defined as the biggest pay check or the nicest office. And its not defined as striving to join all the PTA committees or coach all the teams. Its defined by how close we are to Gods heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>P.S. Theres room for lots of number ones.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What have I sacrificed in my efforts to be number one? Was it worth the cost?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4</a></p>
