<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:28%20&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21:28</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God gives each one of us a job to do. He wants to send us out into the vineyard (the Kingdom) to tend to it and make it grow. Because we are heirs to the Kingdom, God wants to teach us the family business and have us invest in it. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of some ways you are currently investing or wanting to invest in the Kingdom. Write those down, then ask God how he sees you helping those grow.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
