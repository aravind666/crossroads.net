<p class="noPspace"><strong>Faith by James: Words are Power</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Ask God to open your eyes to something new today.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3%3A9-12&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">James 3:9-12</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A45&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Luke 6:45</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">James says our words not only direct our life, but demonstrate where our life already is---where our relationship with God is. When we spend time with Him and follow his words, what we say becomes a natural reflection of his character. Then our words are capable of changing not only our life, but others. Changing the course of a persons life? Thats a lot of power.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of a difficult person in your life. Instead of letting em have it, encourage them or bless them with your words. If you need some help, ask God for anything specific he wants to say.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 14</a></p>
