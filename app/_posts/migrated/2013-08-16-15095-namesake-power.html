<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Namesake: Power</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Is God an egotist? Lets continue to look at how God does things for his namesake.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20106:7-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 106:7-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God desires for us to be his promotion team--for us to give him credit, even when we are in hard times. The Israelites were in hard times in Egypt, like slavery. They did not trust God or give him their focus, even right before he made a way for them to exit slavery at the Red Sea. But God promoted himself with shows of power and authority--for his namesake.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">No matter what we do, God will show himself. Today, though, lets be His front line of promotion. Journal about a way that you could publically give God credit, then do it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 11</a> </p>
