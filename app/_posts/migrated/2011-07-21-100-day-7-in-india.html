<p class="noPspace">Hey folks,</p>

<p class="noPspace">So on yesterdays post I wrote about how  this day was going to be challenging. I had no idea when I wrote that,  how underwhelming the word challenging would seem today. We split up  in to 2 groups for our balwaldis visits. A balwadis is essentially a  daycare center for extremely poor families whose parents often leave  early in the morning and return late in the evening as they go out to  work (or to find work). Most children are left to fend for themselves  during the day, but some are taken in by the balwadis. Many of our new  pastor friends we interacted with this week, run a balwadis in their  neighborhood. They use their own personal funds, they give these  children (anywhere from 1 to 10 yrs of age) the chance of an education,  and like my close pastor friend told me today.......we give them hope.  My perception of India has completely changed in the last 3 years.  Ive come to love the Indian people, Ive come to see immense hope, dare  I say Ive come to love this city. But Ill be honest.....I initially  struggled to see hope in what we saw today.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We pulled  over on the side of the road, and walked back a muddy alley to the side  of a hill. Since its monsoon season the alley ways turn in to muddy,  sewage rivers and the smell is overwhelming. As we reached the hill, I  knew the 200 yard walk to the balwadis was going to be difficult. The  hill was cascading with sewage, the cows and dogs were all on the brink  of death, there was no reciprocation of smiles or waves to the people  like there normally are (and in all honesty, I dont blame them. We  obviously looked like tourists). When we got to the balwadis, we were  greeted by 50 young children in a 10 x 20 room. They were wearing new  uniforms that Crossroads had purchased for them. We also catered in  lunch for them. It was absolutely amazing to see the determination, and  Spirit led work of the pastor and his wife in conditions that they  voluntarily work in everyday. But it was tough. Many of the kids were  visibly sick, a couple were crying consistently....and it was a "im not  well and I need comfort" cry ....not a im a baby and I just like to cry cry.  Many of the kids had hacking coughs, and some had visible deformities  and skin conditions. We only stayed for a short time (8 adults, 50  children, and 4 teachers will fill up a 10 x 20 room pretty quickly) and  were not given the opportunity to really interact with the children.  But I prayed.....and I prayed alot. I prayed for the children and each  individual hand I held on the way out of the balwadis. I prayed for the  children peering in the windows of the balwadis to see the pale skin  visitors, I prayed for the parents who had to leave their children to go  to work for meager wages, I prayed for Pastor Anil and his wife who  live out the gospel everyday, and I even prayed for the dog on the side  of the trail with a litter of pups that couldnt have been more than a  couple hours old. A verse Ive had in my head today from all of this  was Psalm 72 12-14:</p>

<p class="noPspace">For he will deliver the needy  who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.  He will take pity  on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.  He will rescue  them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his  sight.</p>

<p class="noPspace">God wasnt going to let me leave without  seeing some sort of hope.......and as we left, I saw that glimmer. A  young girl (6 or 7) caught my eye as we entered. She had a maturity  about her that no 6 yr old girl should have to exude. She was taking  care of 2 of her siblings (probably 2 or 3 yrs old). She was helping  them sing, she was comforting them when they cried, and as we handed out  the lunches.......she made sure every other kid had their lunch before  she took her own. She took the very last lunch. 6 yrs old, forgotten  by this broken world, but not by Jesus. I cant wait for her to meet  Him.</p>

<p class="noPspace">The other group had a different, more uplifting  experience and we realized just how amazing these pastors are that we  are partnering up with. We wanted to go to the balwadis to see the  ministry fields of our new friends.....and Im so glad we did because it  will be an honor for our community at Crossroads to come along side  these folks as we move forward. I hope you all get a chance to meet  them one day.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Tonight is our last night here in India.  Tomorrow we will be checking out and heading to the Crossover offices  to debrief and partake in some delicious food and time with Keith,  Ramona, Jamie and Ajay. Ill have one more post when we get home and Ill add pics from the week at that time.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Farewell from India!</p>
