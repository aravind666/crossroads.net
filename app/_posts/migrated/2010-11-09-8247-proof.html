<p><strong>Tuesday, November 9 </strong><br>Proof <br><br><em>Take a moment and ask God to meet with you today. </em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2011:1-2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:1-2</a> <br><br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>We live in a world that demands proof of beneficial results before action. But faith is acting even when we dont know the certainty of the outcome. Are you acting in faith, or are you playing it safe?  <br><br><br><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>Tell God that you want to live in faith, not in fear. Ask Him to show you specific ways you can act in faith today or this week.</p>
