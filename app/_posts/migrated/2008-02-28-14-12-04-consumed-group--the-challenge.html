<html><body><p>(Caution: Spoilers Ahead)<br><br>The folks in my group are blessed not to have credit card debt. So, we delved straight into how we spend our time and money, and what really surprised us. For nearly everyone, TV was the big time waster. As a part-time working mom, I was happy to see that I actually spend twice as much time with my child as I do working, which in a way assuaged my occasional guilt on that subject. <br><br>Next, we spent a while discussing what challenge we would do. Rather than drawing out of a hat, we decided to reach a consensus. We agreed on level four, deciding that level five would be difficult with small children to feed.<br><br>Immediately the synergy began. One person said that they needed to buy a birthday gift for this weekend; two people offered up ideas that wouldn’t cost her money. She’s going to make coupons with another group member’s scrap booking materials, and the gift she’s giving is worth more than what she’d planned to buy. <br><br>As far as my  challenge goes, I’m on day two, and so far so good. I wish I’d bought sandwich bags at the store before the challenge began, so I’m trying to decide if they are groceries. I was going to get take-out tonight because my husband has a meeting, but we’ll just eat at home. Other than that, things are going smoothly, but it’s only day two, so I haven’t <em>needed</em> anything yet. <br><br>I decided to give up mindless internet surfing (Crossroads.net doesn’t count, of course). That’s not going as well, as I’ve already slipped into that trap a few times when I've received Facebook updates. <br><br>How are your challenges going? Are you wearing your black rubber band? Are you afraid of showing it off in public, for fear that people will know you’ve got a wad of cash? Write about your experiences <a href="">here</a> in the Forum.</p></body></html>
