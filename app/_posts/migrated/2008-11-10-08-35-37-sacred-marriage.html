<a href="/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/legacy/content/sacred-marriage.jpg" alt="Sacred Marriage" width="100" height="100" align="left"></a>This weekend Chuck Mingo referenced a book in his talk called <a href="/">Sacred Marriage</a>. The book poses the question, "<em>what if God designed marriage to make us holy rather than to make us happy?</em>"  For anyone wanting to better understand the dynamics of a healthy, Jesus-centered marriage or  how God uses our relationships to teach us about who he is and what he values, it's a great read.<br><br><strong>LINK TO AMAZON.COM: </strong><a href="/">Sacred Marriage</a>
