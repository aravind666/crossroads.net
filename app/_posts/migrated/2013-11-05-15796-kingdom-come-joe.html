<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Kingdom Come: Joe</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Read Joes story and see how he fought for his son.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>JOES STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">My son was heavily into drugs. Respect for anyone, anything and even himself ceased to exist. "Oh Lord," I prayed, "I am going to lose this boy, to either death or jail." I remember asking God to make his drug buddies disappear, to hide his money, to make him understand the dangers of a drug life. It seemed like God did not listen to me. The more I asked, the more I kept hearing, like a soft voice in the distance, "Be still, and know that I am God."</p>

<p class="noPspace">But I argued, pleaded and begged God. And yet I heard "Be still, and know that I am God." How I argued and cajoled and demanded answers and actions. Nope. "Be still, and know that I am God."</p>

<p class="noPspace">Then one night, my son called to say he was going to kill himself, that he had taken every drug he had and would not tell us where he was. I stood in the driveway and I shouted "GOD, PLEASE SAVE MY SON, DO NOT LET HIM DIE TONIGHT, KEEP HIM SAFE UNTIL MORNING!"</p>

<p class="noPspace">I remember thinking, "OK God. I will be still, I will trust in you. I will have faith that you alone are in charge of this and there is nothing, absolutely nothing I can do."</p>

<p class="noPspace">Finally, morning came. Several friends went out to search the neighborhood for him. And they found him---walking back from the convenient store. Safe. Alive. The ER room doctors said he took enough drugs to easily kill him. Yet he had no ill effects from the attempt. And, he stopped using. I know what saved him that night. Our King. My Dad taught me through that experience to trust him, to be still and know that he is God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The words Joe heard are found in <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001AbIcABxzdg1aPRmNDARyqK8sRcdTDRGc3mCouak9r5_t65F-jNGEEEOva-7rFXnUgVXt-AOjk--r5FZt_0LPB2jCY145RfC7ToM0FAsLHFGCgnSSuEq-7R3r6w4yeMSzwJjBSWu-iH6vi7CvxzOgPzyE-Q4eO9WYtiTwHrsBUQ4_23JRvaal48lZUB-2nhtruvHBDP3dS1-rwkIcXeUWKQ==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Psalm 46:10-11</a>. They challenged him to trust and obey his Dad. When he did, Joe was able to fight against his fear, fight for his son and experience the Kingdom.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Where might your Dad be asking you to "be still" and obey him? Think about it. Then, fill in the blank: "Dad, I trust you to _____________." Write this down. It might help you to see it throughout your day.</p>
