<p><strong>Friday, March 25</strong></p>
<p>State of the Union</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please give me a good ear for hearing your voice today as I read about your character.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:1-26&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah 40:1-26</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Weve all been inspired by finely-wrought speeches, gotten wrapped up in presidential promises, or felt motivated by the latest talk radio or Ted Talk. But no leader has ever said words as audacious and brilliant as what you just read in Isaiah 40. No leader has ever spoken that kind of galvanizing truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the God were invited to follow. This is the God who both gathers the lambs [us] in his arms and in the same breath, reduces the leaders of the world to nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Who to better lead us?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>From Isaiah 40:1-26 (or read throughout Isaiah), what characteristics of God are you longing to experience? Is it His force, his compassion, his creativity? Tell God what you want to know of him, and he will show you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 6</a></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>This week weve looked at several interactions God has with people in the Old Testament. In these, and in many other Old Testament passages, we see Gods incredible grace and love.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in the blank: Before this week, when I thought about how the God of the Old Testament is characterized, the word that comes to mind is _____ ? Where or who did this view come from?</li>
<li>Are there any ways that the passages weve read have changed your view of God in the Old Testament?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
