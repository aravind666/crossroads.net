<p class="noPspace"><strong>Priests: The Spirit</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Jesus left us an amazing gift, the Holy Spirit. Lets look at how God gives us the Spirit to make us priests.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">In Exodus 19, Moses is about to come down the mountain with the ten commandments (Mondays verse covered his journey up the mountain). In Acts 2, the Holy Spirit entered the world on what was already called the day of Pentecost. Many people were in Jerusalem to celebrate Pentecost, which was the day that they celebrated Moses giving the Law. When you read the two verses, can you feel some similarities? Maybe, God was trying to refresh their memories. Maybe, he was saying it was that priesthood time that he had talked about. Maybe, he wanted to let them know that he was making a new covenant with them, not through commandments, but through the Holy Spirit.</p>
