<p class="noPspace">When studying the miracle of Jesus feeding the crowd today, notice the leftovers.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Jesus gave thanks for the food, then distributed it. And after everyone had eaten their fill, twelve bountiful goody bags remained (one for each disciple). The disciples were always intended to be Jesus distribution system--for sharing the good news, and in this case, for sharing and collecting the food. Its a beautiful thing to see Jesus caring not only for the crowd, but for his closest followers as well.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>If you consider yourself a Christ-follower, think about one way that God has provided for you (maybe in an unexpected way, like in this weeks story). Spend a moment thanking God for that provision.</p>
