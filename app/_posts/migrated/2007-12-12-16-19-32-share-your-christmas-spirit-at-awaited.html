If you love Christmas and can&rsquo;t get enough of cocoa, carolers, cookies and, uh, cars, consider serving at <em>Awaited</em>. We need volunteers in all areas, from working the photo booth to directing traffic to making hot chocolate. Shifts are available for all eight shows from Dec. 19-24. If you&rsquo;d like to help (and we do need your help), please <a href="mailto:christmasvolunteers@crossroads.net" title="Email Christmas Volunteers">email christmasvolunteers@crossroads.net</a>.
