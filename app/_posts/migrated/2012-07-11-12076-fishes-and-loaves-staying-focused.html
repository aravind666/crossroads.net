<p class="noPspace"><strong>Fishes and Loaves: Staying Focused</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">When Jesus feeds the crowd with a few fishes and loaves, Jesus focuses his God-given authority on serving, not gaining human status.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001BaDLTqUkMKsqKVzciIFEXG3C2iyYurI-KYC6h3rthlG2WgYQ0b9DhUMXvhFhSNjrgUBDol49AeSBIBuHRykOOzBopTYAxK9JdpnSzW6mlnoRnZjsoGY7kl0qgJgedJZrvsepgashhycTPtJCjX2xV3AzWJC_JCjb_PvvgLwr_15T6eDCwMkc9F4Z723R28fLmXgPS_yjZXhIPyxS0xsPDg==" target="_blank">John 6:14-15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Instead of understanding that Jesus has come to provide in a new way, the crowd wants to make him their worldly king. Jesus stays focused on his mission, resisting the temptation of worldly power and retreating to spend time with his heavenly Father.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Today, consider a place in your life where your efforts to gain worldly power might be getting in the way of your focus on God. Sneak away at some point today (even if its a bathroom break) and spend a moment praying for focus and against distraction.</p>
