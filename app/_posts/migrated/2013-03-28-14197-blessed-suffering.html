<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When Jesus began his teaching with these public blessings, it would have been immediately clear that this man was blessing like one who spoke for God. He revealed that he was not just man, but God. He blessed an unexpected bunch, as the Israelite higher ups had formed a false belief that things like poverty were a sign that you were cursed by God. Jesus makes clear here how false that teaching is as he blesses. Meanwhile, this ending on persecution is Jesus prophecy of his own death. He came to be persecuted, and following Christ means following him into persecution, but we can be confident that God blesses that, and even as he resurrected Christ, he redeems our suffering.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
