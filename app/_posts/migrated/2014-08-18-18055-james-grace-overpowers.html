<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Grace Overpowers</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were learning what James has to teach us about humility.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 4:6-7</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">But he [God] gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble and oppressed. Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday, we considered James challenge to be fully loyal to God. In todays passage, James reminds us of the potency of Gods grace. When we humbly ask, He generously provides grace that overpowers the pull of the world. In other words, Gods not waiting for us to become self-control superheroes. Hes poised to give us all the power we need.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Talk to God about why you need him. If it helps, write it down.</p>
