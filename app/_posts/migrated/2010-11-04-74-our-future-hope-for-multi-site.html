<html><body><p class="noPspace">No matter where and what God calls us to, we believe  our  primary call will always be to everyday, average Cincinnatians who are  wrestling with whether theres a God, and if so, if he has any relevance  in their lives. Until every person in Cincinnati has seen their lives  transformed by  Jesus, were not done. Not done growing. Not done sacrificing. Not done  living out the mission God called 11 people to, 14 years ago. And  whether  we number 10,000 or 100,000, well continue to  connect seekers with growing Christ followers who are changing the  world. Its who we are, and who were called to be.</p></body></html>
