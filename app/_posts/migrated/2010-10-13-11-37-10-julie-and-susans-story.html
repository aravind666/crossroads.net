<p class="noPspace">Julie* is a part-time  working mom with five children.  For many years, she has worked  diligently as a home health aide to support her family.  This year,  thanks to a mentoring relationship like the ones CityLink will offer,  Julie and her family purchased their first home in Westwood! Here is her story:</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Julie’s  employment and housing situation are relatively stable, but she and her  family face many of the same challenges that are common among families  who have been in generational poverty. Financially, Julie’s salary  coupled with the survivor benefits she received after losing her husband  are not sufficient to meet all of her family’s needs. And, while she’d  like to work more, Julie’s son has special needs that require extra  time and attention.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">There are numerous resource gaps that  have limited Julie and her family. Firstly, she lacks a support network.  When one of her children gets sick at school, she has no one to call for  last-minute childcare. Secondly, bus transportation is not provided for  her children’s school. Both of these resource gaps affect Julie’s ability to work. as much as she’d like. In addition, Julie has a learning disability, making reading and  writing a challenge for her.  She’s doing her best to advocate for her  family, particularly her son with special needs, but she is not always  aware of the resources available to assist her.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Enter Julie’s mentor,  Susan, who is helping to bridge these resource gaps by guiding Julie and  connecting her with services that can help her family, such as a  first-time home-buyer’s grant from <a href="">Smart Money</a>, and educational  services to help Julie overcome her learning disability. Susan also has  helped Julie with completing applications, finding a supportive church  community and making financial decisions, including her home purchase.  And, most importantly, Susan is part of a growing support network on  which Julie can rely in times of need.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Julie is one of the many faces of  generational poverty; a woman who is motivated to care for her family,  but who lacks access to resources that will move her out of generational  poverty. But with her mentor Susan walking  alongside her, Julie purchased a home and is working on her nursing degree.</p>
