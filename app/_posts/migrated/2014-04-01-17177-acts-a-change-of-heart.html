<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: A Change of Heart</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next few weeks, The Daily will follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to soften your heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9%3A1-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 9:1-18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If there is one guy who shocks us the most in the Bible, its Saul. He wasnt just saying nasty things about Jesus followers---he was hunting them down, arresting them and killing them. Thats a pretty hard thing to bounce back from. But God had a different plan. He changed Sauls heart and redeemed his story. Like Saul, no matter what it is were struggling with or how hard our hearts might be, God can change us and use us to change the world.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Saul was imperfect like you and me, but God used him to change the world. What is something about yourself you dont believe you can change? Trust that God will help you make the first step.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 9</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>EAT CHEAPLY, CHANGE THE WORLD</strong></p>
