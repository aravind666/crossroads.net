<p><strong>Week One: Lessons from Joshua</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, August 1</strong></p>
<p>Warriors</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, teach me how to be a warrior for your Kingdom.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Moses  is the general, Joshua is the field commander. To fight the battle,  Moses spells out a simple strategy - "you fight, Ill pray." Joshua  didnt question or doubt. He did exactly what he was told - fighting the  battle with the sword, trusting that Moses was handling his end. And  the battle was won.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For  the next two weeks, well be looking at the life of Joshua, a warrior  and leader in the Old Testament. Today, we can see that no matter how  strong we are, were not meant to face our battles alone. We need a  Moses praying for us as we fight. And likewise, we can be the Moses for  others as they face their own challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  and write about a battle you are currently facing. Do you have "a Moses  on the hilltop" praying for you? If so, call that person today with  gratitude and encouragement. If not, ask God to bring to mind someone  whocouldpray for you as you fight. Call that person, and ask them to  pray for you.</p>
