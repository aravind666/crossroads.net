If you teach in any setting here at Crossroads (Kids Club,
CSM, Community Groups, etc.) you&rsquo;re invited to learn, practice and
sharpen your skills. There will be two, three-hour sessions, and you
must be able to attend both. The first will be a skills workshop, and
at the second, you&rsquo;ll teach and receive feedback in small groups. Two
dates are available&#58; <strong>Wednesdays, August 12 and 19 (6-9pm) or Saturdays, September 12 and 19 (9am-noon).</strong> All workshops take place at Crossroads Oakley. Space is limited;<a href=\"../mysend/131\" title=\"CG email\"> sign up</a> by August 5.
