<html><body><p>I came across an <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/working-with-your-spouse-finacially/478/">interesting post </a>on a productivity blog this morning about how married couples can better stay aligned in their finances. Communication is a critical part of success in marriage, but when it comes to $$ it seems that more and more couples I encounter prefer to "keep things separate", with separate accounts, credit cards, etc. Instead of coming to an agreement about financial decisions, it seems that many are opting for a "you do your thing, I'll do mine" ethic. This can breed distrust, secrecy and "cracks" in communication. <br><br>My wife and I dealt with this for quite a while in our marriage. We met and married in our late twenties and the process of "becoming one" financially seemed too overwhelming to deal with. We both had jobs, accounts, baggage, etc., and to combine it didn't seem worth the effort. Once we did so (a few years into our marriage), however, we noticed that our communication was better and that we were more aligned in our financial priorities. It's tough to have financial "secrets" when everything is out in the open.<br><br>So...how are you and your spouse handling finances? Are you combining them, or are you keeping them separate? How is either working for you? Feel free to sound off in the comments.</p></body></html>
