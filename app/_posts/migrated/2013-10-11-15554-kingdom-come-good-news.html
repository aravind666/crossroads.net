<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The word redemption in the original greek is apolytrosis which is actually made up of two greek words: one which means to release or to free, the other which means by way of payment or ransom. We are born onto a planet that can feel quite frequently like the domain of darkness with no way out. The good news (quite literally) is through Jesus we have been delivered from that domain and enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
