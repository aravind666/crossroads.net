<p>During the Free  journey, The Daily will be short and sweet. We'll start the week with a  heads up about your Free guide or small group, and spend the next few  days revisiting important ideas from the weekend message. <br><br>Since  you already set aside some time right now to do The Daily, why not shift  your attention to that bright orange, freedom-filled guide? This week  we'll explore the ways the belief you've identified has played out in  your life, and what God has to say to us about the ways we might be held  hostage. Remember: work all the way through Week Two in the guide  before your next group meeting.<br><br>If you don't have a small group  yet, hope is not lost. Open groups are meeting onsite in Oakley, Mason  and Anderson on Wednesday nights at 7pm.
