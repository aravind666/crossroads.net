<p>On Tuesday night, Haiti was hit with a catastrophic earthquake that rippled through the capital city of Port-Au-Prince and the hillsides of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>We've finalized plans to support relief and rebuilding efforts there with a $120,000 contribution to the <a title="Restavek Foundation" href="http://www.restavekfreedom.org/" target="_blank">Restavek Foundation</a>. Founders Jean-Robert Cadet and Ray &amp; Joan Conn are part of our community, and we believe strongly that we should support them in the way they say it's currently needed most.</p>
<p>We're extending ourselves with this unplanned expense to help with this important work. If you want to go above and beyond in your <a title="Serve" href="/my/serve/index.php">serving</a> or <a title="Give to Crossroads" href="/my/give/giveToCrossroads.php">giving to Crossroads</a>, your generosity enables us to react in community in times of need.</p>
<p>Here are some specific prayer requests from Joan Conn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pray for health and strength in the days to come</li>
<li>Pray for our team members that we have not yet heard from</li>
<li>Pray for our children and that God will lead us to them</li>
<li>Pray that God will direct us and give us wisdom</li>
<li>Pray for a place to stay and headquarter efforts (we have no idea what that looks like at this point)</li>
<li>Pray that God will help us find Valerie, Gaelle and Dina, and that they are safe (these are three young girls that have very special places in our hearts)</li>
<li>Please pray that we do not have rain for a few days, as that would be devastating</li>
<li>Pray for peace and that violence will not erupt</li>
<li>Pray for all of Haiti: there is no water, no electricity, no food and no medical supplies, primarily in Port-Au-Prince</li>
</ul>
