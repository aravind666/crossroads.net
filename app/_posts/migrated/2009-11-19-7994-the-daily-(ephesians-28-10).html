<br>Welcome to The Daily. <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><br><strong>Thursday, November 19<br></strong>Rescued by Grace Alone<br><strong><br></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Helvetica">Take
a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.<br></span></em><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 2:8-10<br>(Yes, you probably read these verses yesterday. Read them again, slowly.) <br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>It is by grace you have been saved... This is a tough one for some of us to accept. We live in a transactional culture where were used to getting only what we give, and receiving only what weve paid for or earned. The idea of God freeing us from the prison of sin and shame out of mercy and grace is not one that sits well with many of us. Some people spend their entire lives trying to earn God's favor, or repay him for something that's already been freely given.<br><br>    Where in your life are you trying to earn something God wants to give you freely?<br>    Do you ever feel like God is generally disappointed with you? Why?<br>    Consider the love and acceptance from God that Paul describes. How can you live your life today in a way that reflects that grace?<br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask God to keep you from an I've got to earn it attitude. Thank Him for what he has done for you through Jesus and ask him to help you receive his gifts freely, as they were intended.<br> </body></html>
