<p>A Social Outcast</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see where you can take action and experience the miraculous.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%205:21-43&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 5:21-43</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This woman was bleeding for 12 years, nonstop. Thats an incredibly long time to suffer, especially when it meant that you were forbidden to be out in public. So she knew she was taking a risk just leaving her home, and that if anyone recognized her she could get into serious trouble. She was taking an even bigger chance touching Jesus. He was a big deal. But she knew He could heal her, and so she touched him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, after 12 long years, it was over. She was healed. It would have been easier and safer for her to sit by and hope Jesus would happen to stop by her house. But this woman wasnt passive by any stretch. She acted boldly and reached out for Him, and in her action she experienced the miraculous.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do you need to be healed but are ashamed of asking, or feel like youre not worth it? Ask boldly for God to heal you of your suffering, no matter what form it has taken.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%2011:22-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 11:22-25</a></p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Weve spent this week looking at people who threw themselves into the miraculous. And what happened? They got to experience things of which others only dream. Not because they were special or perfect, but because they were willing to act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever felt like God was calling you to be part of something amazing? How did you respond?</li>
<li>Hopefully, weve been growing closer in relationship to Jesus because were hearing stories about people who take action and then experience him more fully. What miraculous stories, from your life or others lives, could you share with others?</li>
</ul>
