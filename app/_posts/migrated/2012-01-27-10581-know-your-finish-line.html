<p class="noPspace"><strong>Know Your Finish Line</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week were asking God to show us how our money can serve us.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>God, help me to focus on You during this time. Keep my mind free from distractions.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:57-62&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">Luke 9:57-62</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>We all have different temptations when it comes to money. But just like the people speaking to Jesus in todays passage, the bottom line is always the same: theres something standing between us and God. If you havent already done this, spend a few minutes thinking about your biggest issue regarding money, and how it has kept you from letting God fully embrace you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Our challenge has been to focus on God anytime we think about money this week. Close out this week thanking God for his generosity, and asking for the strength to continue moving him toward the center of your life: </p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>God, thank you for your generous love and all the ways you provide for me. Please help me stay focused on You, and give me the strength and wisdom to use money as a tool for growing closer to you. Amen.</em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
