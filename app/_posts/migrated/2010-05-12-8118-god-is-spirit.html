<p>God is Spirit</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study His nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The term spirit often conjures up all kinds of images of ghosts flying around like Casper or phony apparitions. We get hung up on floating sheets or dismiss the idea altogether, struggling to picture anything else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God the Spirit is different. It is more than just a force or an essence. It is the very presence of God in and around us.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you find the most confusing about God as Spirit?</li>
<li>How do you feel about the idea of having the presence of God with you always?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Find a quiet place away from the noise and be quiet (really quiet) for 60 seconds. Quietly ask God to help you be sensitive to his spirits presence. Sit and listen.</p>
