<p><strong>Friday, May 13 </strong><br>The Spirit of Patience</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to keep your mind and heart open to his teaching.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2012:9-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:9-19</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When we mess something up (big or small), we desire others, especially God, to be patient with us. We want to be shown some grace, to be given the benefit of the doubt. But do we do the same for the people who offend us? Do we ask the Spirit to fill us with his patience and grace?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patience is a two-way street, and God clearly demands reciprocity. He expects us to pay it forward: to pass his patience and grace onto others. Yet, this doesnt just affect the recipient. When you release anger, annoyance, impatience and judgment--the Spirit does its freedom work in you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Is there an area in your life where you would describe your current state as "long-suffering?" Ask God to help you experience joy through your patience.</p>
