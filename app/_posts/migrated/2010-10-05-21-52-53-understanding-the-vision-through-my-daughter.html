<p class="noPspace">Last week, we took my 16-month daughter to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital to have a cyst removed from around  one of her eyes. It was a precautionary procedure to prevent the cyst  from causing any future issues to her eye nerve. As a first-time  parent, this was an extremely scary experience seeing our daughter go  under anesthesia for the first time. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Fortunately, everything went as  smoothly as possible, and Lydia was back to her playful self, acting like  nothing even happened only a couple days later (including diving off the  couch to her daddy).  As my wife and I were sitting at home thinking about how thankful we  were for the amazing care at Children’s, what hit me the most  after this experience was the thought that there are thousands of kids  in South Africa (too many that I’ve played with) who could never  receive a needed surgery like this...in fact, I’ve met too many kids  that don’t have the basic necessities of nutrition and hygiene, much  less health care. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">This observation has always prompted questions like "How can  things be this way?" and "What went wrong with God’s plan?" or "How  could He let things like this happen?" However, I think those are the  wrong questions to be asking. Instead, I want to challenge myself and  others to ask, "What am I doing about it? How am I being a part of  God’s plan?"</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Do I believe that poverty will be eradicated in South Africa  overnight? No. Will everyone suddenty receive best-in-class healthcare? Probably not.  But I do believe that God can use a community  like ours to start a literal revolution in South Africa, and hopefully  give everyone involved an opportunity to be stretched and grow in new  ways in the process. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">This is a huge and crazy task to take on,  changing the face of medical care in some of the worst conditions. But  the stakes are high in a region that is rampant with poverty and HIV,  and that is why I couldn’t be more excited to see how God is going to  work through this campaign to make the impossible happen in the years to  come.</p>
