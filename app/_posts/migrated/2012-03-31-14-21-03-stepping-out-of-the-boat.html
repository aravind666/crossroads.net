<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>“God doesn’t just rely on preachers and pastors to bring change to this world; he uses people in  every domain of society with the skills and conviction needed to advance the Great Commission.” </strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong> Rev. Bob Roberts Jr.</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In Amy L. Sherman’s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Calling-Vocational-Stewardship-Common/dp/0830838090">Kingdom Calling: Vocational Stewardship for the Common Good</a>, she notes that safe shelter, wholeness, justice and beauty are being aggressively and successfully pursued in several churches (like Crossroads) and groups throughout the world.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">This pursuit is not only happening through the efforts of church leaders, however—but through the vocational talents of lawyers, social workers, medical doctors, designers, researchers and many others who make up the Church and have the heart and passion for seeking justice in their communities and around the world. Over the next few weeks, we’d like to share the stories of two such justice-seekers, Crossroaders Jamie Elkins (featured in the book) and Shannon Constable.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jamie’s Story</strong></span></p>
<p class="noPspace">A 2006 political science graduate from Miami University (Ohio), Jamie began her career as a paralegal with an immigration law firm. In 2008, she unknowingly began her justice journey when she first learned about the trafficking of women and children in South Asia. “My heart ached for them,” says Jamie. “I knew I had to do something.” She started following the efforts of International Justice Mission (IJM) to rescue girls and women from forced prostitution and advocate for them in legal cases against their perpetrators. She also learned that this type of slavery wasn’t limited to South Asia, but had a firm grip in her home city of Cincinnati. She was moved to action. Jamie worked as a volunteer researcher in the development of the <a href="http://freedomcenter.org/freedom-forum/index.php/2009/07/study-human-trafficking-cincinnati/">Cincinnati Human Trafficking Report</a>, interviewing first responders to trafficking reports in the community, assessing their knowledge about the subject and their standard response to such reports.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In February 2009, she traveled to India with a group from Crossroads to visit an IJM-partner aftercare home for survivors of trafficking. Upon returning to the U.S., she could more clearly see the gift of freedom she had been given, and the importance of ensuring a better life for the young girls and women she had met in India. Less than a year later, she accepted a position as an intern with IJM’s field office in Mumbai, raising awareness among church leaders about the injustice happening in their own backyard, and how the members of the community could play a part in changing the game. Following her internship with IJM, Jamie joined <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Crossover-Foundation/225284324181742">Crossover Foundation</a>—utilizing her skills in administration and relationship-building to partner with local churches and social enterprise organizations in the restoration, renewal and reinstatement of trafficking survivors. “Even though I didn’t physically rescue women from situations of forced prostitution, provide them with counseling or train them for rewarding careers, I am glad and extremely blessed that I was able to use my skills in administration to ensure that my colleagues and our partners were well positioned to do their jobs well, directly impacting the livelihood of the girls and young women we worked to restore.”</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Jamie has since returned to the U.S. and is serving on staff at Crossroads, coordinating GO trips to India and mobilizing volunteers on the Justice Team. The perspective she brought back to share with us is one of encouragement and passion. “Sometimes the problem seems too large to tackle—and it is if you think you can tackle it alone,” Jamie says. “The good news is: we all have gifts, talents, skills and hearts. When each person does what they can to fight this terrible injustice, action happens and lives are changed.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">“If you’re open to his call for you … just listen, be open to new things and step out of your comfort zone.”Jamie adds, “He’s going to show you that he’s there every step of the way. He’s not going to let you go out into an area of the world or into an issue without any guidance or without a flashlight. He might not shine the light very far, but he will shine it to the next step. And that’s what he did for me.”</p>
