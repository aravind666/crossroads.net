<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Grain</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next next four weeks well be looking at Gods love of the new: new territory, making us new, and today, new grain.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2023:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Leviticus 23:16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So, why new grain? This was an offering made during the Jewish feast of the weeks, but why couldnt they just bring whatever they had--like an old canned good to support the food pantry? When it comes to making an offering to God, he doesnt want our old and worn-out leftovers. God deserves our newest, our freshest, our first. Whatever is new to us captures our heart a little bit more, and the truth is--God wants our heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do you have new ideas that have been brewing in your mind lately? Write them down. This doesnt mean that you are committing to them--dont commit to do anything. Offer them up to God and see what he has to say in response.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2015&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 15</a></p>
