<p>Vanity Plates</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, show me where Im accepting names that dont reflect the truth you say about me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:26-28&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 1:26-28</a>; <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:4-5&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 1:4-5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Can you imagine getting a name like Mother of the Living? If you had been Eve, wouldnt you have expected something a little more like the scarlet letter pinned to your fig leaf? Some name that reflected things youd done, the problems youd eventually cause, the stuff you did when you were eighteen?</p>
<p></p>
<p>We all have names we respond to. Some weve earned, some came early and havent lifted, some just fell into our lap. But we often treat those names (and live up to those names) as our identity. Maybe we look up when we hear Alcoholic, Unemployed, Absent Father, Mid-Life Crisis, That Guy, Troubled Teen. Even good names, like the title of our job or where were at in life can leave a heavy mark that blocks out the names were given by God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What names does God have for you? You can start the list with My Child.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What names do you get called by others? Make a list of the good, the bad, the ugly. Consider titles, your day-time gig, nicknames...sure, even your vanity plate or screen name. As you look through your list, which names dont reflect the love and grace God has for you? What names are missing?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
