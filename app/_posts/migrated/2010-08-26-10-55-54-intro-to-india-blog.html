<p class="normal noPspace">Hi, and thanks for checking out the India blog. Whether it’s a story of a volunteer’s experience interacting with a girl rescued from slavery in Mumbai, India, or an update about where our vision of creating aftercare homes is headed, you’ll find it here.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">We’ll use this blog to start conversations about what God is doing in India and in your own life. Look out for posts that enable you to respond with your own experiences and react to stories from others in our community.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Subscribe or check back to this blog for stories, photos, video and more. We hope you’ll follow and participate in the discussion about the fight for freedom across the globe.</p>
