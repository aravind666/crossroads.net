<p>The Spirit of Joy<br><em><br>Spend a minute asking God to keep your mind and heart open to his teaching.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%208:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:15</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Joy and fear cannot cohabitate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Bible tells us, "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love" (1 John 4:18). We cant experience true joy when were looking over our shoulders, expecting God to cause pain or make us feel worthless. Gods love for us is perfect, with no "punishments" attached, no threat of disownment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Resting in the truth of completely belonging to God will douse stress, anxiety and fear. And it makes room for us to experience the Spirits joy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Is there any part of your life where you used to have fear or stress and are now joyful? Take a minute and celebrate that.</p>
