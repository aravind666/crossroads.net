Are you interested in spending time with God
on a daily basis? We make it easy for you with The Daily, a tool that
enables
you to engage with the Bible and prayer regularly. Able to be completed
in just 15 minutes, each day follows a simple format of reading,
reflection and response. You can <a href=\"http&#58;//www.crossroads.net/my/grow/theDailySignup.php\" title=\"Subscribe to The Daily\">subscribe
