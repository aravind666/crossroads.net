<p>Filled with Fullness</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to ask God to speak to you during this time.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Ephesians%203:14-21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 3:14-21</a></p>
<p><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Paul, the writer of this prayer, is asking God to root and establish his followers in love. When this happens, we will be "filled to the measure of all the fullness of God." God wants you to experience his fullness. One way to receive more is simply to ask God to root you deeper in his love.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What images come to mind when you consider the phrase: filled to the measure of all the fullness of God? Ask God to guide your thoughts as you do this.</p>
