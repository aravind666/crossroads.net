<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:1-3&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 39:1-3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants you to believe that he is with you at work. Joseph knew that God was with him and that God had him succeed in everything he did. God wants to take the load off of your back and make things feel easy. Once you release these things, people will notice there is something different in the way you work.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Focus today to do everything with the full belief that God wants to make you succeed.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
