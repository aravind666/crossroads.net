<p class="noPspace">God has provided, so what now for our work in South Africa?  Now WE RUN  after those lost in the outskirts of Mamelodi, getting them the basic  medical care that they need and that we take for granted.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">To  reach this big vision, however, we have to be smart. Medical services  delivered in the wrong way can actually hurt people. That is why we’ve  spent more than a year working with our partners in South Africa to put  the necessary infrastructure in place to facilitate the resources that  are now coming available, and we’ve agreed on a rollout plan that will  allow us to aggressively yet intelligently attack the problem.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In early 2011, our first act will be to work with our partners at  Charity &amp; Faith to identify a target community within Mamelodi. This will be a  community of around 10,000 people where we can focus our efforts for the  next couple of years and where the first satellite clinic site  will be built.  This is where we will deploy home-based care workers, and this is where our teams traveling from the U.S. will spend most of  their time, building relationships with the people of the target  community. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Our hope is that by focusing on one area of Mamelodi, we can  show success in improving the quality of health care and quality of  life for the people living there. And that win is what will attract more  resources and more partners allowing us to expand further.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">From a medical services standpoint, our first act will be to get the  dental clinic in the hospice building at Charity &amp; Faith running  fulltime with a South African dentist seeing patients every day.  We  will then turn our attention to providing fulltime eyecare and glasses  manufacturing in partnership with <a title="OneSight website" href="/">Luxottica/OneSigh</a>t, and to deploying a  test class of home-based care workers.  Eventually we will open a  fulltime primary care clinic and pharmacy, hopefully with the ability to  provide life-saving anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV/AIDS  patients.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">And, in early 2011 we will be ready to launch all of the coming  trips to South Africa. There will be six opportunities to travel to  Mamelodi in 2011 and more than a dozen in 2012.  We will need medical  professionals from all specialties to travel to SA to power the new  system.  We will also need non-medical people to man the decks—  assisting doctors, checking-in patients, playing with kids, setting up  chairs, handling crowd control and doing about a thousand other jobs  that are necessary to make our medical clinics work. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">If you are  interested in going to Mamelodi (or perhaps your doctor or dentist is  interested?), keep an eye out in January for all of the info.  It’s going to take time and a lot of focused effort to get to where  we believe God has called us in South Africa, but with the great  sacrifice showed by the Crossroads community during Game Change, we now  have the resources to make it happen.</p>
