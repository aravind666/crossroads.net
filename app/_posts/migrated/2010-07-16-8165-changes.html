<p>Changes</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to focus on God as your Father.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Corinthians%201:26-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 1:26-31</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many people see the first half of the Lords Prayer as asking God to go about his business, off somewhere else, through someone else. But the way God goes about his business is through us. Through you. Were not praying to some distant God doing distant things. We are praying that our Fathers love, kingdom and will would be known in us and through us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The religious elite rejected the followers of Jesus as not good enough. His disciples were petty, self-centered and concerned with personal power and position. But God still chose them. They were ordinary, imperfect and unprepared, but God knew their potential and promise. He knew he could work through them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the transformative potential of this prayer: that God affects change in us. And the missional potential of this prayer: that God affects change through us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to bring his kingdom and will to you and to affect his changes through you. If any specific ideas or promptings come to mind, jot them down.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>

<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We spent some time this week taking a look at the Lords Prayer in a different way.</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific way or ways has God revealed himself to you this week?</li>
<li>How does praying through the first part of the Lords Prayer feel now?</li>
<li>What changes--significant or minor, literal or mental--have happened for you this week?</li>
</ul>
