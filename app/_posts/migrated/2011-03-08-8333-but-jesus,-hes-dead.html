<p>But Jesus, Hes Dead.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me believe in you as a Father who does the impossible.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway John 11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011&amp;version=NIV">John 11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So Jesus friend gets sick, and he takes his time getting there. As a result, he misses the hospital goodbye, the funeral, the post-funeral mealthe whole shebang.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If youre Lazarus family in this situation, and you know Jesus is the only one who can save him, imagine how you feel when he shows up four days after the death. Imagine the shattered expectations and how forgotten or angry youd feel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Jesus comes, and when he calls a dead man out from the grave, hes doing more than a resurrection of one mans life. Everyone around sees that He is a revolutionary, not limited by our expectations, not limited by doctors predictions or historical evidence or human understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This moment is so powerful that Jesus enemies said, If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Jesus said to Martha, Didnt I tell you that you would see Gods glory if you believe? The word glory means weight. Jesus is inviting Mary to experience the full weight of God being with us. That question was not just to her, but to all of us. Take a few minutes and ask God to help you see his glory in your life today.</p>
