<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Turn Off the Noise</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, weve explored how God speaks to each of us. Today, were going to listen for Him in a quiet place.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for focus and to protect you from distraction in a quiet place.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14%3A22-23&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 14:22-23</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1%3A35-37&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Mark 1:35-37</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its pretty clear that if we want our lives to look like Jesus, we have to spend some time alone. Before Jesus went to work and when the day was done, he spent time with God in a quiet place to pray and talk with him. Sometimes, turning off all of the noise and distractions around us means we can give God more space to be the loudest voice we hear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Turn off all of the noise around you---the radio in the car, your iPod at the gym, and the TV after dinner. Go silent and listen for what God might be saying to you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 3</a></p>
