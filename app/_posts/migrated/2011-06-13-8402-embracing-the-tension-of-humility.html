<p>Embracing the tension of humility</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%205:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 5:1-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It might seem surprising that Solomon, a king with all the power granted royalty in biblical times, would write these passages about humility in word and deed. But the fact that he discusses humility drives home the points we covered last week about Gods plan being large and complex beyond our comprehension. Losing a sense of humility, much like failing to embrace the other tensions surrounding friendship, work and patience, can make us lose track of our unique place in Gods bigger plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its a very human act to think of ourselves as superior: to lesser creatures, or even to other humans. But this passage reminds us that there is a much, much greater power at work in our lives, and that by staying humble, keeping our egos in check and listening, we may learn more about the plan God has put in place for our lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>The tension of humility isnt as straightforward as other tensions mentioned in Ecclesiastes. Consider situations where its tempting or advantageous to be proud, vocal or opinionated. Can you come up with ways you might handle such situations while still showing the humility Solomon recommends in todays reading?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 10</a></p>
