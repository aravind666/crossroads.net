<p>The Journey</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>During the Free journey, well start the week with a heads up about your Free guide or small group, and spend the next few days revisiting important ideas from the weekend message.</em><em> </em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yesterday started the Prayer Experience at Crossroads in Oakley (March 21-29). Its a tactile, audio-guided experience that you walk through at your own pace. If youve never done anything like this before, dont worry. Its a non-threatening, quiet and safe place to spend time with God.</p>
<p></p>
