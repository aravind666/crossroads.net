<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we are going to scan out and see the fuller picture of the spiritual battle that surrounds us. Well focus today and tomorrow on battle prep which is in the first two sentences of this verse.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">READ</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:6-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 5:6-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you can picture William Wallace in Braveheart, or a hundred other epic movie battle scenes, there is always a leader giving a final <span id="shorten_0" title="pump-you-up-battle-cry-inspiring-leadership">pump-you-up-inspiring-leadership</span>speech. God is unexpected. His battle cry doesnt inflate us with false promises. In fact, He deflates. Get low, is Gods pump up speech. If you will be humble and get low, you will be ready to let God do what He does best.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We talked last week about Gods holiness, knowing he is holy and we are not, is the best way to engage every daily battle we have. Ask God to show you one area of your life that he wants to inhabit more fully with his holinessand where you need to get out of the way.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2018&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">Matthew 18</a></p>
