<p><strong>Week 1: The Good God of the Old Testament</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, March 21</strong></p>
<p>The Good God of the Old Testament</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, fill my heart and mind today with your abundant love and grace.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:17&amp;version=NIV">James 1:17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Some of us have a tendency to imagine a killer God of the Old Testamenta god who says that if we do what he wants, well be okay; if we dont, hell make our lives miserable. But a view like this short-circuits our understanding of a God who isand who he always has beenthe source of knock-down, amazing love and grace. So well spend two weeks (with a special week in-between) reading and considering parts of the Old Testament and finding these layers of Gods character that we might sometimes overlook (or relegate to the New Testament).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of the last book you read, fiction or non-fiction. Now consider the main character. If the book is even remotely well-written, that character has complexities. You dont know everything about that character on page 1 or even 99. And Gods depth blows that characters depth out to the water. Spend a minute asking God to help you break free from any boxes youve put around him.</p>
