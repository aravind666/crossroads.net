<p class="noPspace">Greetings from Mumbai!</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">I want to preface any and all blog posts by saying there might quite possibly be grammatical errors and sometimes incoherent sentence structure.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to have some grace as those of us posting to this blog are posting at night after hours of out and about-edness.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">With that said,&nbsp; today was our &rsquo;get adjusted&rsquo; day in India.&nbsp; It started with a delicious breakfast at the hotel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m telling you, India has some of the best food in the world.&nbsp; Specifically the fruit.....amazing.&nbsp; We then headed out to get a feel for the city, and that takes on a whole different meaning during monsoon season.&nbsp; The rain literally comes out of nowhere.......and it comes down hard!&nbsp; We toured Calaba and the surrounding area (Taj Hotel and Gateway to India).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great way to get a feel for the city and not push ourselves too hard (jetlag defintely sets in during the second day).&nbsp; We also learned that if you&rsquo;d like to get attention in this city, walk around with a 1 yr old pale skin baby in a backpack (my wife and I brought our son with us).&nbsp; We had what felt like the Indian paparazzi trailing us and there must have been 50 pictures taken of that little fella!</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We grabbed lunch while we were out, then made the 2 hour trek back to the hotel (2 hrs = 15 miles).&nbsp; Once we got back to the hotel we huddled up with Keith, Ramona and Jamie to go over our agenda for the week.&nbsp; We will be running a Kids Camp tomorrow with about 50 kids, Monday and Tuesday include a pastors&rsquo; retreat with some folks who we are praying we&rsquo;ll be able to partner with moving in to the future.&nbsp; Wednesday includes visits to two aftercare homes, and Thursday we&rsquo;ll be heading to some daycare center&rsquo;s in the more poverty stricken parts of town. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">There has been alot of preparation for these days and we know God&rsquo;s going to show up in some amazing ways to grow the relationships we&rsquo;ll be forming during our time here.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">All trip participants are doing great, and we loved getting to know each other better and exploring today.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Until tomorrow.......</p>
