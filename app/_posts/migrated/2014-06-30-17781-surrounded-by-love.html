<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Surrounded by Love</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were redefining the words happiness, wealth, family and love. All this week were going to receive Gods love for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for his creation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A28-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 1:28-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We only have to look around to see how much God loves us. Every tree in the park, every cloud in the sky shows us His love. Then, after he created it all, God gave it to us. Why? Because he loves us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This video from <a href="http://crossroadskidsclub.net/">Kids Club</a> tells the story of how God created the world---just for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend some time today in Gods creation. Maybe that looks like lunch in the park, a run around the block, or ice cream in the backyard. Take note of the details and care God took in creating it for you.</p>
