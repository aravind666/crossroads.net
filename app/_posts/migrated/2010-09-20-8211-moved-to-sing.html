<p>Moved to sing</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to show you something new about how he works.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%2016:22-26&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 16:22-26</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Have you heard the one about the guy who sang his way out of prison?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Huddie Ledbetter, a blues singer better known as Leadbelly, was pardoned and released from prison in 1925 after writing a song of appeal to the state governor of Texas. Thats bold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paul and his friend Silas demonstrated similar boldness when, instead of wallowing in prison, they decided to sing to God instead. Locked in the most secure part of the prison, their only crime was teaching others about Jesus. Yet, they were moved not to doubt God, but to sing to him. Around midnight, while they were singing their guts out, God shook the prison and broke their chains.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Where in your life do you feel imprisoned? Are you trying to work out your own freedom apart from God? What if God simply wants you to worship and wait instead?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Chronicles%2020:18-22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Chronicles 20:18-22</a>. God has a history of using singing to bring about freedom. How does this story affect your view of worship through music?</p>
