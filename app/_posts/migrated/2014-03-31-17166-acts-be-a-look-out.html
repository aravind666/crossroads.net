<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next few weeks, The Daily will follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for clarity and clear direction.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A29-38&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 8:29-38</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The church grew because people like Philip talked about Jesus. He was also a good listener and kept a look out for what the Holy Spirit wanted him to do. When he heard the man reading Isaiah out loud (not unusual for the time), he knew that was a guy he needed to talk to. So he went to him and before he knew it, he was telling a complete stranger about Jesus and baptizing him. It might seem a bit unreal, but thats really how the church grew.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Be on the look out for things on the horizon that could help you grow the church in your family, at work or even on the weekend. What can you do to get dirty and help the church reach more people?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 8</a></p>
