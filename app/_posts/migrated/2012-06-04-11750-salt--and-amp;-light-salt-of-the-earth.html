<p class="noPspace"><strong>Salt &amp; Light: Salt of the Earth</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were unpacking Jesus descriptions of his followers as salt and light.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>"<strong>You are the salt of the earth</strong>.But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Matthew 5:13-16<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001Gex0vtz0uaJ33uCjOcHJHUgdH_-9OsOpVdVlg3mTy6LaozzzV6eK-o77rd62hkJGG30IkwgOkITWWmvHw4Vi0An2nXq8XgQqGoJ4qkezEOtCb4TkVLB_ah7mqU-1mzFDRLr0_WoWYqXQnh0FBfUzJ4pSGhJ5d5t_UD2c4mf2JxH65zectt189A==" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Salt is both a preservative and a flavor-enhancer. In other words, salt keeps food fresh and makes it more interesting. So what does it mean for Christ-followers to be the "salt of the earth?"</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>If you ever talk to others about Jesus, how do you think you come across? Apologetic, meek, argumentative, arrogant? Ask God to show you what a fresh and interesting relationship with him looks like--and then youll be able to share the good news about him in a salty way.</p>
