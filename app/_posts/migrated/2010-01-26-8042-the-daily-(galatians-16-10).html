<p><strong>Tuesday, January 26</strong><br>You Cant Please Everyone<br><br><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Galatians 1:6-10<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>We are hard-wired to need approval. Our confidence, self-worth, and ability to thrive are directly connected to the level of approval we feel. The problem is that while approval from others feels good, its never enough. But its often the type we seek. <br><br>Experiencing complete, life-giving approval only comes from knowing that Jesus chose to live and die for us. <br><br>Paul understood this distinction. In Galatians 1:9-10, he says that Gods good news for the world only comes through Jesus, and anyone who teaches otherwise should be punished. His words were just as shocking and unpopular then as they would be today. Clearly, the only approval Paul was concerned with was coming from God.<br><br>We might not always win the approval of others (following Jesus can lead to choices and actions that are unpopular), but if we want freedom, God is the source.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there anything that God is asking you to do right now, but youre hesitating because other people may not understand or approve?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>For the areas in your life where you seek approval from someone other than Jesus, ask him to fill those places with his love and approval.<br><br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Philippians 3:1-11</p>
