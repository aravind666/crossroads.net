<p class="noPspace">Hey Cincinnati,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We just wanted to let you know that we happily received &amp; unloaded the first of two Thanksgiving Food Drive containers here in Mamelodi, SA. &nbsp;It feels pretty awesome to see them loaded in Cincy AND unloaded in SA. &nbsp;We were soakin up the Cincinnati love today as we cheered when the container arrived, jumped into the sweaty line of volunteers to unload it &amp; read the handwritten notes on the boxes. &nbsp;My favorite simply said, "To: Mamelodi, &nbsp;From: Your Good Friends in Cincinnati". &nbsp;So true. So rest assured, your liquid love arrived. &nbsp;</p>
