<p>Everyday Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%204:6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 4:6-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAKE ACTION</strong></p>
<p>This week, well be deviating a bit from the normal Daily routine. Well be putting worship into practice, right away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As shown in the passage above, we are called to worship God alone. Anything we put above Him is an idol. Starting now, and as you go about your day (all parts of it), ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>What (or who) am I doing this for, and why am I doing it?</p>
<p>Where am I trying to find comfort, energy or entertainment?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Keep a running list of your responses and consider if youre relying on these things or people more than God (i.e. worshipping them). Once youve compiled a list of potential idols, find someplace where youre alone and begin to walk through the list with God. Ask him about your iPhone, your TV, your workout routine. Are any of them receiving the worship He deserves? Invite the Holy Spirit to lead you in this, and listen. Turn the TV off and talk to God? Great. Let your iPhone go dead (gasp!). Do it. Take the time youd typically spend with the things on this list, and ask God to turn your heart towards worshipping him in that space today.</p>
