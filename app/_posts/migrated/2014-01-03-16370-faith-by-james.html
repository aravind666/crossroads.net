<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Over the next few weeks, The Daily will look at the book of James. Written by Jesus earthly brother, James perspective on following Jesus was action-based and when we "put our money where our mouth is" we can transform our lives and our world.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">James was one of the early leaders of the Church. He knew it was easy to get lost in all of the talking about following Jesus and forget about the doing. He also understood that to obey and follow Gods commands actually brings us freedom.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether someone taught you or you just picked it up somewhere along the way, its easy to think that our works get us closer to God. But its not true. We already have His love and approval and when we receive that, our actions begin to reflect it.</p>
