<p class="noPspace"><strong>Nehemiah: Plans and Conflicts</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">As we go through the Game Changers series on the weekend, The Daily will study people from the Bible that changed the game. This week, were looking at the story of Nehemiah.

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think about your interactions today. Do you find yourself behaving like Nehemiah and his friends, or like the scoffers who opposed them? Are you willing to trust God and dig into the hard work ahead of you, or do you find it easier to criticize others efforts? Spend a minute asking God to see your interactions through his eyes.</p>
