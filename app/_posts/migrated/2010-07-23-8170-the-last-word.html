<p>The Last Word</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Pray through the Lords Prayer.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Nehemiah%205:13&amp;interface=print">Nehemiah 5:13</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Nehemiah%208:6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">8:6</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Turn to the very last word in the Bible. What does it say?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is one of those words that is used so much that it can lose its meaning. Its a word that is generally an expression of agreement, confirmation and ratification. Its like signing your name on the dotted line. And its binding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amen is not just a word we say; its a decision we make. Yes, Im a part of that, or Yes, I want that. Jesus is called the Amen in Revelation because he is the fulfillment of the binding contract that God has with us. And amen is used in the Old Testament when all the people agreed to do what was asked of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you say amen to the Lords Prayer and everything that it encompasses?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If you feel or have felt that the Spirit has asked for your amen, can you give it?</p>
<p></p>

<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We spent some time over the last two weeks taking a close look at the Lords Prayer.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you pray through the Lords Prayer, what stands out to you the most, and why?</li>
<li>How do you feel about this prayer being about change in you and through you? What changes have you been thinking about? Share one or two with someone, even if those changes seem like slight adjustments.</li>
</ul>
