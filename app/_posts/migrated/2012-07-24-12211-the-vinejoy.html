<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:11-15&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">John 15:11-15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace">REFLECTJesus is the first man to walk on the planet who is fully connected with God: His will, and His way of living. He has experienced that this way of living means experiencing love to its fullest--not romantic-comedy love, or pick-up-at-a-bar love, but real, authentic love. With Jesus living this way, walking and functioning in love, what has it led to? Joy. Complete joy. Joy that isnt fleeting, but has taken root and grown up.</p>

<p class="noPspace">RESPONDThink of a moment when you felt just a little glimmer of this kind of joy. Ask God to water that today.</p>
