<p><strong>Thursday, June 17 </strong><br> Be Bold</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes talking to God about whats been going on in your daily life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%2010:1-5&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 10:1-5</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If a life of following Jesus, being led by the Holy Spirit, and trusting God to the point of fearlessness isnt adventure enough, the Bible also spells out the power that comes from the authority we have in Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While much of the world believes bombs and blockades provide strength, we know the weapons we have at our disposal have the power to demolish demonic strongholds and knock down the plans the enemy has here on earth. Notice that Pauls boldness in these encounters from 2 Corinthians comes from being confident that he belongs to Jesus (verse 7). Pursuing a life of adventure in Jesus will take boldness. Thankfully, that boldness isnt the result of our own ability. It comes straight from Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are you confident you belong to Jesus? If so, have you ever considered the authority and power you possess as a Christ-follower filled with the Holy Spirit? Does it make you scared or excited when you consider the weapons at your disposal?</p>
