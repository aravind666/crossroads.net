<p class="noPspace"><strong>Work Culture: Eternity</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Are you a multi-tasker? Today, try these two tasks: work diligently and keep your focus on the things that last.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">There is nothing wrong with enjoying the fruits of hard work, but if our eyes are only set on things, theres a better place to focus. Most of those things end up in the toilet or city dump. So, come up with a better rhythm than just consuming. Work hard. Take time to enjoy the fruit. Thank God for the fruit. Focus on eternity.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Ask God to give you one word to focus on today. Maybe its diligence, kindness, patience or joy. Place it somewhere in your workplace that will remind you to focus on eternal things.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a job that has a culture shaped by God.</li>
<li>What could you do to bring more of that God culture to your current work?</li>
<li>Hold each other accountable: did you contact anyone this week to train you? How did it go?</li>
</ul>
