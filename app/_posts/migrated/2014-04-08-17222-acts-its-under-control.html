<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Its Under Control</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to follow the book of Acts and how we can apply its lessons to our own lives. And check out a Beans and Rice Week video each day to help you make the most of your meals.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to take you under his control.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A25-31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 16:25-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Sometimes it can feel like everything is out of our control. Thats when we notice something is wrong and has to change. For the jailer, those uncontrollable pieces were a massive earthquake and the risk that all of the prisoners would escape. For us, it could be a failing grade, a lost job or a struggle in a relationship. But ask yourself the jailers question, what must I do to be saved? The answer is still the same: believe in Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether youre trying to control something or it seems out of control, tell Jesus about it. Tell him why you want to control it or why it feels like you cant. Trust that Hes got it. Its under control.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
