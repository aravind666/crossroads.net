<p><strong>Week 1: James and the Beginners Guide to Following Jesus</strong></p>
<p><br><strong>Monday, January 10</strong> <br>James</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, open my mind to fully believing your desire to be part of my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%201:5-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 1:5-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>For the next two weeks well be diving into the book of Jamesa letter that reads like a beginners guide for early followers of Jesusbut applies to all of our lives, no matter where were at in our relationship with Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this specific section of James, were told that Gods wisdom is an abundant and available gift to us. This communicates much more than the fact that God is wise; it says, He loves to help. And this phrase can act as a universal response for Gods character. If youve lost your job and dont know how to handle the next step: Pray to the Father. He loves to help. If youre marriage is struggling: Pray to the Father. He loves to help. If youre dealing with a bad diagnosis: Pray to the Father. He loves to help. God might not answer us in the way wed expect or plan on our own, but he does answer in all his wisdom, and he does love to help.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Whats one area in your life where, like James readers, you dont know what you are doing? Ask God to replace your plans, insecurities or fears with his perfect wisdom.</p>
