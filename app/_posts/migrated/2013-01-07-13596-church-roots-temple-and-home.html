<p class="noPspace"><strong>Church Roots: Temple and Home</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue looking at the beginning of the Church as described in Acts 2. Today, lets put our focus on what was being described in verse 46.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001eSYV7oo33aeAjqcasP5j7YsRFrMGrCxfH26pZqEDkm3PvY-X9_8U8p2f-xW6ygz6Yb6QWINihdowbL2SPaiaBPFVHwj2vDdRKy8rthBk_26yvHN7EdGaW-TZVL-B9vbMprBDr1VyVR67HZZ54P5E7B0BpkRmNizVUnX3pbgIW9iZwy0tgBwxjwyXRSqjFlx19JMvlD1f1OsaBoqaxsetCg==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">There is a beautiful combination here. Throughout the history of the faith, there have been many folks who have gotten fed up with church buildings and tried to accomplish living out their faith alone or in smaller groups in homes. There are folks who show up every weekend to church, but never integrate their faith into their holistic life. It is clear that since the beginning of Christianity, there was both. There was temple and there was home. Wherever you slant: chip on your shoulder toward organized faith, or totally dependant on it, God has more for you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Ask God where He wants to lead you today. Does He want you to open your heart toward the temple experience, or open your personal life up?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
