<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+18%3A9-16&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 18:9-16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul led a lot of people to believe in Jesus. But it never would have happened if he hadnt spoken up. This isnt to say that Paul was a loud-mouth, but speaking in front of so many people can be an overwhelming task especially when not everyone likes what youre saying. Until God spoke to him, encouraging him to speak and not to be afraid. God took care of him and his voice.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Speak up and be bold. That doesnt mean say whatevers on your mind, but if youre holding back because of fear or something that doesnt feel like God, ask him to intercede and give you a voice.</p>
