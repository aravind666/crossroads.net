<p><strong>Week 3: A Fathers Gift</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, December 20</strong></p>
<p>For All of Us</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%202:1-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 2:1-12</a></p>
<p><br><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The wise men (magi) who visited Jesus after his birth werent Jewish, nor were they friends or neighbors of Mary and Joseph. Yet, God called them to worship Jesus as a sign that the existence of this child was for all peopleJews and Gentiles alike. (In fact, Gentiles would worship Him before many Jews.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The wise mens gifts to Jesus reflect the immense value of his birth, life and death. Do you receive this birth as a treasured gift? Are you excited for all to share in it?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>The wise men were only a part of the divine birth announcement that included the angels, the shepherds and a holy man named Simeon. Ask God for help more deeply treasuring the gift of Jesus. Pray for someone who is far from God to share in it with you today.</p>
