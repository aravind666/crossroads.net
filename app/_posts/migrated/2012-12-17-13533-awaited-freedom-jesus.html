<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong>In the Old Testament (the first section of the Bible), there were very specific rules about how to purify yourself before approaching a holy and perfect God. There werepriests, called Levites, who would sacrifice animals on behalf of people to atone for their sins.Jesus is foretold in the verse from Jeremiah as the one who will take over the job of the Levites. Jesus brought a freedom that had never existed before: the freedom to interact with a holy God, not through a sacrificing priest, but through Jesus who made the sacrifice for all time.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Look back over your journal entry from yesterday, and the list of places you need to feel freedom. Offer those to God, through Jesus. Put pen to paper and journal what you think God might be saying to you about these areas of non-freedom.</p>
