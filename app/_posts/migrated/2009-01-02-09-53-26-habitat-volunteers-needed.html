<strong>We&rsquo;re short on volunteers for the Habitat house Crossroads is sponsoring right here in Cincinnati, and we need your help to get a special family into their home in January.</strong><br /><br />We&rsquo;re building a Habitat home in Northside (4222 Kirby Avenue, 45223) with Crossroads volunteers dedicated to making a difference in Cincinnati. Our partner family, Austino &amp; Kama, are African immigrants who fled civil war in Liberia to come to the US. They have one son and have adopted another. We've been working on this home since the summer and are finally down to the final stages&#58; insulation, drywall and painting. We will be serving every Saturday in January, and we need your help. Please <a href=\"../mysend/35\" title=\"Email Habitat\">send us an email</a> to get the ball rolling.
