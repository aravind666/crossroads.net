<p>A Promise Fulfilled</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and tell God you want to trust in his promises.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:1-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:1-13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>A fierce wind and tongues of fire? When God sent us the Holy Spirit, he certainly made it worth the anticipation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the Holy Spirit, God kept his promise to the early church. And He keeps his promises now. They dont always involve flames, fierce winds or speaking in foreign languages, but his promises are fulfilled today, just as they were then. Throughout the Bible, we see that God is as good as his word.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If youre dealing with doubt about God fulfilling his promises, write it down. Then, ask God to remove that doubt from your life. If youre not struggling with doubt, write down promises God has kept. Then, take a moment to thank Him.</p>
