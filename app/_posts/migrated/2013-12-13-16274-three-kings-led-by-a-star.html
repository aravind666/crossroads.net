<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Magi were mystified by the stars. They studied their patterns and knew well the ancient texts. Men of great learning were often very rich, held in high esteem and treated like kings. In search of answers, God led these men on a journey using a star. A star they believed was the sign of the new King.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Their journey from the east was not easy. Desert, mountains and sea stood in their way. Still, the Magi followed the star. When they arrived in Jerusalem, Herod, King of Judea, had questions of his own. With his own authority in question, he asked the wise travelers where the new king could be found. Herod had plans of his own for this new ruler.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Still, the Magi travelled on in search of the greatest king they would ever meet.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants to lead you. Think of something you try to control. Today, let God take care of it. Spend some time with your Dad and give up control.</p>
