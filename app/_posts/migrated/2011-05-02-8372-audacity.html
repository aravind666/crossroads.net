<p><strong>Week Two: Prayer</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, May 2</strong></p>
<p>Audacity</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Jesus, help me to hear what you say about prayer, and then help me actually do it.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:5-8&amp;version=NIV">Luke 11:5-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Audacity. Other versions of the Bible use words like importunity, persistence, boldness, shamelessness, and brazen insistence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God loves it when we are bold, decisive, action-oriented. And Jesus says thats one of the keys to prayer. Prayer works best when we dont hedge our bets, but boldly ask. Banging on someones door at night isnt something that will be missed. Its shameless and audacious. But it works. Do we have the nerve to ask God for what we really long for? God loves showing off the amazing things hes capable of, and bold prayers let him do just that.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think about your life. What prayer have you been holding back? What prayer seems too big, too generous, too dangerous? Spend the next few minutes making those audacious requests of God.</p>
