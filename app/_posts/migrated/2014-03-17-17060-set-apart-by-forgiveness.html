<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Set Apart by Forgiveness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you something new about forgiveness.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+2%3A1-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Mark 2:1-12</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 18:21-22</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus did a lot of things while he was here walking and talking with us. He gave sight to the blind, words to the mute, and bread to the hungry. But one of the most important things Jesus did while he was here was model forgiveness---oh, and he forgave all of our sins. (Whoa.) If grace is what set Jesus apart, then forgiveness really tipped the scale.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus says to say youre sorry---again and again, over and over. Today, think of someone to apologize to, someone to forgive. Give them a note, send a text or meet up for an actual conversation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 1</a></p>
