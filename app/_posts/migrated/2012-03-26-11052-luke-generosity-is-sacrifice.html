<p class="noPspace"><strong>Luke: Generosity is Sacrifice</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were studying the book of Luke and taking a look at Jesus, the ultimate game changer. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1109618164624&amp;s=0&amp;e=001HXOdyqjf-9mfQXgQvskh_0Xd8diMy70jDr9cR8u89fAmkhW64zU4lrwr0J3_imwjmhh38GzVpro42HxMLvZ6GHIeFuk59CkzBtlnNiHqmTeL17YKy6AiJPFC0g_ZRhbuLg-K1SCrq5CzKGF4cjWQ18TWNooGuM2TKIZkgJttRFX4C-eYdYiqHHro4wt1KLq_204NgowGwiNAGhZIh0XYig==" target="_blank">Luke 7:36-50</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Take the account you just read about and turn it into your dinner party. From your life, who is the woman? Who is the criticizer? Assign those roles, think about the ramifications, and youll more fully grasp Jesus as a game changer.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</p>
<ul>
<li>This week was filled with stories of Jesus generosity. Using one story (i.e. man healed of leprosy, dinner with outcasts) talk about how Jesus action required a sacrifice.</li>
<li>Luke (from whose book weve been studying) was a doctor who thoroughly investigated the eyewitness accounts of Jesus life and ministry. He focused a lot on Jesus compassion for the weak and suffering. If you were recording Jesus life and ministry, what aspects would you focus on? (In other words, what draws you to Jesus?)</li>
<li>Whats one way you could reflect Jesus generosity this week?</li>
</ul>
