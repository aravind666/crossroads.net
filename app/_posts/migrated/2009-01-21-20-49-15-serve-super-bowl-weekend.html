services and about twice as many people as a normal weekend, we need
your help to make everyone feel welcome and have fun during Super Bowl Weekend <strong>Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. </strong><a href="../../getInvolved/superbowl.htm">Sign up</a> to serve now; it's not too late. (There are six services, SAT: 4:30p, 6:15p, 8p, SUN: 8:30a, 10:15a, 12p, so there is still plenty of time to tailgate before or after you serve.)
