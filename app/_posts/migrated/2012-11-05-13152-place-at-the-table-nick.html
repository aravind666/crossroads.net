<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET NICK</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"God as a father is teaching me a lot about what it means to be a man. Looking at my life, I suppose I could say that I have a "manly resume," but I really dont live like a man. I live like a man according to what the world has taught me: ambition, pride, "strength" (which is really just covering weakness), striving for superiority, arrogance, and a desire to be "right" all the time.</p>

<p class="noPspace">God is showing me, as my Father, that his sons delight in peace. His sons desire joy, are filled with compassion, walk in humility, and show his love to the world. Yes, a godly man works hard and is responsible; but not for vainglorious ambition or self worth. Godly men fight for the sake of the well being of others (and not even with our own power, but Gods).</p>

<p class="noPspace">Its like when my earthly father taught me to ride a bike. He ran alongside me until I could pedal on my own. When I looked back, and he was waving, watching (as proud as an earthly father can be) as his son rode on his own. When I turned back toward the road; I hit a rock and lost control of the bike. God, as a Father, doesnt do that when his sons are learning to walk as men. As I move through this journey, when I feel like Im pedaling as hard as I can, and I am about to fall; I look back. And there is my Father, holding me steady, reminding me that he will never let go, that he loves me, and that I am truly his son."</p>
