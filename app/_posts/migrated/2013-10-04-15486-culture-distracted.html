<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>#Culture: Distracted</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue looking at the story of Mary and Martha this week and how they responded to Jesus visiting their house.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:38-42&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:38-42</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Can you imagine Jesus being at your house and telling him what to do? Martha is the definition of distracted here. She doesnt ask Jesus to teach and train her, shes too busy telling Jesus what his job is. Martha values doing the right thing over relationship--even her relationship with Jesus. Jesus becomes an end to a means for her.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have you taken Jesus and simply tacked him onto your very busy life or have you made him your whole focus? Journal about that today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 16</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20thessalonians%202&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print"></a></p>
