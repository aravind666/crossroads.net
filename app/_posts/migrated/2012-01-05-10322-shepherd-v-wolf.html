<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Picture God as a shepherd. Imagine what he would be wearing, what he would be holding in his hands, what kind of landscape he would be standing upon. Reflect on this single image for a minute. Then bring yourself into the picture. Walk up to the shepherd. Talk to Him, ask something, or listen to him work. (If it feels awkward, just give it a minute. Visual prayer is a great way to connect with God in new ways.) </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">For the next four weeks of the Daily, well be considering how money is a great resource--but also an insidious force that can deeply interfere with our relationship with God.</p>

<p class="noPspace">As it says in Luke 16:13, its impossible for us to serve both God and money. So we have to choose--and choose often. The good news is that even though money can be like the big bad wolf thats out to get us, God knows all of the wolfs tricks and is ready (and able) to help us put that character in his place.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">As a child, what were you taught about money? Think of how people around you handled it, how you saw people save or splurge, and what you took away from that.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
