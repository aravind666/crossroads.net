<p class="normal noPspace">If this world worked the way it should, what would it look like? If people loved God and their neighbors more than themselves, how would things be different? From time to time we get glimpses of this kind of life as the Kingdom of God shows up in our own ordinary lives. But we live in a broken world where people are sometimes selfish and where the strong often dominate the weak, taking the fruit of their labor, and even their lives. This is what the Bible calls injustice and oppression. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">I was a narcotics prosecutor for a number of years and I thought I had seen the worst of violent oppression in the cases I handled. But that was before I went to work in Calcutta, India with <a title="International Justice Mission" href="http://www.ijm.org">International Justice Mission, </a>leading a project to combat sex trafficking of children. During my tenure I saw hundreds of women and children held as slaves by pimps who controlled, deceived and terrorized their victims into submission. </span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">As I walked through the jammed lanes of red light districts, I could see the dead stare of hopelessness and resignation on their faces. Some we were able to rescue, some not. </span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">In the Bible the ancient and wise King Solomon struggled to believe in and follow God because, as he said, I looked and I saw the tears of the oppressed. Their oppressors have power. And there is no one to comfort them. </span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">In an odd way I love Solomons question, because it is so real and so honest. Sovereign God, why should I believe in you if the oppressed are made to suffer in this world you have created? The Bible does not shrink back from the hard questions. It not only asks them honestly and without qualification, it also answers them with equal and sometimes terrifying force. You can also find Gods response to the question of violent injustice, and that his plan is for his own people to respond to violence with courage and to do justice. </span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal"><br></span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">God told ancient Israel through the prophet Isaiah: "[L]earn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow." (Isaiah 1:17)</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">God intends us to be his primary response to violent oppression. Jesus shows up when we show up in his name. So it becomes possible for me, and for the children relieved from the suffering of the brothel, to believe that God is both good and strong. And our showing up tellsall who are watchingthat this dark world will not be broken forever. The Kingdom is coming. Jesus is making all things new. </span></p>
