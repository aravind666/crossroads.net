<p class="noPspace">In case youre wondering about the food we sent to South Africa as part of our Thanksgiving Food Drive, know that our friends at both the <a href="http://www.topsy.org.za/">Topsy Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.gbcsoweto.org.za/">Grace Bible Church</a> are using the food to support less-resourced organizations in their communities so those organizations can be a blessing to those they servejust like Crossroads does with the food here in Cincinnati. Below is a photo of food boxes being distributed at a day care center.</p>
