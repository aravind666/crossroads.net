<p class="noPspace">Greetings from Mumbai!</p>

<p class="noPspace">I want to preface any and all blog posts by saying there might quite possibly be grammatical errors and sometimes incoherent sentence structure. Youll have to have some grace as those of us posting to this blog are posting at night after hours of out and about-edness.</p>

<p class="noPspace">With that said, today was our get adjusted day in India. It started with a delicious breakfast at the hotel. Im telling you, India has some of the best food in the world. Specifically the fruit.....amazing. We then headed out to get a feel for the city, and that takes on a whole different meaning during monsoon season. The rain literally comes out of nowhere.......and it comes down hard! We toured Calaba and the surrounding area (Taj Hotel and Gateway to India). Its a great way to get a feel for the city and not push ourselves too hard (jetlag defintely sets in during the second day). We also learned that if youd like to get attention in this city, walk around with a 1 yr old pale skin baby in a backpack (my wife and I brought our son with us). We had what felt like the Indian paparazzi trailing us and there must have been 50 pictures taken of that little fella!</p>

<p class="noPspace">We grabbed lunch while we were out, then made the 2 hour trek back to the hotel (2 hrs = 15 miles). Once we got back to the hotel we huddled up with Keith, Ramona and Jamie to go over our agenda for the week. We will be running a Kids Camp tomorrow with about 50 kids, Monday and Tuesday include a pastors retreat with some folks who we are praying well be able to partner with moving in to the future. Wednesday includes visits to two aftercare homes, and Thursday well be heading to some daycare centers in the more poverty stricken parts of town. </p>

<p class="noPspace">There has been alot of preparation for these days and we know Gods going to show up in some amazing ways to grow the relationships well be forming during our time here.</p>

<p class="noPspace">All trip participants are doing great, and we loved getting to know each other better and exploring today.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Until tomorrow.......</p>
