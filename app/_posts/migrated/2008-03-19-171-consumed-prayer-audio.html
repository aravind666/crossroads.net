<html><body><p>For those who weren't able to grab a take-home version of the Consumed Prayer Experience, <a href="/music/2008-03-19-11-24-04-consumed-prayer-audio.html">here's a link</a> to download it as an mp3. It's a greatly condensed version of the audio from the experience designed to facilitate a twenty-minute time with God whenever you'd like. Enjoy!</p></body></html>
