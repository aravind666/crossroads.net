<p class="noPspace">From the time that Smita Singh started Mahima in April 2010, she wanted to do more. Mahima, the first Christian aftercare home in Kolkata, serves as a beacon of hope for girls under 18 who have been rescued from a life of trafficking. But what happens to them after they turn 18? While the girls receive life-skills training at Mahima, they aren’t yet prepared for reintegration into society.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">In early 2011, as Mahima’s director of aftercare and counseling, Smita met with representatives from both the People’s Church in Toronto and Crossroads. She shared her vision of a “transition home” for young women over 18 to help build on the Mahima home foundation. Smita said, “Crossroads came alongside Mahima when the need was strongest.”</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Through Smita’s guidance, Crossroads’ financial support and the prayers of many, her vision became a reality in July with the rental of a small house. The building was big enough to host four young women (who had transitioned from the Mahima home) and one social worker. The goal: to help heal, educate and prepare these young women for a job and self-sufficiency. Through daily routines of private morning tutoring, “off campus” classes at a local school, individual counseling, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral group therapy, and participation in a certified, six-month tailoring course at a sewing machine manufacturer, these young women are fostering friendships, building self-esteem and preparing themselves for reintegration back into society. Two of the women have received their tailoring certificates and have already begun internships, creating unique fabric bags and home décor items at a social enterprise called Destiny Reflections, which will eventually lead to full-time employment.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Outside of the essential education and trade-based training, these young women are being transformed inside as well. Smita shared a story about an occasion when they took all of the Mahima girls to a “mela” or fair. A new girl who was only 10 years old joined them. This young girl had a history of violent outbursts when in a crowd, and this time was no different. When Smita asked a housemother to take her home, four girls jumped in and volunteered to return to help take care of the younger girl—sacrificing their evening of fun to look out for her needs. Smita reflected, “I was so proud that they have learned how to prioritize and look after the well being of another person before their own pleasure. God has been so merciful and I pray that he blesses these four girls so much.”</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">And bless them He has. On November 29, the young women moved into a beautiful two-story house that will serve as their new transition home. Equipped with sewing machines and a training area so they can bring their internship work home, the house has more than double the capacity—allowing space for six more women to eventually take residence. One of the young women, Shefali (pseudonym), gives this account through translation:<em> “I really like it here. We have been given a big house, and both the upstairs and downstairs are very nice. Don uncle has sent us money for this, so many thanks to him.... I am enjoying my studies. I am also going out to work part time. In a few months we will be able to go for work alone and that makes me happy.”</em></p>
