<p class=\"noPspace\">From the time that Smita Singh started Mahima in April 2010, she wanted to do more. Mahima, the first Christian aftercare home in Kolkata, serves as a beacon of hope for girls under 18 who have been rescued from a life of trafficking. But what happens to them after they turn 18? While the girls receive life-skills training at Mahima, they aren&rsquo;t yet prepared for reintegration into society.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">In early 2011, as Mahima&rsquo;s director of aftercare and counseling, Smita met with representatives from both the People&rsquo;s Church in Toronto and Crossroads. She shared her vision of a &ldquo;transition home&rdquo; for young women over 18 to help build on the Mahima home foundation. Smita said, &ldquo;Crossroads came alongside Mahima when the need was strongest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Through Smita&rsquo;s guidance, Crossroads&rsquo; financial support and the prayers of many, her vision became a reality in July with the rental of a small house. The building was big enough to host four young women (who had transitioned from the Mahima home) and one social worker. The goal&#58; to help heal, educate and prepare these young women for a job and self-sufficiency. Through daily routines of private morning tutoring, &ldquo;off campus&rdquo; classes at a local school, individual counseling, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral group therapy, and participation in a certified, six-month tailoring course at a sewing machine manufacturer, these young women are fostering friendships, building self-esteem and preparing themselves for reintegration back into society. Two of the women have received their tailoring certificates and have already begun internships, creating unique fabric bags and home d&eacute;cor items at a social enterprise called Destiny Reflections, which will eventually lead to full-time employment.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Outside of the essential education and trade-based training, these young women are being transformed inside as well. Smita shared a story about an occasion when they took all of the Mahima girls to a &ldquo;mela&rdquo; or fair. A new girl who was only 10 years old joined them. This young girl had a history of violent outbursts when in a crowd, and this time was no different. When Smita asked a housemother to take her home, four girls jumped in and volunteered to return to help take care of the younger girl&mdash;sacrificing their evening of fun to look out for her needs. Smita reflected, &ldquo;I was so proud that they have learned how to prioritize and look after the well being of another person before their own pleasure. God has been so merciful and I pray that he blesses these four girls so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">And bless them He has. On November 29, the young women moved into a beautiful two-story house that will serve as their new transition home. Equipped with sewing machines and a training area so they can bring their internship work home, the house has more than double the capacity&mdash;allowing space for six more women to eventually take residence. One of the young women, Shefali (pseudonym), gives this account through translation&#58;<em> &ldquo;I really like it here. We have been given a big house, and both the upstairs and downstairs are very nice. Don uncle has sent us money for this, so many thanks to him.... I am enjoying my studies. I am also going out to work part time. In a few months we will be able to go for work alone and that makes me happy.&rdquo;</em></p>
