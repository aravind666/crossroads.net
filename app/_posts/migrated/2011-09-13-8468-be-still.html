<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Over  and over, the Bible reveals extraordinary experiences of early  followers of Jesus. And these adventures were the result of listening  and responding to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The  Holy Spirit has been described as Gods still, small voice that you can  hear or sense. But in the business of life, its easy to drown that  voice out. In order to lead a life of adventure, you must first be  willing to be still and listen. Seems counterintuitive,  right? Yet, we see it in account after account from the Bible. A life  led by the Holy Spirit is exciting, because you realize your life isnt  yours to own or control.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Close  your laptop, turn off the music, and move out of the company of  co-workers or family. Ask the Holy Spirit to come into these moments,  then be still. Listen. It may take a few minutes to settle your mind or  push aside the days responsibilities. Dont be discouraged. Write down  any thoughts or promptings you have, and then ask God to confirm if any  of those are from him. And just so you know, while He could be  whispering, "Move to Africa," its probably much more likely that you  could hear, "Ask Bob for his forgiveness." Both take courage to act  upon...but more on that tomorrow.</p>
