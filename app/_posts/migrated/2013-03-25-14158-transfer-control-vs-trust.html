<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at some choices we need to make in the middle of our beans and rice fast this week, choices to transfer our investment.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:12&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 13:12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus applies banking principles to intellect. It is easy for us to lean into our own intellectual resources to reason and sort through decisions, dissecting until we are far from the original heart. You might find yourself using reason to justify or adjust your original commitment to fast this week. Or you might use it to judge. In these moments, we are teetering on falling outside of the heart of this spiritual exercise. In moments where you need to make decisions about integrating the fast in your daily life, lean toward trusting God instead of control; they dont coexist well.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write about ways that you are likely to get caught up in your own mind instead of looking for Gods heart.</p>
