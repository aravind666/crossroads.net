<p>Signs and Wonders</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to be near to you in this time.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:43&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:43</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>These signs and wonders didnt show up as crop circles, baseball players on an Iowa field, or someone being able to see dead people. But they did cause people to be awe-filled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, many people find it hard to believe in wonders and signs. There must be some sort of logical explanation for miraculous things, right? Even among Christ-followers theres a general feeling that miracles may have only been for biblical times and may not occur today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its little wonder theres little wonder left.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The word miracle is taken from the Latin word miraculum, meaning something wonderful. What are the something-wonderfuls that youve seen? What about ones that have included you? How do you see and acknowledge them, instead of just passing them off as coincidences?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write down one or two something-wonderfuls that youve noticed, and thank God for them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
