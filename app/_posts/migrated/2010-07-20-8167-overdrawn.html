<p>Overdrawn</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Reflect for a few minutes on Gods grace. Not as something in the past, but in the present.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20John%201:9-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 John 1:9-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of us like the first part of this line. Its the second part where we struggle. Its the only part of the prayer that Jesus expanded on in Matthew 6:14-15. Why?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe its because if we ask God to forgive us in the same way that we forgive others, technically, were asking to have as broken of a relationship with God as we do with the people who we cant forgive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus keeps writing checks to cover our mistakes. If we are to be more like Him, then we have to do the same. Withholding forgiveness leads to a hardened heart in which Gods will cannot be done and Gods kingdom cannot come to its fullness.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask Gods Spirit to soften your heart toward the people who have hurt or angered you.</p>
<p></p>
