<p class="normal noPspace">Thanks for taking time to check out this blog and dig deeper into this dream called CityLink. It&rsquo;s something that has been years in the making&hellip;since 2003, in fact. But despite some of our past challenges, in all my years with CityLink, I honestly haven&rsquo;t been more excited about our vision: &ldquo;Working together. Reducing poverty. Changing lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">In the Old Testament, the prophet Habakkuk says, &ldquo;Look at the nations and watch&mdash;and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.&rdquo; (Habakkuk 1:5)</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">I believe this is what God is saying to us now. Despite the fact that the poverty rate in Cincinnati is nearly twice the national average, despite the racial division we&rsquo;ve experienced in our city, despite the disparity that we currently see in our city between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots,&rdquo; I believe we&rsquo;ll all say in 2040 that Cincinnati is a different city. I believe we&rsquo;ll be utterly amazed. And I believe we&rsquo;ll say that God did something in Cincinnati, through imperfect yet passionate and faithful people like you and me, that we would not believe, even if we were told.</p>
