<p>Enough</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Take a few minutes and reflect on what you know about the personality of Jesus.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108868620332&amp;s=0&amp;e=001m0fWInpY1VF3XNSKG2bjepdB55CdGY7RNK8w7nO_m5xD2q-h_4i5YTeIK9Y_LZsjytLsR7ruJf0aFv7cTHujrOB75xD9B4E0VfzBcaWh-9Q_PS-De4YukXbSLOjHAv174dulfN0w0IPpEN5qs4KmLAVIsAGUZ3OeX9XJZ0_fNTOuQusYgDcGWkwAokZ6IWRFz6tV9fKO_Wk4Q9rGwTuh2CNTlggn6SpV" target="_blank">John 14:5-9</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It  happens again: someone asks to be shown God. This time, however, its  thousands of years later. And its Phillip (not Moses) who is asking  Jesus to do the showing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What Phillip doesnt understand yet is that Jesus is  God. He doesnt know its Jesus who restores the relationship between  man and God to one of complete knowing and love. The same relationship  Adam had with God before Adam turned away. The relationship Moses wanted  from God but couldnt experience. The relationship were offered and  can experience because God is in love with us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Simple  drawing assignment, no skills required: Draw an ocean wave. Then draw a  line that splits it in half (i.e. the parting of the Red Sea miracle  that Moses experienced). Write "God" above it. Then next to your wave,  draw a cross (i.e. the Jesus that Philip experienced). Write "God" above  that, too. Then consider that the same God who split the Red Sea in  half and died on the cross is pursuing you.</p>
