<p><strong>Monday, May 16 </strong><br>The Spirit of Kindness</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before reading the scripture today, spend a minute just being quiet and preparing to hear Gods voice.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%202:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"> Romans 2:1-4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Last week, we examined patience. Patience suggests a more passive approach to love in the face of provocation. Often patient love will go unnoticed. But kindness is an active expression of love toward God and others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kindness and judgment dont mix. If youre looking down on someone (even if theyre in the wrong), you arent receiving or reflecting Gods Spirit of kindness. Kindness means acting with grace and mercy toward imperfect people. It often stands out as an unexpected response, because it isnt what the recipient "deserved."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do you know someone in your life who needs kindness, whether or not theyre asking for it? The Holy Spirit will give you his power of kindness if you ask.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2018&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 18</a></p>
