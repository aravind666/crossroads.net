<p>Trust is Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please continue to remind me that you are the Prince of Peace and in total control.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Ephesians%202:14-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 2:14-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we gain wisdom (i.e. we see how God used a situation in our life), only to forget His power the next time a difficult situation arises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Things will happen that throw us off track. Life will get ugly, complicated, confusing. And well all continue to have questions that wed love for God to answer. We want explanations for things that dont seem right or fair. Maybe well get those answers today, next week, in a few years. Or maybe we wont. But the reason why its possible to be OK with the I dont knows, the no answers that C.S. Lewis described, is because we believe in an all-knowing, perfect God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fully trust God, no matter the circumstance, and you will experience peace in abundance. </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If youve felt peace about something these past couple of weeks, or if youve ever felt peace, take a few minutes and thank God for bringing you that experience. Keep your peace notes as an encouragement for the future. </p>
<p></p>
