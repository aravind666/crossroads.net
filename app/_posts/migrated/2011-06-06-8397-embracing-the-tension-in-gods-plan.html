<p>Embracing the tension in Gods plan</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust you through lifes uncertainty. Help me trust that the ups and downs of my life are all part of your greater plan - a plan that goes beyond what I can comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:1-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>One reason its hard to put our trust in Gods great, overarching plan for our lives is that our perspective is limited. When jobs, family, friends and our personal passions compete for attention, it can feel like were walking through a cluttered attic with the lights off - all the outdated furniture and boxes of old clothes make it hard to find the door without banging your shins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But this poetic passage shows us that theres actually order to the chaos, that if we have faith and keep stumbling forward, well eventually find a wall, or a familiar fixture that orients us toward the door were seeking. Gods work is complex beyond what we could possibly understand, and certainly can seem like a collection of random events. But the verses well explore this week can help give us a glimpse of how we can embrace the tension in Gods indescribably complex master plan.</p>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider the structure of this passage, how every action listed has an equal, balancing reaction. Now consider events in your life that balance negative and positive stress. Write out a brief list of things that cause negative stress in your life (i.e. a challenging work environment, or a relationship that keeps you up at night). Next to that list, see if you can write out aspects of those same things that bring you joy (the job satisfaction that motivates you to work hard, or the things about your relationship that inspire you to be the best person you can be). Does the list balance out?</p>
