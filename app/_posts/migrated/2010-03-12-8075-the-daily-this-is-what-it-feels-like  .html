<p><strong>Friday, March 12</strong> <br> This Is What It Feels Like<br><br><em><br>Todays edition of The Daily focuses on an original song written for the Free journey by Andrea VonAllmen. Follow along with the lyrics while you listen to the song. Ask God to meet you during this time, and to speak to your heart about the freedom he has in store for you. </em> <br><br><br><strong>From Andrea:<br></strong>Ive heard people describe what freedom is, but never what it feels like. This song is a laundry list of experiences that resemble the feeling of Gods kind of freedom. <br>Notice: all the things listed in this song feel AWESOME!<br><br><br><strong>Lyrics:<br></strong><em>On an open road with no destination<br> Leaping from a plane with a surefire chute<br> In a room of glass with a baseball bat<br> A dog let off its leash<br> A bird in its cage, released<br><br> A blank canvas, dreaming with eyes open<br> Shooting weightlessly through the atmosphere<br> The first page in a book unwritten<br> Wind (moving) through the trees<br> Sunset painted just for me<br><br> This is what it feels like to be free<br> This is what it feels like to be free<br><br> A brand new day with no past behind me<br> A wad of cash and a shopping spree<br> No time, no debt, no fear, no doubt<br> Dancing in the rain<br> Screaming out<br><br> This is what it feels like to be free<br> This is what it feels like to be free<br><br> Ive seen a glimpse of what freedoms like<br> Ive tasted but not satisfied<br> A longing deep to be set free<br> Breaking loose from what chains hold me </em> <br><br><br><strong>Listen:<br></strong><a href="/downloads/playMedia.php?idMedia=1024">Click here</a> to listen to This Is What It Feels Like.</p>
