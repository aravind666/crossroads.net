<p>A New Tactic</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%203:21-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 3:21-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus story didnt begin with his human birth in Bethlehem. He existed as God from the beginning of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Adam and Eve chose to separate themselves from God by choosing evil over truth, God banished them from the Garden of Eden so they wouldnt live in a perpetual state of choosing evil. But even amidst this pained separation, God never stopped loving his children. His tactic, however, changed. He would become a human, as Jesus, and live side-by-side with the children he so loved.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God for the love to forgive others past bad choices, and for his forgiveness for any destructive choices you have made.</p>
<p></p>
