<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>God is Speaking to You</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to speak to you in a way you can understand.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+19%3A11-13&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">1 Kings 19:11-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Signal-to-noise ratio is a term used in science and engineering that explains the power between meaningful information and background noise. Thats a fancy way of asking which is louder, useful or useless information? When Elijah went out on the mountain he experienced some pretty big stuff---a rushing wind, a great earthquake and a fire. But God did not speak to him through any of those big, mighty wonders. God spoke to Elijah in a whisper against all of the noise surrounding him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This weekend we discussed that God speaks in a language unique to each of us---whether it be science, art or just plain old quiet time, God speaks to us. This week, well explore what our personal signal-to-noise ratio might be.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Recall a time when you believe God said something to you. What do you remember about where you were and how He spoke to you? Its OK if you dont remember or if you dont know, this is an exercise to figure out where you are.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 15</a></p>
