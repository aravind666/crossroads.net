<p class="noPspace">Hello againMark here. For those of you who follow this blog, you may remember me from <a href="/india/2013/04/26/14397-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-go-india.html">8 months ago</a>. (I was the guy with all the reservations about going to India.) Well, about two months ago I had the privilege of joining 16 other people who decided to follow Gods call to Kolkata, India, on the October 2013 GO India trip. Id love to share with you a bit about my experience, and five beautifully simple lessons I learned along the way.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Dont overthink it.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">As you may have read in my previous post, I had come up with every reason imaginable NOT to go to India. From Im not qualified for this, and Guys dont do this kind of work, to Its too much money, and This is waaay out of my comfort zone. The turning point for me happened one night after bedtime prayers with my seven-year-old daughter when I shared the struggles I was having with my decision to go. She turned to me and simply said, Didnt you say you were going there to help people? So, what are you deciding?</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>You dont need much to serve.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">My prayer before I left was for God to make me uncomfortableto show me the realities that I conveniently shielded myself from in my day-to-day life. God came through. My luggage didnt make the trip with me and I had chosen to ignore the cautionary measure of packing an extra set of clothes in my carry-on. As a result, I spent all but one day of the trip with no luggageonly the clothes I traveled in and a single outfit I was able to purchase while I was there. It took me all of a day to shake off the initial shock and terror, take a look around me, and realize that Id be just fine.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Brokenness is all around us.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">I was told many times before the trip that you cant really prepare yourself for what youll see in India. That was right. We met girls who had been rescued from lives of sexual slavery, children (branded with the mark of their owner) begging for food, and saw the tremendous disparity between the rich and the poor. After reflecting on all of this as a group, we discussed that while this brokenness was extremely visible in India, the deceiver is just as real and more deceptively present here in the U.S.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Redemption is real.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">After the first few days of the trip, I feared that I would leave India with a hopelessly heavy heart. But the remainder of the trip had quite the opposite effect. We were fortunate enough to meet some true heroesfrom the welcoming and vibrantly evangelical community of the Kolkata Christian Fellowship church, to the workers and staff at Freeset (a fair trade business who employs survivors of trafficking), and finally to the amazing community at the Mahima aftercare and transition homes. We had the indescribable pleasure of spending time with these amazing young women, witnessing firsthand the hope and redemption that can come through quality care saturated with love.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Find your Kolkata.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The last few days of our trip left us feeling exhausted in body, renewed in spirit, and wondering how to process everything we had been through. What were we to do with this experience? How were we to engage? The answer came on our last day during our visit to the home of Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity. It was as if God himself was speaking to us in the words that hung on the wall of the mission:</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><em>Stay where you are. Find your own Calcutta. Find the sick, the suffering, and the lonely right there where you arein your own homes and in your own families, in your workplaces and in your schools. You can find Calcutta all over the world, if you have the eyes to see. Everywhere, wherever you go, you find people who are unwanted, unloved, uncared for, just rejected by societycompletely forgotten, completely left alone.</em></strong></p>
