<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Good Sons and Daughters: Choose Action</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we look at where we are in the story. Focus on verses 29 and 30.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:28-30%20&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21:28-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When the father in the parable tells his sons to go work in the vineyard, one is all talk and one repents and chooses action. Where do we fall in the story? Do we have good intentions but never follow through? Or do we want to choose action? God desires for you to choose action because that is the only way his Kingdom will advance. It also shows that you trust Him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write down situations in your life when you have just talked and not followed through. Then write down situations where you have chosen actions. Think about where you have seen fruit from choosing action.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 4</a></p>
