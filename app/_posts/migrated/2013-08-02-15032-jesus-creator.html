<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Jesus: Creator</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue looking at Christs identity through this passage in Colossians. Todays focus is verse 16.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 1:15-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God is eternal. We may box Jesus in as finite, but he was present through creation and continues to live. In Jesus, Gods identity is fully present. How often do we consider that all that there is was put in place by Jesus and for Jesus? There is no division between the divine and the daily--in Jesus it is all holy.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What in your life are you glorifying or minimizing? How could you live so that all is holy, and belongs to Jesus?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 1</a></p>
