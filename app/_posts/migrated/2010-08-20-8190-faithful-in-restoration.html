<p>Faithful in Restoration</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Revelation%2021:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 21:1-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the Bible, God makes promises to his peoplesome big, and some small. Looking back over that history, we see that many of the promises were fulfilled, including some that we examined this week.</p>
<p><br>But not this promise of a new heaven and new earth. It hasnt been answeredyet.</p>
<p><br>We can trust, though, that God will answer this promise, </p>
<ul>
<li>What promises of God have you seen fulfilled?</li>
<li>What parts of your daily life make it hard for you to believe this promise? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Read through todays passage a couple more times, and imagine what that day will be likewhat you would see, how you would feel, and so on. Then ask God to help you live in this promise as you go through your day.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>We talked this week primarily about Gods faithfulnesshis reliability in keeping the promises he makes.</p>
<ul>
<li>What experiences in your past make it difficult for you to believe that God will keep his promises?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What promises have you seen God keep?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The promises God makes at the end of the Bible match up with the ones God makes at the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about the idea that this kind of whole-world restoration has been Gods plan all along?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What parts of your daily life make it difficult for you to believe this?</li>
</ul>
