<p>Before the Beginning: God had a Plan</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you remaining faithful to your purpose to restore all things.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:1-2&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 1:1-2</a>;<a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:8-10&amp;version=NIV"> 2 Timothy 1:8-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When you are in a precarious situation, its always reassuring to hear someone you know and trust say, Dont worry, Ive got a plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays scripture records the very first act of the new story God began writing when he created in the beginning. When God spoke the world into existence, it wasnt only an act of creation; it was an act of redemption. He has a plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its reassuring to know that God is not caught off-guard by the broken world we live in, and that even now he is at work restoring the world to wholeness. Through Jesus, he beat death and brought about a new beginning, and we can participate in that new life right here--and right now.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>This is about the time when we finally see signs of spring popping up. Longer days, flower buds, and (fingers crossed) warmer weather. Take time to notice these signs of spring, and offer a prayer of gratitude for the new life that is growing in you because of Gods redemptive plan.</p>
