<p><strong>Friday, February 12</strong><br>The Good Race</p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:7-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><br>Galatians 5:7-9</a><strong> </strong><br>(Click to view the scripture online.)<strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong><br>The easiest part of a race is the beginning. Youre full of energy, your legs are fresh and youre focused. But at some point, voices pop up in your head. You start feeling some pain and think, Is this really worth it? You see a hill and a voice says, You could just take a detour and save yourself the agony. However, if we listen to these voices, we rob ourselves of the joy of persisting and running the race to completion. Sure, we might gain some temporary comfort, but were sacrificing something much larger and more fulfilling in the process.</p>
<p>These voices also speak to us in our daily life. They tell us that following Jesus in difficult situations isnt really worth it, and that we can save ourselves some discomfort if we compromise just this once. But as Paul says in this letter, A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough. Soon we find that small choices of comfort over truth in one area lead to comfort becoming our defining ethic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in your life are you allowing voices to convince you to settle for something less than what God wants for you? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask God to show you a place where youre gravitating toward comfort rather than following his plans for you. Thank Him for equipping you with everything you need to run a good race and ask him to show you what persistence looks like in that area.</p>
