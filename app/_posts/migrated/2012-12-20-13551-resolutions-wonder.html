<p class="noPspace"><strong>Resolutions: Wonder</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">You might have a New Years resolution in mind to get healthy, be more disciplined, or do that project you keep putting off. The Daily would like to encourage you to look at five New Years Resolutions for the soul. Commit to bolster your beliefs this week and throughout 2013.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When we take the time to look at the world with wonder (like a little child) it changes us. Its easy, especially on a busy day, to center in on our own life. The more we broaden our lens to see all that God has created, how he cares for creation, and the beauty of it all (including His image in people), our life and all its problems begin to shrink by comparison. Living a life where we open our eyes to the wonder of life and creation, fills our souls with hope and conquers worry.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take a moment to picture yourself in a moment in your life: your house, your apartment, your work. Then, like a satellite picture, begin to zoom out. Picture your neighborhood, the state, the country. Keep going until you are out in space looking down on the earth. Now with your wonder goggles on, tell God some things of which you are in wonder.</p>
