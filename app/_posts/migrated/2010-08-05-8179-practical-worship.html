<p>Practical Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2061:1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 61:1-3</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAKE ACTION</strong></p>
<p>Today well take the idea of worship as reflecting Jesus character to others, and put it into practice. Take a moment right now and consider the people youll most likely interact with in the next 24 hours. Kids, friends, co-workers. Make a list of the people youll be alongside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then ask the Holy Spirit to guide your time, and go person by person, praying a blessing over each name and asking God if theres anything in particular youre to prop up in that person today, to encourage, or to comfort. Then listen and obey. It might seem scary, or totally foreign, but remember, this is an act of worship (and youve already danced, so its not that scary). It isnt your job to come up with the right words. Thats the work of the Holy Spirit. Just listen and obey (and worship).</p>
