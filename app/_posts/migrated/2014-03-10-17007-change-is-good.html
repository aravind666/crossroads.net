<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Change is Good</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week were spending time with God and with people we trust to find out how we can change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to soften your heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A1-5&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 7:1-5</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+36%3A26&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Ezekiel 36:26</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Change is a good thing. It means were growing. And when it comes to all this Bible stuff, it means were growing in our relationship with Jesus. But admitting we need to change can be very scary, too. Luckily, Ezekiels words tell us that God will soften our hearts toward change. Whatever walls weve built around it, God will break them down. In their place Hell give us not just a new heart, but a new spirit that will guide and help us make the change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What might God be asking you to work on? If change doesnt come easy, ask God for a new spirit to guide you, but be ready to follow.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 2</a></p>
