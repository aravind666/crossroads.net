<strong>Friday, January 15</strong><br>A Promise for Everyone<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Proverbs 2:6-8<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>We go to a teacher to learn history, to a coach to learn a sport, and to a master to learn some type of craft. But where do we turn to learn wisdom? After all, wisdom is an acquired skill just like any of these.<br><br>According to Solomon, we go to God.<br><br>Put simply, our ability to be wise is directly dependent on our connection with the source of wisdom itself. As we connect in relationship with God, we grow more aware of his heart and desire for the world around us. This awareness enables us to live wisely.<br><ul>
<li>How has connecting with God enabled you to live wisely in the past?</li>
<li>What keeps you from asking God for wisdom?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>As Solomon said, our ability to be wise comes from our relationship with God. Take a few minutes to write a letter to God, telling him the ways you want to know him better and asking him to give you wisdom.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>James 1:5<br><br>__________________________________<br><br><br><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong><br><br>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.   <br><br>We talked this week about how wisdom can affect our relationships. Regardless of the specific situation, the Bible is clear that a wise life has a significant relational impact.<br><ul><li>How have you been impacted by the wise choices of others?</li></ul>
<ul><li>How have your wise choices been a blessing to others?</li></ul>
<br>The Bible is also clear that God is the ultimate source of wisdom; in many ways, it is simply an outward expression of our relational connection with him.<br><ul><li>This week, how has a focus on God helped you make wiser choices?</li></ul>
