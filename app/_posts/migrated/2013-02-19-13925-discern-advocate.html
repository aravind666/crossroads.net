<p class="noPspace"><strong>Discern: Advocate</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">What if we set out to listen for God? How can we be sure when we do hear something that its Him? This week we are looking at how to discern.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:7&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">John 16:7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Sometimes when we listen, we may realize that we are off course. Jesus gave us his Holy Spirit to be with us in those moments of course correction. When you get a sense that youre off course, that is the Spirit whispering to you. Hes advocating for your best interest--that you would become more like Christ. Sometimes we have a sense of being off course, and instead we begin to beat ourselves up, feel shame, or even fear. The enemy accuses. The Spirit advocates. Pause to recognize which you are experiencing and youll know which voice you are hearing.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Walking through our life without an advocate is like walking into court without an attorney. Right now, picture walking through your day with a spiritual advocate at your side.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20peter%203&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">2 Peter 3</a></p>
