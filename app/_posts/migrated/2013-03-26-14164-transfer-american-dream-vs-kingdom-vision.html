<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out The Daily supporting you through your beans and rice fast today. Remember that rice absorbs the gas created by the beans--you can make it!</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:43&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21:43</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The American Dream says that you can make something of yourself-- go to college, start a business, make money, have a wife, kids, send them off to college, retire and die. The American dream says invest in yourself.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Kingdom Vision says invest into eternity, that we can be a part of something bigger than our own story, that there is a larger purpose to all of this hub bub and busy-ness. Jesus, the leader of this Kingdom movement invested (or maybe divested) his whole self toward an eternal purpose that you and I, 2000 years later, are still impacted by. Being a Christ follower means following his lead, Jesus vision of giving our life over to a King that we can trust, toward a mission larger than ourselves.</p>
