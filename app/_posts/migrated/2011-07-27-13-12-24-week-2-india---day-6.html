<p class=\"noPspace\">Today our team was joined by International Justice Mission (IJM) counselors to go to an aftercare home Crossroads hasn&rsquo;t been to in the past, called Rescue Foundation. They do rescues as well as have an aftercare home in Mumbai with more than 100 women, girls and their children, although their capacity is 50.&nbsp; We arrived in the morning and started with planned activities. Katherine, a Crossroads&rsquo; volunteer, has experience in therapy/counseling and shared a ball-tossing game that had each girl focus, participate, and feel included and connected. The girls were hesitant at first to engage but the &ldquo;koosh&rdquo; balls were soft, colorful and fun to throw. The next movement activity required each girl to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the activity. By the time we did it a few times, they were more creative and eager to take their turn.&nbsp; The final activity was to have the girls make puppets. They had lots of options on materials and especially had fun using the shiny, sparkly, studded jewels.&nbsp; Several of the girls made beautiful birds, maybe to represent being free!</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\">We all joined a special lunch catered in for the girls by the Crossover Foundation. It was biryani (flavored rice and chicken), salad (cole slaw) and gulab jamun (deep fried dough in sugar syrup) &ndash; what is served at special events/festivals. The girls really appreciated having special food, and we had the opportunity to eat with our fingers. A quiet, reserved girl who had been rescued by IJM came up to Muriella and quietly said, &ldquo;From childhood I&rsquo;ve never had a happy day, and today I am feeling very happy!&rdquo; The day ended with the girls expressing their thanks to the group, and we couldn&rsquo;t help but feel we were the ones that received way beyond what we gave.&nbsp;</p>
