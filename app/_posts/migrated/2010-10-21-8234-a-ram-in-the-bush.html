<p>A Ram in the Bush</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to thank God for the amazing ways he has shown up in your life.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%2022:13-14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 22:13-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Abraham was given an unbelievably difficult request from God: Give me your only son. For Abraham, all his hopes rested in his son, Isaac. We all have an "Isaac" in our lives. The person or thing we value above everything else, and do not want to surrender. Whats your Isaac? What emotion comes to mind when you think about putting your Isaac on the table?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>In the end, God did not take Isaac from Abraham but he was pleased that Abraham was willing to give him up. As difficult as it might be to pray this prayer, ask God to give you the willingness to put your Isaac on the table.</p>
