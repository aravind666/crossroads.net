Our lives have totally changed from this. We are on a strict budget and have paid off two full debts. At this point after the journey, we're almost done paying off a third debt.<br><br>Since we started tithing, God has blessed us. Every month He made sure our ends met and has blessed us with unexpected money that has allowed us to pay huge portions on our debt snowball.<br><br>Every day we feel His strength getting us through hard times and through living a lifestyle totally counter to what our culture defines as success. In 18 months, we will be totally debt free, except our mortgage. This would not have been possible with out God showing us that we need to be a blessing with our money and providing a pathway towards a life that honors Him.<br>
