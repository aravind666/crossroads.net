<p class="noPspace"><strong>James: Power of the Tongue</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">As we continue to study the book of James, were focusing on the power of our tongues.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of ones life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>James 3:3-6 (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Todays-New-International-Version-TNIV-Bible/">TNIV</a>)</em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Bits, rudders and sparks. James gave us three simple but powerful analogies to describe the power of our tongues. Spend a moment considering how people have reacted to things youve said this week. Which direction is your tongue steering you?</p>

<p class="noPspace">God, thank you for who you are. Please help me put my words to good use.</p>
