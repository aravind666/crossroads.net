<p><strong>Week 2: Minor Prophets</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever put a lot of thought or effort into something and then felt like someone else disrespected your work? Then we can only imagine how God, in his perfection, must feel when we disrespect the systems he puts in place for our benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes we might have a feeling that the things happening around us just dont feel right, fair or just. That sense of justice is planted within us when we were created in Gods image. In fact, its planted in us because we are Gods plan to bring justice to the world, to care for the poor and the oppressed. We are not only intended to live justly ourselves, but to give justice away to those who need it most.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Habakkuk ends in Chapter 3 with a song. Habakkuk calls the people to remember how God is amazing. This is a call to take the focus off of themselves (ourselves) and reconnect with our Father.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Theres a pattern in these Old Testament Minor Prophetic books. The Israelites (the original intended audience) loved to receive Gods blessing, but didnt necessary like to pass it on. Today, consider the ways you are blessed. Write down a list of things you are thankful for in your life and in His character (like Habakkuks song). Then ask God ways that you can pass on blessings to others.</p>
