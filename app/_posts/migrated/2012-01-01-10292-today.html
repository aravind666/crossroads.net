<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Spend a few minutes telling God about the day ahead of you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The funny thing about New Years resolutions is how they can overinflate our self-image, making us think its up to us to make it a better year. Maybe we pledge to lose weight, quit drinking or volunteer more. And while none of these are bad, theyre typically rooted in the false assumption that were strong enough to do it on our own. We figure if we can just do a little more, be a little better, than well earn ourselves a happier year. Exhausting.</p>

<p class="noPspace">But theres an alternative. We can drop the whole resolution bit and step into the flood of Gods grace. We can say that today, January 2<sup>nd</sup>, well rely on Gods power, not our own brute strength or good effort. Well believe in His love for us and quit trying to earn merit badges. Well be calm and open-handed, knowing we can trust Him to work through and around us. Then, instead of egos and exhaustion, we will find His freedom.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Happy January 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Find a place to record Gods activity in your life this year. Try to write at least one sentence in it today.</p>
