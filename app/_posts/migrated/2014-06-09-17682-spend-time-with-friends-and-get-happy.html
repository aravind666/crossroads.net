<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Spend Time with Friends and Get Happy</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were diving into a new series all about the meaning of happiness, wealth, family and love. This week well explore what happiness means, no matter who we are or what weve been through.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for your friends and ask him to keep surrounding you with good people.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+1%3A12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 John 1:12</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A18&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Getting to spend time alone is great for our personal sanity (and for us introverts), but God did not create us to do life alone. Thats why when we spend time with others, be it our family, coworkers or friends, our joy is complete. That doesnt mean every interaction is a happy one---we need our friends when times are tough, too. Whether were celebrating or we just need someone to listen, we are pursuing joy when were with others.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you have a reason to celebrate or need to get something off your chest, make it a priority to spend time with others today or this week.</p>
