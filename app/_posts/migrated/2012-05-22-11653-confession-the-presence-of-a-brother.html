<p class="noPspace"><strong>Confession: The Presence of a Brother</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Were learning about confession in this final week of our study on the book of James.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"A man who confesses his sins in the presence of a brother knows that he is no longer alone with himself; he experiences the presence of God in the reality of the other person. As long as I am by myself in the confession of my sins everything remains in the dark, but in the presence of a brother the sin has to be brought into the light."</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Bonhoeffer echoes<a href="">James teaching</a>that confession is meant to be done in community. Were often given the beautiful opportunity to see God in others, as well as being Gods hands and feet to the people around us.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>If you feel a nudge toward confessing something, do it today. (In-person is always best, but emails and phone calls are fine in a pinch.) Find a trusted, spiritually mature friend with whom you can share in confidence.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REMINDER</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Our friends from Grace Bible Church in South Africa are leading prayer this morning from 8-9am at Crossroads Oakley. Come to pray alongside them, learn from them and experience God in community.</p>
