<p class="noPspace"><strong>Resolutions: Faith</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">You can make a "get healthy" resolution if you like, but the Daily is looking at having a healthy faith. If youre in a hurry today and cant read all of Hebrews 11, also known as the faith chapter, read verses 1-6 and then 38-40. (But its like doing the extra crunches if you go for the whole chapter.)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001dZ_OEKlV9cxN7NAAsKO_8moAWckjfjGLtLoSbjKZu2eXVvHYR29JPpvvjqgKORcZUUmQlaD7sImm8hTSEnqmoFjX0Ae994ykmXxRY1poDMXUl2TKIejce6YPsPN33cwASFiyRRutV1sBgakHMbQN5fnialH4riOrBgeb_RLsjo2UbNT_0dvSLD0rD_ZOvj0MX9E3zRu46AU=" shape="rect" target="_blank">Hebrews 11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When we remember all of the people throughout the Bible who lived their life by faith, and that God created all of what we see in the world from nothing, our faith will swell. Its only human that we want to know and see the end before we start, but since these are New Years resolutions for the soul, lets focus today on trusting God daily, even when we dont know where we are headed next. Thats faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The writer of Hebrews makes a list to remind us of our spiritual lineage of faith, but you can write a list just based on your own life and story. Take a moment to journal a list of ways that God has shown up for you in your life.</p>
