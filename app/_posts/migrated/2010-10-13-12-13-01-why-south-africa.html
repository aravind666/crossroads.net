<p class=\"noPspace\">This is the  second in a series of thoughts on why we are working in South  Africa.&nbsp;For the first post, please <a href=\"/blog/view/3/39\">click here</a>.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">South Africa is a  country rich in natural resources (one of the wealthiest countries in  Africa) and is quite modernized compared to its neighbors. Heck, the  country successfully hosted the World Cup this past summer.&nbsp;So, why does  a country like this need our help?</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The answer is that despite its many advantages,  decades of brutal, exploitative Apartheid rule have left South Africa  with an avalanche of poverty and health problems. Yes, parts of South  Africa are on par with the West in terms of quality of life. But, though  Apartheid ended almost 20 years ago, the country is still destructively  segregated; no longer by law, but by economic, social and health  issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Parts of South Africa have incredible wealth, but the majority  has been left to live in extreme poverty.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong> Consider these statistics&#58;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The average life  expectancy for a male in South Africa has decreased over the last 20  years from 70 to 47 years of age</strong>.&nbsp;In the U.S., the average life  expectancy for a male is 75 years of age.</li>
<li>In South Africa, 59 children under age five die  per 1,000 live births (compared to eight in the U.S.), making it one of  only 12 countries in which this number has consistently increased since  the early &lsquo;90s.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s almost 75,000 children dying each year. </li>
<li>Rates for diabetes, heart disease, cancer,  kidney disease and mental illness are two to three times higher than the  average for developing countries.</li>
<li>South Africa has <strong>17% of the world&rsquo;s HIV/AIDS  cases&mdash;5.5 million people.</strong>&nbsp;This is 23 times the global average. Over  350,000 new people die annually, and around 1,350 people are infected  every day.</li>
<li>Tuberculosis case notifications in South Africa have risen four-fold  since 1986, and the infection rate is seven times the global average.</li>
<li>The injury death  rate is almost double the global average, and nearly half are caused by  interpersonal violence, mostly between men.</li>
</ul>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The health problems in South Africa are HUGE  (and it&rsquo;s safe to say the numbers are even worse for Mamelodi  specifically). Unfortunately, the public health system is wholly  inadequate.&nbsp;South Africa spends more money on health care than many  countries, but over 60% goes to the private sector, which only affects  14% of the population.&nbsp;Most people in Mamelodi do not have access to  this care, and we, the Church, are not going to wait for the government  to get the necessary care to those who are dying.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">I&rsquo;ll end with a quote  from a recent report on South Africa done by <em>The Economist</em>; \"On taking  over as minister of health a year ago, Aaron Motsoaledi declared himself  &rsquo;shocked&rsquo; by the state of the public health-care system. Media horror  stories about dirty and overcrowded hospitals, long waiting times, lack  of medicines and a shortage of medical staff were largely true, he  admitted&#58; &rsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will be an exaggeration to say that some of  our hospitals are death traps.&rsquo;\"</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Yes, there are people in the U. S. suffering, and  our priority is to care for them (that&rsquo;s what <a href=\"http&#58;//www.citylinkcenter.org/\">CityLink</a> is all  about), but, if Jesus commanded us to care for the sick (without  specifying geographical lines), can we ignore a place where people are  dying at unthinkable rates, with no real hope for things to get better?</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">*Most of the  information in this post comes from a report on Health in South Africa  in <a href=\"http&#58;//www.thelancet.org/\">The Lancet</a>.</p>
