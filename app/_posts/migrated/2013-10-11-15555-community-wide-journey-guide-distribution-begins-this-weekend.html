Everyonefrom kids to the old folksis on the same page, learning about the same topics and growing in similar ways. A Journey consists of three parts: the weekend message, small group interaction and individual experiments. For the six weeks of the journeybeginning October 12it is the main thing. Everything else shuts down. Everyone participates. Everyone is challenged.</p>
