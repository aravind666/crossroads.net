<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Safety nets are not bad. A trapeze artist appreciates them greatly. In fact, the safety net causes the trapezist to take greater risks: swing higher, leap further, and trust the grip of their partner more.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether you have financial safety nets available in your life (savings, credit cards, family) or spend time wishing you had more, the bigger question is: Are those nets bringing you more freedom or more fear? No one can answer that question, but you. No one can decide for you whats too much or too little, because this isnt a number game its a heart matter.</p>
