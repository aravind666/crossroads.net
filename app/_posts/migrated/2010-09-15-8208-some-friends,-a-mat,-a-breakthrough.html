<p>Some Friends, a Mat, a Breakthrough</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see where you can take action and experience the miraculous.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%202:1-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 2:1-12</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Cutting a huge hole in a roof, dropping in on a shoulder-to-shoulder intense crowd, and asking Jesus to heal your friends bodythats bold. Thats putting yourself right into the path of a miracle and asking for the full experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us would have seen these crazy guys coming in through the roof and said, Wait your turn! or maybe, Give Jesus some space. But Jesus didnt turn these guys away. Instead, He commended the guys for their faith in him. And their bold actions allowed them to experience a miracle that many people didnt get to have.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are you not experiencing the miraculous because youre sitting on the sidelines? Maybe you need to cut through a few roofs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment to ask God to show you a friend who needs your help. Then go and help them no matter what it takes.</p>
