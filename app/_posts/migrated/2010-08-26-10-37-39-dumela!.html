<p class="normal noPspace">Dumela! (That&rsquo;s hello in Sotho, a South African language). If you&rsquo;re looking for the South Africa blog, you&rsquo;ve found it. This is where you can read the latest about our plans to bring quality medical care to people on the outskirts of Mamelodi Township who lack access to even basic medical care.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">You&rsquo;ll see updates on what&rsquo;s going on with our partners, as well as stories from teams on the ground in Mamelodi working to make this vision a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Our hope is that many of these stories will encourage you to participate in the conversation about how God is using our work in Mamelodi not only to help South Africans but also to help us see God through surrendering to His vision.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">So, consider subscribing, or check back to this blog for stories, pictures and videos. We hope you&rsquo;ll participate in the discussion about showing love to people hurting on the other side of the world.</p>
