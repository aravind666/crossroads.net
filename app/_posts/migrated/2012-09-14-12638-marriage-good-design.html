<p class="noPspace"><strong>Marriage: Good Design</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">During the Knock-Off series, well see what the Bible has to say about the real thing when it comes to marriage, dating and family. This week were learning how marriage is a covenant, not just a contract.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001uEx74FR9tOpmu0QES8Vgj5Yh7qND8flvnX7lzexnMmhrK-FPPaY3A2jktdgtb72eyX3bHsTTAgpWbF1afoaxOvKotNWMBM7ZJYBsJXoqaEYKzEFsQPKfupuVzLvJTE_-ikH5X5BM-HKIeeJR_OIleuH6fjf8Pn10ygh_p-XHkO2VIDqW7TMLiqdm0HAbSmI-2tYTeJ8edKmjlARokla0Pg==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Genesis 2:23-25</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This describes Gods vision for marriage since the beginning of time. That vision includes two really good parts (no pun intended): that we would be as one, and that we would not hide ourselves from each other (or experience shame). Marriage is not two equal parties entering into a contract with each other. Its a covenant God makes with one party (man and woman together).</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Try journaling for five minutes today about the implications this view of marriage might have on your relationship with God, or with your spouse.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001uEx74FR9tOpmu0QES8Vgj5Yh7qND8flvnX7lzexnMmhrK-FPPaY3A2jktdgtb72eyX3bHsTTAgpWbF1afoaxOvKotNWMBM7ZJYBsJXoqaEYKzEFsQPKfupuVzLvJTE_-PTUgcaWvxcRSXG6uiI2MaFxjwfN5a8OrZpfQO-hXXNcfV8VJu-nMYgZMPp6B7chxM2ib7ryYYFQjC_SHEfOkrA==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Colossians 4</a></p>
