<p>Shortsighted</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me hear your voice today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2032&amp;version=NIV">Exodus 32</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Moses is the only one seeing the bigger freedom story, here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the Israelites may have left their physical slavery behind them in Egypt, nothings really changed. They havent yet realized that this journey toward Gods freedom is far more about relationship than it is about how far across the desert theyve walked. So in the short time that Moses is up on the mountain, they get antsy, forget about the Red Sea or the food from heaven that God provided, and tell Moses brother to make them a new god.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But before we judge them too harshly, we often do much the same thing. Its called taking control back into our own hands when God has already shown us the freedom route.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Share with God an area, situation or relationship where you struggle to trust Him, and then just sit and wait in that moment. Allow Him the space to speak back to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weekly Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>God wants to bring us from slavery to freedom, but its often challenging to let go of what keeps us in bondage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think we cling so tightly to the things that keep us in bondage? Give an example of something you have had a hard time letting go.</li>
<li>If youve let something go, what have you refilled that space with? If you havent refilled that space, talk to God and community about ways you could.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The consistent theme running through this journey toward freedom is one of trust.</p>
<ul>
<li>God can often ask us to do things that appear way outside our norm. How have you seen this in your life? Nothing is too trivial, here, to mention.</li>
<li>How has God used your pain to bring you or others around you to a place of greater freedom?</li>
</ul>
