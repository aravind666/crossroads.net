<p>A New Kind of Kingdom</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%2013:1-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 13:1-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>The book of John is one of four Gospelsbiographies of Jesus told from different perspectives. The books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all capture the story of Jesus time on earth, and also provide a glimpse of how each individual man knew him. They are intimate writings, like finding out about someone through their best friend.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays passage from the book of John reveals how the new kind of kingdom Jesus came to establish is one rooted in humility. All of Gods power and personality were made human in Jesus, yet he washes the feet of his disciples (close friends). God turns the concept of an earthly kingdom on its head with Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Humility is the key, not power, and this is the very character of God made real in Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Is there a person in your life who needs to understand the humility of Jesus this week? What is a modern way that you could wash their feet (serve that person)?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%2015:33-39&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 15:33-39</a></p>
