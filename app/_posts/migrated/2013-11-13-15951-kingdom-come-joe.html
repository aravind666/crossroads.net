<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Kingdom Come: Joe</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Heres a story from Joe. He went on a GO New Orleans trip this summer where he met a friend who is seeking Gods Kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JOES STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I served this summer in New Orleans where I interacted with so many people who showed me a little piece of the Kingdom. One man in particular stands out. His name is Mack and we met on the first day we arrived in the city. Before Hurricane Katrina, Mack had a great house nearby and he loved to fix up old cars in his garage. He accumulated quite the collection. But it was all swept away when Katrina hit. He lost his house, his cars, everything that had made him happy and kept him busy.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Mack spent several years in a depressive state trying to get his life back. This all changed when an old building down the street went up for sale. He thought about leasing or buying the building to restart his hobby, but something in his heart told him to do something better. God spoke to him. He put renovating his home on hold and began renovating the building to be a Community Center.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">With the help of donors and volunteers all across the country, the Community Center is helping to renew the Ninth Ward through a range of services like literacy, job training, community meeting spaces and recreational facilities including a large skate park and basketball center for kids.</p>

Through that troubling time, God was working through Mack to bring the Kingdom to so many people. Mack inspires me to forget about always trying to achieve and to focus more on showing this Kingdom to others so that I can truly receive whats good.
