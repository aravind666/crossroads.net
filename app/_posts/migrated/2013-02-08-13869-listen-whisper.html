<p class="noPspace"><strong>Listen: Whisper</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to improve our spiritual hearing this week, as we actively listen for God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%2019:11-13&amp;version=TNIV">1 Kings 19:11-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">In this verse Elijah had been fearfully hiding in a cave. God hints to Elijah that He is about to speak, and of course, like Elijah, we assume that God will be in the big. But no, He is in the quiet, in the whisper. When we sense that God is about to speak, when we have the spiritual hairs rise up on the back of our neck, much like Elijah we must go to the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p class="noPspace">It is easy in a busy world to plow past small nudges, intuitions or whispers. Its like hearing a distant train whistle, and unless we find the space to listen to the divine, the train can be upon us. So much better to listen as we move, and to find where and how in our lives we can go out of our fear and distractions, to the opening of the cave.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Journal today about some places or spaces that you have been able to hear Gods voice. Make a list of some ways you could go to the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thessalonians%202&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">2 Thessalonians 2</a></p>
