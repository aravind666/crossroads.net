<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Go Outside</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were exploring how God speaks to each of us. Today, well spend some time outside.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to say something to you through his creation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A20&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Romans 1:20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When the first snowfall of the year came we all watched it magically fall and cover the ground. And now, were counting the days till spring. No matter the season or the weather, nature is all around us. Paul said all of Gods creation tells us something about him and if we look close enough and spend time outside, well know God better than we did before---even in three feet of snow.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The weatherman says today is the first warm day of 2014. Even if its raining and slushy outside, put on your rain boots and make time to go outside. Whether its a walk around the block at lunch or a stroll through the park. Spend some time outside and look for Gods fingerprints on what you see.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 2</a></p>
