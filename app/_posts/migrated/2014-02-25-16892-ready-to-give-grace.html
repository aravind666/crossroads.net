<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Ready to Give Grace</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were exploring how we can let go of our stuff and give grace and truth to each other in the midst of hard situations.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you grow today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">John 1:14</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A4-30&amp;version=CEB&amp;interface=print">John 4:4-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Each interaction we have with Jesus is an invitation to receive his grace and new life. That means coming to terms with some hard truth. Like the Samaritan woman, we can try everything to avoid the conversation, but Jesus wants us to confront ourselves and uncover the truth so we can live as God created us. He knows who we are and what we carry with us---and hes ready to give us grace.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How often are you giving people grace and building people up in your daily conversations? Today, be ready to give grace and love to the stranger who holds the door for you or to the friend youve known since kindergarten.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 5</a></p>
