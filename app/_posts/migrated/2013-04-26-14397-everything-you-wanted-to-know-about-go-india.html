<p class="noPspace"><strong>*(But were afraid to ask.)</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Hi. Im Mark and Im a volunteer. For the last two years, Ive helped with writing and posting India blog entries, and have even done graphic design work for the India team. This month, I finally decided it was time to actually step out of the boat (and get on a plane) and GO to India. Oddly enough, this wasnt an easy decision for me. Suspecting that I may not be the only one with a heart for India with reservations about GO-ing, Ive decided to share some of what Ive learned over the last few months in hopes that it might encourage you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>Reservation #1:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>I dont think Im uniquely qualified to really help someone who is a survivor of sex trafficking. What can I really do to help?</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">Many of my fellow volunteers have been on GO India trips. Despite their constant reassurance that each person on each trip makes a significant difference, and that their particular skill sets werent any more qualified than mine, it wasnt until the recent visit from Crossroads partners, Keith and Ramona Dsouza, that it really sunk in for me. Ramonas insight was very simple and resoundingly clear: By just making the sacrifice to be here, youre helping these girls understand their worth. She pointed out that while we wont be digging wells or moving cinderblocks, the moments of sharing prayer, a simple conversation, or even the latest dance (still questioning my qualifications in this area) are all ways to help build into them. Keith also pointed out that each trip offers different kinds of opportunities. For example, sometimes trips involve taking Crossover staff, Indian church partners, or women living in the aftercare homes on retreats. You could end up passing out sheets of paper, facilitating group discussions, getting conversations started, or just making events run smoothly. Serving those who spend most of their lives serving others (or havent been served much before) makes a huge impact. The moral of the story is: every person will contribute something meaningful on a GO trip no matter what skills, talents, background or level of extrovertedness (fairly certain I wont be teaching grammar) they have.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>Reservation #2:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>Im a guy, and I know these women have had horrible experiences with men in their lives. Im sure theyd much rather have female visitors.</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">The answer to this one was a bit of a duh moment for me as it was so logical. Its because these young women have had horrible experiences with men that it is so important for men to GO on these trips; for them to see men who reflect Gods love and see themselves as the person He created them to be. Rick June, a past GO India trip participant, shared this insight: The presence of men in this ministry is really important to achieve. I found Crossover Foundation staffespecially womenwere appreciative that their work is valued by men. They experience so many negative images of men in their work, so seeing godly men willing to sacrifice time and energy for their support and growth is an encouragement.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>Reservation #3:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><strong>My exposure to and understanding of Indian culture has been limited to my (frequent) visits to a local buffet restaurant. Im going to have some serious culture shock.</strong></em></p>
<p class="noPspace">This answer has two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uh, yeah. Isnt that part of why youre signing up? Isnt that part of the adventure? Im being called to experience God in new way, and doing so may require me to get a little out of my comfort zone. He died for me... yeah, I think Im good with a little discomfort!</li>
<li>That being said, Crossroads prepares you out the wazoo (technical term) for these trips. In addition to a packet of materials and guidance on how to raise financial support, youll be invited to three or four pre-trip meetings where theyll talk about culture and travel logistics, and plan on-the-ground activities. They promise they wont throw you into the deep end, abandon you in a crowded market, or force you to find your way across Mumbai with 15 rupees and the name of your hotel.</li>
</ol>

<p class="noPspace">Speaking of preparation, Im sure some of you have lots of other questions, so we created <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xjkcclhx14fvf03/GoIndiaSpecializedFAQ12%20REV.pdf">this handy Frequently Asked Questions sheet</a> for you. Above all, pray about it. If Gods nudging you toward this but you dont know how youll scrape the money together, youre in good company. Maybe youll take a leap of faith and join us this October, maybe youll decide to go on another trip further down the road, or maybe youll decide to do something else to get involved. Either way, I encourage you to get out of the boat with me and go be the church. Ready to GO?
