<p>Summer</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, let me be reminded that I am to stay diligent in searching you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2030:25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 30:25</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20139:23-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalms 139:23-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Summer  is a season of busy-ness, even for animals as small as the ants. They  know their work and they are busy doing it. God has laid work before us,  as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its  time to transition from the newness of spring to this season of work.  Otherwise, our hearts will turn to idle restlessness and the luster of  spring will lose its gleam. Now is our opportunity to put our love into  action, to engage in the Kingdom. But equally important is the internal  work of summer. Let God refine your heart during this time. Let Him be your motivation instead of doing work for show.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Choosing to move into the season of summer is a choice to sustain the good work that the Lord has begun in us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take  a few minutes and ask God where he wants to work in your life. He wants  to lead you in deep and unique ways, so ask Him what it looks like to  engage in the Kingdom.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%205&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 5</a></p>
