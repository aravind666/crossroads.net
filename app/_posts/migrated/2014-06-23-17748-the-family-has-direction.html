<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The Family has Direction</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were redefining the words happiness, wealth, family and love. This week, well rediscover how big, small, and present our families can be.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you the purpose for your family.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A10&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Galatians 6:10</a>,<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2016:9&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print"> Proverbs 16:9</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If youve been on a road trip with your family or friends, you know its not unusual for the driver (ahem, dad) to refuse to ask for directions. Maybe youve even been that person (its OK). But directions are important. They tell us where weve been and, most importantly, where we are going. Good, healthy families stop, ask for directions, and pursue them. We dont always know how were going to get there, and theres probably a pothole along the way, but God has a purpose and a vision for where his family is going.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In your family---biological, softball team or mens group---what is your purpose or vision? Brainstorm with God the places he might be leading you. Do something to follow His direction.</p>
