<p>Battle Weapons</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Just  after they crossed the Jordan River, the first city the Israelites had  to conquer was the powerful city of Jericho. Standard military tactics  would probably call for the Israelites to lay siege to the city. But  once again, God shows us that his ways are not our ways. God chose to  win this battle through the weapons of prayer and worship, not swords  and shields. He instructed Joshua to fight this one differently, while  also promising him that the battle had already been won.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When were faced with challenges, we can be tempted to think we should always be doing something.  This can be overwhelming, and we dont know where to start. God offers  us battle weapons that are far mightier - prayer and worship.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Today,  face your challenges from a context of worshipping God. As you pray  about your obstacles, instead of asking God what you should do, just  worship. Tell God how awesome he is, play some worship music, whatever  feels like worship for you. As you "march and blow the trumpets," trust  that God will "topple the walls."</p>
