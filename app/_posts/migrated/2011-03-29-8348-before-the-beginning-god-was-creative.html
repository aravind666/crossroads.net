<p>Before the Beginning: God Was Creative</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for your gift of creativity.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208:22-31&amp;version=NIV">Proverbs 8:22-31</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>How often do you picture God with a paintbrush in his hand, a tool belt around his waist or Adobe Illustrator on his screen? As we read today in Proverbs, part of Gods essential nature is his creativity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God created this universe so that we can be filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, rejoicing in his whole world. But God doesnt stop there. Not only does He want us to enjoy creation, but he has also gifted us to be creative. So whether youre building a business or building a house, you are reflecting the character of your creative God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Its easy to overlook our own creative gifts, so at some point this week take time to simply create. That might look like cooking a meal, painting a room or writing a marketing plan. Just do at least one thing that leverages your creative gifts and brings you joy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
