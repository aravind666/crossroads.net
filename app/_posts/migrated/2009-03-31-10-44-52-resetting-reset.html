<a href="../../reset" title="Reset"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/legacy/content/Reset/ResetBanner445w.jpg" alt="" width="445" height="71"></a><div>As we enter our final (recap) week of <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Reset</span>, I am realizing that - unlike past journeys - this one is really just a starting point. It is a kind of "stripping away" of assumptions and excess baggage to make the path forward more bearable and accurate.<div><br></div>
<div>So in light of all of this, here's a web-only challenge. Can you summarize your Reset journey in three words? Here are mine: <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Surrender To Truth. <span style="font-weight: normal" class="Apple-style-span">I've realized that truth is not something to be conquered, but something to be surrendered to.</span></span>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>So do you have three words that summarize your experience? Feel free to leave them in the comments. <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">IMPORTANT RULE:</span> three words only. No explanations. (C'mon...it'll be fun. Maybe.)<br> <br>
