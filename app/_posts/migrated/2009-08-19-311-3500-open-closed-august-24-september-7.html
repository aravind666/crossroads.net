<html><body><p>We love having our Oakley building open to the community. But a few times a year, we close the building for scheduled maintenance and do those big clean-up jobs you wouldn't want us doing while you were sitting and enjoying your coffee. So, take note: <strong>The building will close from Monday, August 24 through Monday, September 7. </strong>All<a href="/3500"> 3500 Open</a> activities are canceled, but <strong>weekend and Last Wednesday services will continue as scheduled. <br></strong></p></body></html>
