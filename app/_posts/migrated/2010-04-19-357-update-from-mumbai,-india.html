<p>Crossroads volunteer Jamie Elkins used to work as a paralegal in a downtown Cincinnati law firm. On the 2009 GO Mumbai trip, she came face to face with young girls who had been rescued from brothels living in aftercare shelters. Deeply affected by the experience, Jamie is now working in Mumbai as an intern for one of our key partners in justice work, <a title="International Justice Mission (IJM)" href="http://www.ijm.org">International Justice Mission</a>. Jamie loves to send word to friends back home about how Crossroads support of IJM means saved lives in Mumbai.</p>
