<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Build Leaders: Notice</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish up the week by focusing on verse 6.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:1-6&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 39:1-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We all may notice things in our work that others get stressed about. See those times as an opportunity to serve the people in authority over you. In stressful situations, the natural response is to turn away and avoid it as much as possible. The things that we naturally want to turn away from can often be things that the Lord is trying to grow us in--like patience, grace, self control or humbleness. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today when a stressful situation comes up, instead of shying away, run toward being a servant. Be intentional about noticing where you can serve those in authority over you. </p>
