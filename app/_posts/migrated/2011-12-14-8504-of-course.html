<p>Of Course</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Ask  God to fill you so completely with his goodness and glory that you  cant wait to tell others about what youre experiencing.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108958813496&amp;s=0&amp;e=001shgykEV1t8R9TgLh6jMDSySBONB63AXstBccTYEV1d_CFLg2qs4jtJYiy3q1a8NFKJ8ESxD_5bJv_UrdSG3ZfX6qyIZt6uFKuRE0JTCb4ekFo-X1zAAn94KP6CytqbeHXEHkTCsOJdOc3J6v_QksLHJ-G_AgL7MI_Wi0boTD016-GbVQddsexH8cF16-vsIbxOzD7Ish7lNX9flkZB5g1fQcUjiNVDAP" target="_blank">Luke 2:8-20</a> (even if you know some of this by heart, read and enjoy)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Get  into this story for a minute. God didnt yank the shepherds off the  field, show them his son and then shove them into the surrounding  neighborhoods to tell people about what happened. It was of their own  volition. It was opening day and theyd been given Diamond Seats. They  didnt even consider going back to work. They didnt worry about who was  ready to hear about what happened, and who wasnt. It was an "of  course" response. Like Jeremiah. Like a maven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Whats something you loved or that happened and you were so  excited about that you couldnt stop talking about it? (Dont pick  Jesus for this one.) Consider the way you told other people. Did you  text, call people you hadnt talked to in a while, create something in  response to it? Think about your style of sharing. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
