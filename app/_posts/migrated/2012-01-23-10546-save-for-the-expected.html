<p class="noPspace"><strong>Save for the Expected</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week were looking at ways to put money in its place. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God, help me to focus on you this week. Please give me a clear mind to receive your wisdom, and an open heart to receive your love. Help me to put You at the center of my week, not the stresses and concerns of money. Amen. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%206:6-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 6:6-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The Bible encourages us to save for the expected, from saving for our next vehicle to building up a college fund. Hoarding for the unknown, however, is typically driven by fear and greed. Spend a few minutes thinking about how the truth in todays scripture might apply to your life. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Consider your savings (or lack thereof). Ask God to help you think of one way to begin saving more intentionally, or to redirect some savings that might be motivated by fear or greed. Be open to how God might direct your thoughts, then follow through if something comes to mind.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2017&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 17</a></p>
