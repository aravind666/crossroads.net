<p>Come, Rescuer, Come</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2025:1-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 25:1-13</a> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Revelation%2022:12-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 22:12-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>During  Advent, we celebrate God the Fathers promise of Jesus, who came as a  baby 2,000 years ago. Jesus is now with the Father (while His Holy  Spirit lives in us) and he will come again. We dont know when this will  happen, but Jesus will return to earth to reward some with the tree of  life. This is the very tree of life from which Adam and Eve were  banished.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The best of Gods promises was, and is, the coming of Jesus. And the further promise that He will come again.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Be  filled with joy over the fullness of Jesus birth. See the vulnerable  baby as the way God loves you like a perfect father: tender, gentle, yet  full of promises that he will fulfill. God, the father, is for you. He  has proclaimed it in Jesus birth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2024:36-47&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 24:36-47<br><br></a></p>

<p></p>
<p>The  birth of Jesus leads to his earthly ministry, death, resurrection and  being "God with us" still today. What are some ways that looking at this  true story over the past three weeks has allowed you to experience God  in a fresh or renewed way?</p>
