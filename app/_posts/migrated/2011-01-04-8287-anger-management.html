<p>Anger Management</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, give me the strength to be calm in the midst of conflict.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2015:1&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 15:1</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It might seem obvious: respond calmly when people are angry, and theyll cool off. Or add fire to fire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But what about looking at this in a proactive way, rather than reactive? So instead of thinking about past arguments and how they fit in this description, think of future ones. More specifically, think about how being angry and resentful toward someone can actually become a habit. We get stuck in a rut with how we react to them, and so changing that reaction in the moment of conflict feels nearly impossible. Unless we choose a new course ahead of time, and ask God for the strength to be calm.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes to ask God if there is anyone you need to respond gently to, then ask him to help you figure out how to do so.</p>
