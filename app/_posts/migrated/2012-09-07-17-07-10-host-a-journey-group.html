<p class="noPspace"><strong>This year’s journey starts in less than a month. And more than ever before, we’re asking for hosts who post.</strong> In other words, we’re asking you to host a small group for this year’s journey in the fall ("be a host"), and make your small group available for others to join, preferably by posting your group on our Find-A-Group online tool ("who posts"). The only requirement to be a host is to open your home for for six weeks (approximately two hours a week.) Whether you can take in two new people or ten, every post allows those who aren’t currently connected to find a group.</p>
