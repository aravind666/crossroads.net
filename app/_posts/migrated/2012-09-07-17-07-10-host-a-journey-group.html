<p class="noPspace"><strong>This year&rsquo;s journey starts in less than a month.&nbsp;And more than ever before, we&rsquo;re asking for hosts who post.</strong> In other words, we&rsquo;re asking you to host a small group for this year&rsquo;s journey in the fall ("be a host"), and make your small group available for others to join, preferably by posting your group on our Find-A-Group online tool ("who posts"). The only requirement to be a host is to open your home for for six weeks (approximately two hours a week.) Whether you can take in two new people or ten, every post allows those who aren&rsquo;t currently connected to find a group.</p>
