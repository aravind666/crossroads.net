<p><em>God, I want to receive from you in all the ways you have for me. Remind me of how simple it can be to hear from you today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Peter%204:10-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 4:10-11</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God speaks in so many different ways. Sometimes its barely audible. Sometimes its loud and obvious. Sometimes its in a dream. Sometimes its a phone message from a friend. It can be hard to receive from God in ways were not used to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Heres what someone has to say about receiving from God through community:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had no idea how hard it would be to receive from God, and receive from God through others. I used to think my hesitation was because I didnt want to be selfish. But then I realized its because receiving means getting really humble. When I was waving aside Gods attention on me, I was actually saying, Im fine on my own. Youre not necessary. Big, troubling statements. So the first thing I do now when Im getting prideful and independent, is get brave and receive some help.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>So...accept some attention. Its not easy, but tell God and your Jesus-following friends what you need and how you feel. Thats being humble. Then, when God responds, thank him.</p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong> <br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 2</a></p>
