<p>Take the Adventure</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to reveal his adventure to you and to fill you with boldness.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2082:3-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 82:3-4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God didnt design us to be wallflowers. Were created for movement, excitement, freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past couple weeks, weve been looking at how following Jesus is an all-out adventure. We might not all take care of orphaned children, travel to remote villages or slay giants on a battlefield. Your adventure might feel smaller-scale at times, or closer to home, but when youre living with boldness and staying open to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, its an adventure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write down one fear that holds you back from living in the freedom of Gods adventure. Above that fear, write someones name (or multiple names) who would benefit from your willingness to take the adventure. That person trumps your fear, so cross out the fear. Then talk to God about what movement you should make, and take your first step.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p>Read Psalm 82:3-4 again, receiving the words as marching orders.</p>

<ul>
<li>Whats something that would encourage you to keep pursuing an adventurous life? Talk about what action or behavior you will put into place. </li>
<li>Discuss anything thats happened these past few weeks that felt like a bold move for you, whether it was small-scale or big. </li>
<li>When have you asked for Gods power to move through you? If you havent, is anything holding you back?</li>
</ul>
