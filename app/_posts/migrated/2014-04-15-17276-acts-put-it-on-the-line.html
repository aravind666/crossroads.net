<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you something new.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+21%3A12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 21:12-14</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul was leaving for Jerusalem and everybody was trying to talk him out of it. It was going to be horrible. He could be arrested, beaten or worse. But Paul knew Jesus wanted him to go and he wanted to obey him. That doesnt mean he was oblivious to what might be ahead, but he knew there was more at stake. No matter what it meant for him, Paul was ready to put everything on the line for Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What are you ready to put on the line? Maybe its not everything, but today try giving up one thing for Jesus. Pay attention to how it felt to give something up and what happened when you did.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 21</a></p>
