<p><strong>Week 6: Game Change</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, November 15</strong></p>
<p>Well Done!</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>This weekend we changed the game! You may feel incredibly pumped after making a commitment or perhaps youve experienced a roller coaster of emotions. Regardless of how you feel right now, remember that the last six weeks were all about growing in our ability to hear God and do what hes asking. We do this because God is and always will prove himself faithful. Because you stepped out in faith, lives will be changed (starting with your own). This week in The Daily well celebrate how the Game Change journey fits into the bigger picture of Gods story.</em></p>
