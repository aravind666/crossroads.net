<p class="noPspace normal">"Why South Africa?" is  the most common question about our work in Mamelodi.</p>
<p class="noPspace normal"></p>
<p class="noPspace">The simple answer is  we believe that God has called Crossroads to work in South Africa, and  that trumps all other factors. But we know that many in our community  want to know more about why we feel called to South Africa. So, starting  with this post, you will see a series of posts with various insights  answering the "Why South Africa?" question. And then well provide a  summary at the end.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">First, Id like to start with a passage by  C.S. Lewis from his book <em>Mere Christianity</em>:</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 25px;">If you do not take the  distinction between good and bad very seriously, then it is easy to say  that anything you find in the world is of God. But, of course, if you  think some things really bad, and some things really good, then you  cannot talk like that. You must believe that God is separate from the  world and that some of the things we see in it are separate from His  will. <br><br>Confronted with a  cancer or a slum, the pantheist [believes God and the world are one] can  say, If you could only see it from the divine point of view you would  see that this also is God. The Christian replies, Dont speak damned  nonsense. For Christianity is a fighting religion. It thinks God made  the worldthat  space and  time, heat and cold, and all the colours and tastes and all the animals  and vegetables are things that God made up out of His head as a man  makes up a story. But it also thinks that a great many things have gone  wrong with the world that God made and that God insists, and insists  loudly, on our putting them right again.</blockquote>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Our take is this</strong>: There are people dying of disease in Mamelodi. And its not from God.  Its our job to make it right, regardless of the sacrifices we must make  in money, time and effort to do so. Keep an eye out for <em>Why South Africa?  Part 2</em> coming soon.</p>
