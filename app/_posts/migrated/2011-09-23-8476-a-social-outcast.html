<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Twelve  years of bleeding. Thats an incredibly long time to suffer, especially  when it meant that you were forbidden to be out in public. So this  woman knew she was taking a risk just leaving her home, and that if  anyone recognized her she could get into serious trouble. She was taking  an even bigger chance touching Jesus. He was a big deal. But she knew  He could heal her, and so she touched him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then,  after 12 long years, it was over. She was healed. It would have been  easier and safer for her to sit by and hope Jesus would happen to stop  by her house. But this woman wasnt passive by any stretch. She acted  boldly and reached out for His strength, and in her action she  experienced the<em> miraculous.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do  you need to be healed but are ashamed of asking, or feel like youre  not worth it? Ask boldly for God to heal you of your suffering, no  matter what form it has taken.</p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily  features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These  questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your  roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>Weve  spent this week looking at people who threw themselves into the  miraculous. And what happened? They got to experience things of which  others only dream. Not because they were special or perfect, but because  they were willing to act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever felt like God was calling you to be part of something amazing? How did you respond?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully,  weve been growing closer in relationship to Jesus because were  hearing stories about people who take action and then experience him  more fully. </p>
<ul>
<li>What miraculous stories, from your life or others lives, could you share with others?</li>
</ul>
