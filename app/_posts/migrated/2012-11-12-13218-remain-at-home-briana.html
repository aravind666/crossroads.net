<p class="noPspace"><strong>Remain at Home: Briana</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Briana is 24 and has cute bangs. Her rapper name is De-Bri (even though shes not a rapper).</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>(If you missed this weekends message, watch a video summary<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0017Fi0UFZ7gLeD05FWMSD2rNWN11GyZ6tZuQyR1AO0_tMMXnoyZeNHr-7_XAhryKWJBI8tleW-dkqpjVSMd5uX5T58sy57Y8oP73y1yCXhi2othTfBDMY5mvV3c3G7Y4pH" shape="rect" target="_blank">here.</a>)</em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET BRIANA</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"I like to think of home as being the safe place where mistakes can be made; as a place to rest, and the place to be filled back up (like coming home from college for the weekend to do laundry and eat a nice meal). Its funny because were not taught that remaining in our parents house is a good thing. Rather, once we hit a certain age, we should be out on our own. Like many, I was taught to be independent and Im realizing that I wanted to do anything but stay at home, and all of this comes into play in my relationship with God. I come to Him when I need something--forgiveness, rest, food (and laundry?) and once I have it, in my heart, I am out the door on my own again.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Amazingly, God desires for us to stay with him always, because as much as he desires to provide for our needs, he wants tobewith us. And what Im realizing more and more is that no matter how good or bad our parents raised us, God--the one who hems us in--is our perfect father. He does everything for the building of our character, he does everything right, and he knows us. The more I ask for that to become a reality to me, the more I see how good my Fathers home is, and how good it is to stay there.</p>
