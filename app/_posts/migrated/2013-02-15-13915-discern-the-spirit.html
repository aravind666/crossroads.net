<p class="noPspace"><strong>Discern: The Spirit</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Have you ever thought, <em>I think that was God?</em> I think He might be talking to me, but Im just not sure. Last week we focused on listening for God, this week well look at how to begin discerning when you think you might be hearing.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:9-13&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 11:9-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Its good for us to remember that God, our good Dad, wants to be with us--to answer, and to open the door when we knock. Lets pause, though. Look at what Jesus is saying he will give us when we ask, seek, and knock. For all that we are pursuing and looking for, He will give us his Spirit, a gift that will continue to be with us. As we listen for Gods voice, and discern how to follow Jesus, God has given us the perfect guide.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Today, pause and ask God to give you more of his Spirit.</p>
