<p class="noPspace">During the Journey Home series last fall, the Crossroads’ community was invited to take part in an immersive prayer experience designed to help participants feel at home with God and to let go of burdens God never intended for them to carry. Three months later and 8,000 miles away, five people on a specialized trip to India replicated this prayer experience for the staff of Crossover Foundation, Crossroads’ partner in fighting sex trafficking in India. It was a chance for the people of Crossover, who work hard to help others find freedom, to reconnect with God and receive his blessings.</p>
<p class="noPspace">�<br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Rick June was one of the Crossroads volunteers on the trip. “I lived in 17 different cities before I was 30, so the concept of ‘home’ was a bit challenged in my upbringing,” he explains. “During the prayer experience at Crossroads, I felt God revealing many of the emotions I had felt as a child, things like loss of friends and physical security. I began to understand how these feelings had kept me in bondage. The release I experienced [during the prayer experience] was really significant.”</p>

<p class="noPspace">In India, Rick jumped at the opportunity to bring that same feeling of freedom to those who help young women find healing and restoration on a daily basis. “Because of my own experience of releasing burdens I wrote on the luggage, I asked to be at the station where participants dropped their luggage off,” he recalls. “What touched me most was seeing visible changes in their faces and postures when they did this. We didn’t speak, but I could see that they were experiencing the same thing I had in an entirely different country and culture.”</p>
<p class="noPspace">�</p>
<p class="noPspace">The prayer experience, held on a beach in the State of Goa, was part of a retreat the Crossover staff took to rest, recharge and receive. “Demanding schedules and the emotional nature of their work had really sapped several individuals’ sense of conviction,” Rick says. “Our workshop and social time was very fruitful, and as everyone experienced a slowing down, God’s voice was more evident. As they left, many told me how restored they felt and how much stronger their energy and purpose was. We ended the week with one of the best affirmation experiences I have ever been part of—a true showering of love, affection and trust. It was so strong that one participant leaned over to me and said, ‘I wonder if this is what heaven is like!’”</p>

<p class="noPspace">Shirley Lobo works in communications at Crossover Foundation and says the retreat was the breather she really needed. “The music, the encouragement, the journey through the stations—they helped me unburden,” she explains. “I always knew God wanted me to be worry-free, but somehow I have evaded that completely. When it was time to ‘carry our weight’ I cried out to God because I was so harrowed by what was on my heart. It helped me laugh again deeply from within. It dislodged the baggage for sure.”</p>
<p class="noPspace">�</p>
<p class="noPspace">Dalreen Noronha, a Crossover administrator, says each step of the prayer experience was a meaningful reminder of God. “The right people were waiting at the right place with the right word to build into me, like a light on a hill. I truly felt that God tailor-made this session personally for me. God refreshed me through this session and has drawn me near to him.”</p>
<p class="noPspace">�</p>
<p class="noPspace">Crossover president Keith Dsouza calls the retreat and prayer experience “one in a million.” “When I physically put the briefcase down, imagining that I had let go of the load, I felt so light,” he remembers. “I cried that morning thinking of the burdens that had been put upon me. It was then that I decided to let go, and let go I did. I’m a free man. Something changed—I suddenly felt that I was a boy once again, pelting stones along the beach, feeling wild and free.”</p>
<p class="noPspace">�</p>
<p class="noPspace">Rick hopes retreats like this become part of the regular rhythm of life for those that give so much of themselves for the work of God’s Kingdom. “I feel strongly that this should be an annual experience for the Crossover staff,” he says. “The trust that grew between them will be a source of strength for the team.” Folks at Crossover echo that sentiment. “You all have not only blessed me, but also my precious Crossover team,” Keith says. “What an awesome experience!”</p>
