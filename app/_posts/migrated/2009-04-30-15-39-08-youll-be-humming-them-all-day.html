Hey parents...you know how you spend much of your &quot;driving around&quot; time trying to numb yourself out because you just listened to&nbsp; &quot;The Wheels On The Bus&quot; for the 700th time in two days? Well... <strong>Kids' Club</strong> has just released a new collection of music that's sure to make those road trips a lot more enjoyable. It's really great and you can download it for free <a href=\"../kidsclub/music.htm\">HERE</a>.
