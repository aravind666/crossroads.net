<p>Trust in Jesus name</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Jesus, teach me to trust in the power of your name.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%203:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 3:1-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>What would it be like to be this beggar? Every day, well-intentioned people carry you to beg at the city gate. You might tell yourself that this is all God has for you. You might become cynical when wealthy people throw you a coin and maybe feel good about themselves, but who really notices you or cares?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter does. He breaks through the human grid of understanding of what is right. He doesnt assume its just to give this man a coin or even to religiously carry him to the gate to beg. He understands that Jesus name changes everything. Peter has experienced the maker of the universe in human form, and he knows, personally, how that has changed his life. He speaks out with that authority and the crippled man walks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we allow the power of the good news of Jesus to impact our lives, we will know that authority and trust in its power.</p>

<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Is there someone in your life like the beggar in this story, someone youre accustomed to see suffering? What would it look like to pray in Jesus name that they are healed?</p>
