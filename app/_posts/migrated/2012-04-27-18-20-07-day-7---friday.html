<p class=\"noPspace\">Well, this is it. Our last night in Mumbai. But before we talk of our day, I should set the scene for all of you back in Cincinnati. After a few hours of laughing/crying/sharing stories and memories we&rsquo;re bringing back with us to the States, we&rsquo;ve now devolved into a 70&rsquo;s/80&rsquo;s/90&rsquo;s \"throwback\" lip sync party, complete with portable ipod speakers and really bad singing.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">This is a special group.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">And today was a special day, as we witnessed a dream of Keith and Ramona D&rsquo;Souza (the founders of Crossover) become a reality. Crossover had worked and planned for months to create a first of its kind Justice Prayer Gathering in the city of Mumbai. Partner organizations, churches, and peers were all invited to come worship, learn, pray, and act together on behalf of these girls. It was such an honor to see people pouring into the auditorium, and to hear these friends and warriors share with conviction why the God we serve is passionate about justice. Their invitation was to come and join them in the fight, and the over 700 people in attendance responded in kind.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">We also had the privilege of watching the debut of a 15 minute short film Keith had commissioned, telling the stories of a few girls who have been rescued, shot in the brothel they occurred. It was moving (to say the least), and it illustrated the reality of their lives to every person in the room. No one in the room can ever say \"I didn&rsquo;t know\" after this afternoon.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Overall, this trip has been significant for me. Personally, its been a joy to be back in a city I&rsquo;d come to miss, and its filled up a place I hadn&rsquo;t realized had gone dry. I&rsquo;m a thankful man for opportunities like this. In addition, the team that&rsquo;s been assembled has been outstanding. Its been a joy to work alongside each of them, and the ways they&rsquo;ve integrated with each other and the girls has been inspirational. They&rsquo;re a special group of people, and I believe because of their faithfulness to the call from God they each received, there have been blessings that exceeded their wildest dreams.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Because of that, I&rsquo;ve asked a few of them to share some thoughts they have will sitting here tonight. Below are a few of their reflections. At the bottom you&rsquo;ll find Brandon&rsquo;s final reflection from his first week ever outside the US. Thanks for writing, commenting, and praying along side us. We&rsquo;ve felt the prayers. Its been an incredible 8 days.</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>There is something incredible about signing up for this trip as an individual and returning with a community of what seems to be a thousand deep. Meeting and sharing life with the Crossover Foundation, pastors and their communities in Mumbai was inspiring and offers hope that this mission will not cease when we return. God is unifying, and the community He is building in Mumbai is active and growing. I would encourage anyone to come here and jump in to God&rsquo;s redemption story for these girls.</em></p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>In the midst of the most disgusting&nbsp; and unimaginable circumstances these girls have gone through, this trip has revealed hope. Encounters with the girls, visits to the aftercare homes, and meetings with the Church leaders revealed the way God has been working in this battle. Keith and Ramona have so much passion for Christ and the girls who have been trafficked. We are blessed to have them leading Crossover and the fight for freedom for the girls. Even though it feels like we are fighting an up hill battle, it is important to remember that we can&rsquo;t do anything and have to trust in the Lord. One thing I will take back with me is that Jesus is there when we cry out His name and His name alone. This trip is not about receiving... Giving love, time, attention and care to these girls is all they want, and as a result, one receives. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. God is so good!</em></p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Our trip is winding down, and it&rsquo;s hard to believe that Friday has come to a close. One more day left and I wish that we had ten more to go, and maybe even ten more after that. Our group is sitting outside on the outdoor patio, jamming to some nostalgic songs, and listening to the traffic honk and drive by below. Though we may not have completely adjusted to Mumbai, I believe our group has made a valiant effort. Today, after an admittedly easy morning, we were hauled off through traffic to an auditorium across the city where several hundred people gathered together in attendance for the Crossover Foundation prayer gathering. Hundreds of people took off work to be in attendance, some traveling over four hours to get there and lay their support for the event. While there, we were presented with a moving performance by a full band that rocked the house, singing worship songs in both Hindi and English, followed by a movie that Keith D&rsquo;souza, our good friend, tour guide, and founder of Crossover had made personally. Next, after the much deserved applause, speeches ensued giving personal honor to the staff of Crossover and all hard work they have done putting their countless hours in for the sake of the girls being rescued.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>This whole trip, Keith his wife Ramona have watched out for us and been there in every time of need, it was wonderful to see different people from different organizations pay homage to these two absolutely deserving people. Overall the day was pretty easy for us, but at the same time, I feel that it was absolutely necessary for us to somehow give back a small bit of thanks as a whole. The ceremony was moving, and all that I can say and take away from everything, is my hope that at least one person takes away a new found awareness of the human trafficking problem and is motivated enough to make a change in their life to step out and help wherever they can.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>We all sit on the outdoor patio, drinking our cold drinks, and laughing in each other&rsquo;s company. Tomorrow looms ahead of us, and it has come too fast. Though we all miss you back home, and know you all miss us (thanks so much for the comments), I know that we&rsquo;re all going to be sad to leave such a chaotic place behind.</em></p>
