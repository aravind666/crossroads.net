<p>Obedience More Important Than Sacrifice</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, open my ears and help me to hear your voiceclearly.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2015:1-22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 15:1-22</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br></strong>God told Saul to completely destroy the Amalekites. He didnt say, Destroy most of them,but save the king if you think hes a nice guy... maybe a sheep or two. I dont know,Saul... set up a shrine or something... just use your own judgement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God grieved because Saul did not completely obey. He started out on the right foot, butsomewhere along the way, he began mixing his own way in with Gods way. It didntmatter that he was saving the best animals for sacrifice. That was not part of the deal.God wants us to obey completely. Selective listening is not obedience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God wants us to listen to his voice and to follow through on his direction. Hes notimpressed by how much we sacrifice; Hes pleased by our obedience.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Do you have any areas in your life where you are selectively listening to God? HasGod given you instruction and somewhere along the way, you worked in your own plan?Ask God to open your eyes to these places. And listen to Him.</p>
