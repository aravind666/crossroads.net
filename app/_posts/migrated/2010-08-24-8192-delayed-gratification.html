<p>Delayed Gratification</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to give you patience as you wait upon him to fulfill his promises.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2011:8-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:8-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Most of us dont deal too well with delayed gratification; the thought of waiting for weeks or months for something to happen is generally beyond us. (Even waiting for the microwave to wind down the last five seconds can feel like a stretch.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet as the writer of Hebrews describes, sometimes the promises of God can leave us waiting a lifetime. In the case of Abraham, he died without receiving all that God had promisedyet remained faithful. Why? Because he knew that the promises of God were not limited to this life alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about the idea that some of Gods promises may not be fulfilled in your life?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the Bible, God makes it very clear that faithfulness is not a solo sportwe need community around us to encourage and support us in our journey. Take a few minutes to think about the people in your life who encourage you to remain faithful, then write short thank-you note to one of them (or several, if you like!).</p>
