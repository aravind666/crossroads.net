<p>Do Not Worry</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to meet with you today. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%206:25-27&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 6:25-27</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Weve read these verses a few times over the past several weeks. Theyre significant because they are direct commands from Jesus that we shouldnt worry about where our provision will come from, but instead we are to trust in God to provide for our needs. Do you believe that God will provide for you? Really?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reinforce his role as provider in your life, and to help you trust that he will take care of you.</p>
