<p>A Staggering Act</p>
<p></p>
<p>God, allow me to see the depth of your character as I spend time with you today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway Matthew 27:27-56" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027:27-56&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 27:27-56</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If you sit quietly with this scripture for a while (even if youre really familiar with the events of what happened), youll most likely find something astonishing, or feel something new stir up in you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A gang of brutal soldiers. The Place of the Skull. Grotesque insults and torture. And then after Jesus final breath: a revered curtain splits apart, bodies of holy people come back to life, the earth shakes and storms. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This incredible day reveals the passion of our Godthe unsurpassed love he has for us. Nowhere else in all of human history or religion is there any concept of a god who would suffer, die and live like this for his creation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the God we follow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>In the face of such a staggering act, one of the most fitting responses is gratitude. Spend a few minutes today thanking Jesus in whatever way you like.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 26" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026&amp;version=NIV">Acts 26</a></p>
