<span class="postbody">CINCINNATI (Dec. 17, 2008)- "At approximately 7:30
p.m. on December 17, a cast member from the Awaited Christmas show fell
from a suspended position during the performance. She was attended to
by emergency medical personnel as quickly as possible and then
transferred to a local hospital for medical attention. We do not have
an update on her condition at this time, but she is receiving the best
possible medical treatment available. <br><br>
Our first concern is for this cast member and her family. We are not
releasing her name to protect her privacy. We ask that you pray for her
quick recovery and that God will heal her completely.
<br><br>At this time, we have not made any decisions about the remaining
performances. We will take care to respect this cast member and her
family in any decision that we make regarding upcoming shows. <br><br>
Again, we ask for your prayers for the cast member and her family. 
<br>

<br>
We will provide more information as it becomes available."<br><br></span><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">In the
meantime, out of respect for those involved please refrain from sharing
individual accounts of the incident, however we encourage you to post
your prayers and words of encouragement.</span></span>
