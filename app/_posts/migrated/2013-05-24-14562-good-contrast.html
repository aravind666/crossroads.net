<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good?: Contrast</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday there was a long list in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:19-21&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:19-21</a> about what life looks like when we separate God from certain areas of our life. Today, the following verses show us the picture of an integrated life.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:22&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:22- 23</a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we give God all of the areas of our life (which seems wise since he is all-knowing anyway) he knows everything about us (even what we try to hide). He also knows everything about everything (which means that he is the wisest advisor). If that isnt enough motivation, the list of goodness that is poured out in this verse makes it clear what is waiting for us long-term.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Of all of the statements listed in the verse today, which enticed you the most? Journal about how it contrasts with what you listed yesterday, or just about it in general.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 4</a></p>
