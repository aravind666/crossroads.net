<p>For Those Who Have Ears</p>
<p><br><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%208:4-15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 8:4-15</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This parable seems pretty straightforward when you first read it. Farmer plants seed, seed falls on different kinds of soil, which in turn produces different results. Not too surprising, even if we recognize that there is a spiritual application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But then theres this phrase: He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Which sounds like, If you get it, you get it. If not, oh well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its one thing for Jesus to say that some people wont accept his message; thats just being realistic. But He goes beyond that. Remember, He doesnt explain the parable to the whole audience, just to the disciples.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just to those who pursued, who sought, who were fertile soil. Just to those who had ears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you bothered by the idea that Jesus didnt offer an explanation to everyone? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you have ears to hear? In what ways are you pursuing Jesus teaching?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Read back through the parable again. Its possible that you have been all of these soils at various points in your life. Take a few moments to identify times when you have been in these different stages, then ask Jesus to help you understand how to be fertile soil in your daily life.</p>
