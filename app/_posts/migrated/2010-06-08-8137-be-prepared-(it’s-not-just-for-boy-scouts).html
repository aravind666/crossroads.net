<p>Be Prepared (Its Not Just for Boy Scouts)</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2025:1-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 25:1-13</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Extra oil for the lamps? Why would we need that? Since when do weddings ever run late?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just like Jesus listeners, we can understand the foolishness of not being completely prepared for something as important as a wedding. For an event as significant as this, you take every precaution and check every detail. Especially something as simple as having enough oil for your lamp. It would be like running out of gas on your way there. Youd never live it down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet God has invited us to take part in His kingdomthe earthly phase of which could end at any moment. Each day we have is precious, and not being prepared for what God wants to accomplish through us is even more foolish than forgetting the oil for your lamp.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about the idea that God could step in and end things at any moment?</li>
<li>What is one way you can be more prepared for the opportunities God sets before you?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When we think about what God wants me to do, our tendency is to lean toward big, life-changing things like Move to a third-world country or Give away everything I own. Yet Jesus example was as simple as going to the store and buying more oil for a lamp. Spend some time asking God to tell you simple ways you can be more prepared for how He wants to impact the world around you.</p>
