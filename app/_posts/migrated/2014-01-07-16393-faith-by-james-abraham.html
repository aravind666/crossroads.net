<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to increase your understanding of how he wants to move in your life, today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james%202:21-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:21-24</a>; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022:9-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 22:9-12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">His faith was made complete, James says, when Abraham followed through. His words---the things he said to his friends, to God, even to himself---those words became real and actionable. Instead of just saying, I believe in God, he made an incredible move: he got his son ready to be sacrificed. He didnt withhold the best part of his life; he was willing to give God everything. In his willingness, his faith was made complete.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, let your yes be yes and your no be a true no. The things you promise to do? Do them. Said you wont? Then dont. Practice matching your words with your actions.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 3</a></p>
