<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodnews: Getting Low</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will explore a story from the book of John as we look at how Jesus interacts with us in truth and grace through our sexual mistakes.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:2-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 8:2-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The religious law keepers want to accuse. The woman who has been caught (notice no man is brought with her) is there with her dirty laundry swaying in the breeze, right in front of those who will condemn most harshly. Worst of all, the religious have used her as a pawn, just another type of objectification. Wow--no one would want to be her. We will continue this week to look at how Jesus responds. He begins by bending down, getting low and writing in the dust.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Picture yourself brought before Jesus, a person who knows you and your whole life. What do you think or feel that he would say to you? Write about it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%207&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 7</a></p>
