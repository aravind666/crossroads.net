<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>STEPHENS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When I went to college to study science, I was confronted with questions about my faith. I woke up one morning and realized that I didnt actually believe it anymore. I had no evidence of God and I had probably wasted a lot of my life in church. This was traumatic.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Searching for the truth, I studied other religions. I became a Zen Buddhist. But when my mother died, I found no comfort in Zen. I asked God almost daily to prove himself to meto take me to lunch. He never answered. At least I had science as a way to cope.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God does things differently. Years later, I met Bernadette. Shes a scientist like me and offered to talk with me about God. When I attended church with her the message was that evidence for God comes from within ourselves, not from out in the world. Im not going to find God in DNA, I am going to find him in my heart. I spoke directly to God and said, If you exist, you dont have to prove yourself to me. Im going to try it your way and if you decide to speak to me, I will listen. Almost as soon as the words were out of my mouth I was brought to my knees. In my gut I heard, "I never left you" and tears began to stream down my face.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When I shared this with Bernadette over lunch she told me she had posted a verse from Deuteronomy that said I am the Lord your God and I will never leave you or forsake you. I sat there across the table and realized that God had just taken me to lunch.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Stephens lunch with God reminds us that he is always with us, just like it says in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2031:6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>. All we need is to receive Him.</p>
