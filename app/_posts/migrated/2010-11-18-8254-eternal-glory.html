<p>Eternal Glory</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to make you strong through his word today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Peter%205:8-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 5:8-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The initiatives God has called our community to pursue will require strength and endurance. And make no mistake about it: we have an enemy who will oppose us. Yet, God himself promises to make us strong so that we can endure and ultimately experience victory in him. This victory is just a small taste of the ultimate prize, which Peter describes as eternal glory in Christ.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Today, ask God to remind you of the ultimate prize of being faithfully committed to him.</p>
