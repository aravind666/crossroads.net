<p class="noPspace">This week, were learning about Gods faithfulness. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God, help me rely on you every day; turn my dependence on you into a daily habit. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%205:3&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 5:3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">So whats the bottom line when it comes to understanding Gods faithfulness? Its simply depending on Him more than anything else in our lives--money, status, jobs, friends or even family. Jesus very first words from this section of the book of Matthew known as the Sermon on the Mount were "blessed are the poor in spirit." In other words, youre on the right track when you wake up every morning, admit that youre spiritually broke, and depend on Gods faithfulness to sustain you throughout the day. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">As you head into the weekend, think about one specific action you can take to lean into Gods faithfulness over the next couple days. This could be as big as choosing to believe God is bigger than that recent medical diagnosis, or as small as not worrying about your Saturday night plans.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Thessalonians 4</a></p>
