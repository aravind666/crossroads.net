<p class="noPspace">There is plenty of encouraging news coming from our partners in India. Those on the ground report strong volunteer engagement, positive connections with legal representatives, new bonds formed with churches in India and most importantly, growth and healing for the girls in the aftercare and transition homes. If you’ve been following the trip blog posts, you know that 700 church pastors, key leaders, influential people and youth attended the “RESTORE – RENEW – REINSTATE” human trafficking event on April 27 in Mumbai. GO India trip participants from Crossroads were there as well, and one of the highlights was Keith and Ramona D’Souza’s documentary filmed in a brothel (read more about it in <a href="/blog/view/5/11385">our April 27 blog entry</a>).  </p>
<p class="noPspace"> <br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">There’s also some great news here in the U.S. Last month, the IJM Base Camp Summit and church partner conference was held in Washington, D.C.  Led by Crossroads, 121 Church (Grapevine, TX), Cornerstone (San Francisco, CA) and Discovery (Orlando, FL), the conference helped 30 churches learn how to take their community’s heart for justice initiatives to the next level. Many said the conference was a big encouragement and left ready to weave their passion for justice into the DNA of their respective churches. Representatives from Crossroads (including Don Gerred, Brian Wells and Jamie Elkins) also developed relationships with churches that may choose to partner with us in our work in India. Finding church communities like ours to help invest finances and volunteer effort is critical to multiplying the work that’s being done.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>Here are some additional updates from our aftercare and transition home partners, Crossover Foundation and IJM.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Updates:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In March, two girls rescued from South Mumbai brothels last year testified in court. One was very sick and traveled a long distance to testify, but gave effective and moving testimony. </em></li>
<li><em>A young woman rehabilitating in the Mahima transition home in Kolkata, who was rescued from a particularly brutal brothel—numerous beatings and cigarettes burns left her body scarred—stood bravely, spoke courageously and faced her oppressor in court.  </em></li>
<li><em>Over 40 lawyers from Mumbai attended an IJM lawyers’ conference held in partnership with the Christian Lawyer’s Association in April. The conference was successful, and many asked how to support the work being done. The hope is that the connections made through this conference will open up many new doors in IJM-Mumbai’s casework, and spread a message of political will to the community.</em></li>
<li><em>Programs in cosmetology, bag making, life skills and basic educational training have been successfully started in seven Mumbai aftercare homes, impacting 400 survivors. Work continues on programs in individual and group counseling services, life skills training, vocational training, and art and dance therapy. </em></li>
<li><em>Two young women from the Mahima transition home in Kolkata are beginning full-time work as trainees at a local social enterprise in May. </em></li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">In the book of Matthew, we read about the ways Jesus spent time teaching and sharing the good news everywhere he went. In Matthew 9:36-38, Jesus lets his followers know that someday they will have to follow his lead and take over the work he started. “When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.<sup> </sup>Then he said to his disciples, ‘The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.’” When people from Crossroads first decided to get involved in fighting the forced sex trade in India, the workers were few. Today, thanks to a lot of prayer, divine providence and hearts answering the call to fight, the workers are more plentiful, and we are beginning to make a difference in the lives of girls rescued from the sex trafficking trade.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Turning the tide in India will take a lot more effort, and while we’re encouraged by the updates from our partners, the road ahead is still long and difficult.  But we’ll keep venturing into the harvest field and asking for God’s guidance as we continue doing His work.</p>
