<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Good Beginnings: United</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, we continue looking at Gods good creation of man and woman in Genesis.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:24&amp;version=NLT">Genesis 2:24</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In Genesis 1, God blessed mankind to be fruitful and multiply, but this verse is really the beginning of sex and marriage. Woman was taken out of man, and sex brings the image of God (masculine and feminine), back together again. This means that the covenant created through sex is stronger than the bond created through being birthed by our own mother. Birthing a child and raising that child is a holy thing. The covenant of sex is even stronger.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do you view sex as this powerful of a bond? Journal today about how you have valued or undervalued the covenant of sex.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2028&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 28</a></p>
