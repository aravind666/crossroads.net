<p class="noPspace">Our last post featured the story of justice-seeker Jamie Elkins. Here is the story of another woman from Crossroads working for justice, Shannon Constable.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shannons Story</strong></span></p>
<p class="noPspace">Shannon started her justice journey in 2006 while she was at the University of Cincinnati. She volunteered to work in India with an organization called <a href="http://www.coindia.org/">Cooperative Outreach of India</a> (COI), which empowers women from marginalized areas with education to help provide for their families. When she returned to Cincinnati, Shannon did everything she could to spread the word about the injustices she had witnessed in India, including the development of an IJM Campus Chapter at the University of Cincinnati. It was not long after her graduation that Shannon was made aware of the open position at IJM (left when Jamie joined Crossover Foundation). With the support of her friends, family and a very vivid dream, she felt the calling to go back to India. I dont think God has really spoken to me often in my dreams, but I really do feel like he was speaking to me at that point. So Shannon applied, and two weeks later, she was offered the position and moved to India in March 2011.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Through her work with IJM, Shannon was exposed to the brutal realities of trafficking in India. She was reminded of Gods love for each one of these girls and women traffickedand even those who had become brothel managers, and was even more convicted of the need to break the cycle for them and their families. She also had the chance to work closely with local churches. Seeing a church go from not knowing anything about human trafficking to starting an aftercare home is incredible. I could see Gods hand at work through every step of that process.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Shannons message of encouragement is similar to that of Jamiesthat the best way to step out of the boat is by simply listening. I would say just be aware of what others say to you, what you feel inclined to do. Maybe you feel called to get involved with the justice team or with poverty issues in Cincinnati. Whatever it may be, it could definitely be from God.</p>
