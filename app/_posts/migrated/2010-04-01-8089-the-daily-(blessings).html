<p><strong>Thursday, April 1</strong></p>
<p>Blessings</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:13</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Peter%202:16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 2:16</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God's heart for us is freedom, but that doesnt mean complete independence. Freedom is only found when we are tethered to God. It is false freedom to think that "anything goes" or that whatever feels good is good. We must continue to depend on Jesus for our freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Thank God for the freedom he has given you and ask him to reveal any areas of false freedom in your life.</p>
