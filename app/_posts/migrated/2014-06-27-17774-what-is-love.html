<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What is Love?</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were redefining the words happiness, wealth, family and love. All this week were going to receive Gods love for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to remind you of his love.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 John 4:7-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve made love a really squishy word. We think its a synonym for romance, friendly and generous. Theres definitely some love associated with these words, but love is actually something we experience and can share with others when we know who God is. This week, were going to explore all the ways we know that God loves us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In 1 John, we read that because God loves us, we should love others. Today, share the love with a family member, a friend or coworker.</p>
