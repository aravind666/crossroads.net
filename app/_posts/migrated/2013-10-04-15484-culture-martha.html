<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>#Culture: Martha</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week were looking at being undistracted, present and waiting at Jesus feet. Well find this through reading the story of Mary and Martha. #Marthasetsanicetable</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:38-42&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:38-42</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Martha is hospitable and ready to host Jesus when he comes to town because shes been faithful in caring for her home and having it prepared. Way to go Martha! (Martha Stewart has nothing on you.) Yet, when Jesus arrives, she continues to be busy. The God of the universe has come to your house in the flesh--as much as Martha has to offer, its time for her to shut that off and switch to receive mode.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make a list right now of all the things you want to get done today. Now pray over your list and ask God to make you present through your day.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2014&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 14</a></p>
