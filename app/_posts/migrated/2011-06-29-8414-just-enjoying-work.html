<p>Just Enjoying Work</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, replace my worries with contentment in the work youve set before me. Help me find joy and satisfaction in my work.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%205:%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Solomon, said to have been the wisest man ever to have lived, built a huge fortune for himself as King of Israel. Yet he began to realize somethingjust having stuff wasnt enough. The more you have, the more you must protect. Or, as Biggie Smalls said, Mo money, mo problems. When we lean less into God and more into hoarding, we may think all of that worrying helps protect our stuff. But we are robbed, nonetheless; robbed of our sleep, our contentment, and our joy, to name a few.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hard work brings a blessing of satisfaction. We can miss this fact by being distracted with thoughts that the work were doing is beneath us or unimportant. But any work God has laid before us is his work. Solomon realized that working just to work can be enjoyable because there is satisfaction in a job well done. Reclaim work by enjoying the work itself, not what the work brings you. Receive the pleasure and joy from the toilet you cleaned or the report you filed. And enjoy the sweet sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>As you go to sleep tonight, reflect on your work. Dont fret over what you didnt do, but rather reflect on what you did do. Enjoy the satisfaction that comes with knowing you did work.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT </strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 6</a></p>
