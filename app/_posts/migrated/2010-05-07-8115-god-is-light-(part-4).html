<p>God is Light (Part 4)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study his nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2060:1-5&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 60:1-5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If we are in relationship with God, and God is light, then what does that mean for us?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider this: when the electrical power fails and our neighborhoods are in darkness, what happens? Light has a natural attraction. Light is a powerful force. People in darkness are drawn to light. They search for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why our relationship with God is so powerful. Just like the moon reflects the light of the sun, so we, too, can reflect Gods light.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about a time when things were dark for you. Who or what was the light that gave you hope?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>As you draw closer to God, his image is revealed to others through you. Ask God to clear the things in your life that hinder his reflection from you to others.</p>
<p></p>
