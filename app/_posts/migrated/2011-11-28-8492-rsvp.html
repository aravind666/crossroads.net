<p><strong>Monday, November 28</strong></p>
<p>RSVP</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Ask God to show you what it means to receive him as an invitation.</em></p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108836066948&amp;s=0&amp;e=001BGj_aKs8NRdKQSQ3lJDZcSBg172ntMKz6M5dcBZkQShowtGHntutyhadsPhx8r7eBv54KCLUIZ9zQhTay4UWUHcQMfPw1L4wH6y7bUlL2XO5hj6pG76mhfbjfTCtMBX6pz4yWd1wV3TzOlY5nF2SywXgMZ0Natasvba3_OCbgg_efPlSdu5Lz_lziE2gCwIfJk0Rfgn9iA_M6rA8h7rrRA==" target="_blank">John 1:14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Think  about an invitation you really want-an exclusive event, a degree  program, the Senior PGA Tour. If you get it, youre elated and cant  wait to go. Compare that response to getting called for jury duty or  into a mandatory meeting. Night and day difference, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>As  outrageous as it is that God became a man, it makes sense that Jesus  would come to us as an invitation, not a summons. He came for us to  choose him, because getting the choice to follow and love someone leads  to a strong and active relationship. Otherwise, its a relationship  burdened with things like obligation, guilt, fear or ritual.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For  the next three weeks, well consider what it means to get invited into  relationship with Jesus and what happens when we show up at the party.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Whether  youre a new follower of Jesus or twenty years in the making, you might  waver back and forth between feeling both invited and summoned into  relationship with Jesus. How have you been experiencing Him recently?</p>
<p></p>
