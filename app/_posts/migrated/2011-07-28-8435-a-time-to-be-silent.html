<p>A Time to Be Silent</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, give me discernment to know when to speak and when to be quiet.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God  is about to do something very big-part the Red Sea and rescue the  Israelites. But the Israelites are terrified and oblivious. Nothing  coming out of their mouths is helpful. In fact, they are blurting out so  much fear and anger, they could very well be messing up the miracle  thats about to happen! In verse 14, Moses is firm and clear, "The  Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still." And The Message  translation of this verse is even more direct: "God will fight the  battle for you. And you? You keep your mouths shut!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes  the kindest, most loving thing God can do is to give us someone who is  willing to look us in the face and tell us to shut it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>The  Bible tells us there is a time for everything, including "a time to be  silent and a time to speak." These moments arent determined by our mood  or whether or not we think we have something to say. Rather, we listen  to the Holy Spirit and, in faith, we do what we think he is saying.  Today, practice asking God to guide you through every sentence. Whether  its at work, at home or with friends, err on the side of silence until  you feel He wants you speak. Treat this assignment as an experiment and  record your findings.</p>
