<p>Embracing the tension of perspective</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%207:1-14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 7:1-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This passage in Ecclesiastes seems at first to be pretty negative; almost an anti-poem to Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. But reconsider the final verse of todays reading:</p>
<p></p>
<p>"In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; God has made the one as well as the other, so that mortals may not find out anything that will come after them."</p>
<p></p>
<p>With that in mind, the passage takes on a different meaning: its less about pointing out the hardships in life than it is a reminder that theres far more to Gods plan than we can comprehend. The pain and adversity we encounter, if we embrace them as part of that plan, serve as reminders that were part of something much, much greater.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If someone asked you, "whats the most important life-lesson youve ever learned," what would you say? Make note of your answer, and then think about where you learned that lesson: did it come from a time of adversity? Did you realize the importance of the lesson at the time you were learning it? What does that experience tell you about how God sometimes works in our lives?</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12</a></p>
