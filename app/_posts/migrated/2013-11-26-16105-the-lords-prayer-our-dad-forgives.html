<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>NICOLES STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I have two sisters, Hollie and Robin. Robin is an addict and has been in and out of treatment, jail and as a result in and out of our lives. She has caused us a lot of pain. She was arrested this summer and I was done with her. We found out a couple of weeks ago that she would probably be getting out of jail sometime in November. My husband, Richard, said we should let her stay with us. I told him it was not a good idea.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For me, the journey had a consistent theme: forgiveness and trusting God. I admit, I am not one that is easy to forgive and while I trust that God will provide for me, I have a hard time keeping that in my mind. During the journey I picked the "Let It Go" card. My other sister Hollie picked the same card in her small group. Coincidence? I think not. Hollie and I agreed this was God calling us to forgive Robin. She said that we needed to pour love and forgiveness into her like we had never done before and we should invite her to move in with one of us. I said to her, "OK, now you are freaking me out. Richard said the same thing." </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We talked to Robin and told her about the cards, the journey and then I offered to let her stay with me. She was overcome with emotion and gratitude. She said the entire time she was in jail she prayed we would find forgiveness in our hearts. Robin agreed to move in with us and I am hopeful this is the beginning of a new relationship and she can finally put her demons behind her. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our Dad lays out a path to follow in his Kingdom. Sometimes we forget and we stray away onto others paths and take what isnt ours. But our Dad freely forgives us and in this verse of the prayer, we ask him to help us stay on the path. When other people cross over and hurt us, we forgive them just as God has forgiven us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Give thanks today for a Father who freely gives grace and look for a way you can forgive someone across the table.</p>
