<p class="noPspace">Good day folks,</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Tonight we are pooped.  I think the events and emotions of the week are catching up with us. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Today we visited two different aftercare homes (we split the group in two) and got to interact with the girls at the focal point of Crossroads work in India (the focal point, not including the Man Upstairs of course).  This is my third trip where I was able to interact with the girls, and it was by far the least amount of time we ever spent with the girls.  Selfishly, I want to spend all week with them......but I know it’s healthiest for them if that is not the case. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">The team I was with coordinated some different arts and crafts for the girls (one including a fingerprint exercise to remind them that they are unique and loved by many.  Then we catered in pizza for lunch and finished with 50 tubes of henna tattoos, and the markings to prove it! </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Today was a confirmation of why we are here.......why we are working so hard to build relationships with the Indian Church, why we are sending folks 9000 miles away to a crazy different culture.  It’s for the girls.  And today was impactful and hopeful for us all. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Tomorrow we will be heading to two different ’daycare’ centers with a few of our pastor friends from early in the week.  I’ve been told this will be one of the more challenging things we will see this week as most of the children come from a rough background.  I know our team will be strong, and do great........but if you’d like to pray for us, we’d appreciate it!  Pray that we see the light through the darkness and that our visit will bring a little bit of joy to those children we’ll be interacting with.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">On a side note, we went to a mall this evening to grab dinner after our busy day and Chris Sutton (our worship leader on the trip from Crossroads) was approached and asked to sing a Coldplay karaoke song on this stage in the middle of the mall.  Within 30 seconds the mall went from an average ho-hum Wednesday night.......to this picture below.  I’m pretty sure they thought he was some sort of star.......it was hilarious!</p>
