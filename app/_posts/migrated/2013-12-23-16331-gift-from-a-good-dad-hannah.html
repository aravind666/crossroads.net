<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>HANNAHS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I went through a dark period where I had not felt home in over a year. I moved three times and I was desperately searching for a home environment that would nourish my weary soul.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I knew God wanted me to feel at home but I wasnt sure what that looked like until I confided in a friend. She pointed me into the direction of other single women who wanted the same things. I believed in Gods promise as a good father, so I took the risk and moved in with people I had never even met before.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Turns out, it was the best decision I have ever made and a concrete example of how God always follows through on his promises---it just may not look like how we expect it to or in the timeframe that we want. Now, I feel more at home, authentic and free than I ever have.</p>
