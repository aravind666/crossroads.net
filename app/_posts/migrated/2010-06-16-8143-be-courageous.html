<p><strong>Wednesday, June 16 </strong><br> Be Courageous</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes talking to God about whats been going on in your daily life.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Daniel%206:16-23&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Daniel 6:16-23<br><br><br></a></p>
<p><strong>REFLEC</strong>T</p>
<p>Often we look at men and women who seem adventurous and wonder how they possess the courage to do what they do. Whether its jumping out of plane or skiing down a mountain, we often aspire to the fearlessness celebrated in our culture. But a look at Daniels story reveals a different kind of courage in the face of intense adversity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unafraid of the consequences, Daniel obeyed God and worshipped only him. Because of his countercultural behavior, dishonest men threw him into a den of lions. But when the miraculous happened and his life was spared, Daniel wasnt interested in his own glory. His courage came from trusting God with his life, and come what may, he rested in the promise that he was Gods and had nothing to fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to fill you with the level of courage Daniel had, based on an unfailing trust in Him. Invite the Holy Spirit to reveal any areas of your life where you dont trust him yet, whether thats in relationships, work or provisions. Could any of these areas be holding you back from pursuing an adventure God has for you?</p>
