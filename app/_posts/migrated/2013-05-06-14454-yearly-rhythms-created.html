<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Yearly Rhythms: Created</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will look at the yearly Holy days (or holidays) set in place by God in the Old Testament. They were yearly reminders for Gods people of his character and elements of their relationship with him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">From the beginning, Gods plan was to give rest once per week through Sabbath, and to give rhythms of holidays throughout the year. The stars and seasons were put in place by God to help form yearly reminders and markers in our lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There are four holidays that we will look at this week that are sacred holidays given to the Jewish people of the Old testament. These four point toward the character of God and are powerful to remember on a yearly basis. Well look at--deliverance, covenant, repentance and home.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make a list today of holidays or yearly rhythms that you have in your life, and put a word next to each about what you experience through that yearly rhythm.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
