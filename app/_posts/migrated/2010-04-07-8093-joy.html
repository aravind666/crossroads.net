<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%208:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:15</a><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Joy and fear cannot co-habitate.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><br>The Bible tells us, There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love (1 John 4:18). We cant experience true joy when were looking over our shoulders, expecting God to cause pain or make us feel worthless. Gods love for us is perfect, with no punishments attached.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><br>We can experience and reflect joy because we are so perfectly loved.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Is there any part of your life where you used to have fear or stress, and are now joyful? Take a minute and celebrate that. <strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
