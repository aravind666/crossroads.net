<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Wednesday, December 2</strong><br>Old vs. New<br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 4:17-24<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Light vs. Darkness: its the timeless struggle woven through every great story. Good vs. Evil. The Hero vs. the Villain. The Bengals vs. the Steelers. <br><br>Regardless of the context, there are competing realities in this world that battle for our allegiance. Todays passage paints a contrast between living in darkness (life apart from God) and living in the light (life connected to God). <br><br>As we receive Jesus and submit to his teaching, we are increasingly able to put off our old self and put on our new self. Think of the old self as any thought or behavioral pattern that doesnt line up with Gods truth. The new self reflects the thoughts and behavioral patterns that connect us with Gods heart. <br></p>
<ul><li>Read verses 18-19 again. Do you think these statements are true about everyone living apart from relationship with God, or just certain people? Why? </li></ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Take a sheet of paper (or turn to a fresh page in your journal) and draw a line down the center. On the left side write old self as a heading and on the right side write new self as a heading. Ask God to help you see any old thoughts and behaviors that hes asking you to put off, and write them down as he brings them to your mind. Then ask God to show you new thoughts and behaviors to put on in place of the old. <br><br>This exercise just gives you a snapshot of the areas in your life where God will grow you over time. Your role is simply to be open to the ongoing truth God wants to show you.</body></html>
