<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Work with Purpose</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were talking about how to work like a BOSS. This week, well look at the book of Colossians and its wise words on working.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you work with dignity and purpose.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:3-4&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Colossians 1:3-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Book of Colossians was originally a letter that the apostle Paul wrote to Christ-followers in the town of Colosse. He began by encouraging the Colossians, and celebrating the purpose behind their faith.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">All of us desire a purposeful life, to believe that there is meaning to what we do and contribute. Like the Colossians, may purpose in our lives never grow slack while we keep our focus and hope on God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about areas of your life where you are experiencing purpose and fruit. How can you focus your energy towards fruitful things, not just putting out fires?</p>
