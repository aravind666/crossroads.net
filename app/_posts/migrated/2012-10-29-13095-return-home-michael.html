<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET MICHAEL</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"I was at Crossroads one Sunday morning after a night of partying, feeling terrible because of guilt and a massive hangover. This was during a time when I was making a turn away from an old life and putting on a new life in Christ, but regularly failing miserably at being good. I sat as thousands of people stood singing a refrain, "all I want is you," thinking,God I cant sing this to you, it simply isnt true, youre obviously not all I want.In that instant, to my shocking surprise, I heard God say to me, "I brought you here and orchestrated all these people to sing this song from ME to YOU...all I want is YOU!" I was absolutely crushed by His love and overcome, sitting there weeping as I was completely wrapped in the arms of my Father. I had never felt so loved and at home as God tangibly loved me, as people continued to sing Gods heart to me, "All I want is you..."."</p>
