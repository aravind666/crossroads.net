<p>If you’re processing   something for which you’d like to receive prayer, you’re invited to sign   up for a 45 minute session of reflective listening and focused prayer. During this time, two trained members of our Prayer Team will listen to your need and then pray with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In  February we will offer Listening and Prayer on Thursday nights and  Friday mornings. Please call Susan at 513.731.7400 x380 to make an appointment.</p>
