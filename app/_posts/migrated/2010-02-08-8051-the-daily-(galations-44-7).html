<p><strong>Monday, February 8</strong><br>Heirs<br><em><br>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%204:4-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"><br>Galatians 4:4-7</a><br>(Click to view the scripture online.)<br><br></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Any parent knows how hard it can be to say no to your children. No matter how strong you try to be, the impulse to want to bless your kids and give them joy is powerful. Although many times no is the right response, its always a great feeling to say yes when you know its the right thing and to see the joy that results.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that those who follow Jesus are sons of God, and that as sons we have received the full rights of inheritance. Some of these rights include Gods forgiveness, Gods Spirit inside of us, and the ability to hear from him when we pray. We are heirs, and God wants to give us the full blessings that accompany our relationship with him.</p>
<p>Weve all heard stories of the rich kids who blew their inheritance. The only thing worse is ignoring the inheritance altogether.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whats an area where you arent taking advantage of your inheritance from God? (Remember, this includes His forgiveness, his Spirit, and the ability to hear from him when we pray, among other ways that God blesses us.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How can you start fully receiving Gods blessing instead?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Take a minute to thank God that through Jesus hes given you everything that he is capable of giving. Then ask Him to help you maximize the inheritance hes given you.</p>
