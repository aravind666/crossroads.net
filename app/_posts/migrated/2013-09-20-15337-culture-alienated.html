<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Culture: Alienated</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we will parse out a section of verses in Ephesians 4 that look at the difference between the culture that is all around us versus the culture of Jesus. Well add a verse (or two) each day.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4:18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God created every element of this planet--rocks, trees, biological cycles and even you. Meanwhile, the enemy has territory here, and his entire goal, just like the snake in the garden, is to deceive us into believing his systems and cultures are the best way to function on this planet (that he is just a squatter in). Without Christ, we are all the They at the beginning of this verse. We have a sense of feeling alienated, and the root is our own hard hearts.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2011:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Ezekiel 11:19</a> and picture exactly what happens in this verse. Imagine God giving you a new heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Luke 4</a></p>
