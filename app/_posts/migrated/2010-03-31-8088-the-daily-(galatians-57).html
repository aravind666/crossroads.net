<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:7</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We should take care to build relationships in our lives with people who encourage our freedom and show us grace in the process. Sometimes we get off track because were hanging around people who are primarily concerned with what they can get from us, or who resist any changes we make. Be aware of these people who ungrace you. And look to the freedom encouragers, instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you the freedom fighters in your life.</p>
<p></p>
