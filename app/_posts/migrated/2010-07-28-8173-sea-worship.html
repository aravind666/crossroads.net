<p>Sea Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Chronicles%2016:32-34&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Chronicles 16:32-34</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Theres a childrens book called The Snail and the Whale. Its the story of an adventurous snail that hitches a ride on the tail of a whale, and sets off for adventures around the world. In one of the passages in the book, the snail echoes the sentiments of probably everyones first encounter of the ocean:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And she gazed at the sky, the sea, the land,</p>
<p>The waves and the caves and the golden sand,</p>
<p>She gazed and gazed, amazed by it all,</p>
<p>And she said to the whale, I feel so small.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever felt that way while standing at the edge of the ocean? The vastness of it all, the waves breaking over the reef, the salt water air spraying around you. What an opportunity to worship! Imagine it: the one who created the seas and the forests, the valleys and the mountains, also created you and me, and loves us enough to know us by name. Its beyond comprehension that above all created things, God values relationship with us. That fact alone is enough to make one heck of a worship service right there on the beach.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take some time today to respond to the world around you. Whether its at the ocean, at the community pool, or simply walking from your office to your car, pause long enough to see the beauty and vastness of the world surrounding you. Give glory to God for creating such beauty, and for knowing your name in the midst of it.</p>
