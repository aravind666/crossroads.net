Groups of volunteers and friends from Crossroads are going together to the Cincinnati Reds game on Thursday, May 7, at 7:10pm. Come and watch the Reds take on the Milwaukee Brewers. It's early enough in the season that the Reds still might be good. In order to get tickets sitting together (a variety of price ranges are available), <a href="../images/uploadedImages/Reds Game 2009.pdf" title="Reds flyer">you must purchase tickets in advance.</a>
