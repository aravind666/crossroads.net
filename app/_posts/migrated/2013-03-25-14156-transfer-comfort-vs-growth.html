<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do you invest toward comfort or growth in your life? Every moment of our life we have the opportunity to choose, and spiritual battles are won and lost in those daily choices (by the way, fasting is a frontline spiritual battle.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do you come home from work or school and plunk down on the couch for some tv, video game, snack, or facebook time? Do you choose to pacify your addictions, cravings or comforts or do you pursue opportunities to learn and expand your mind? Beans and rice fast (or any time that we choose something hard over the everyday easy) is a chance to choose growth over comfort. Today, when you feel frustrated-- choose growth, its where all the good fruit is.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a moment today to journal about where you get your comfort. Ask God to be your comfort and show you how he wants to grow you.</p>
