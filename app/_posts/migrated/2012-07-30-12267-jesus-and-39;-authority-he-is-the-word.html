<p class="noPspace"><strong>Jesus Authority: He is the Word</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Yesterday we read that Jesus words hold authority. Today, read how John conveys that Jesusisthe Word.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><a href=""></a><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:1-3&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">John 1:1-3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>John used the words In the Beginning as an obvious tie back to the beginning of Gods story in Genesis. God spoke, and thats it--everything came into existence. John poetically linked that Jesus embodied that creative power in the flesh. The authority of Gods word that created the world is not onlyinJesus, itwasJesus. That same Jesus is still alive and powerful.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Do you have a polite relationship with faith or Jesus? Picture, right now, what your life might look like if you believed that Jesus had authority and power to impact your life today.</p>
