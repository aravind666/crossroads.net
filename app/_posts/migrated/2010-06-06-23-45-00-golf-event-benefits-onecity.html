<p>It&rsquo;s not too late to participate in the OneCity Pro-Am Golf Event from  June 26-28, either as a volunteer, golfer or hole sponsor. The  tournament benefits the OneCity Foundation, a key ReachOut partner. More  than $1 million has gone towards changing lives in Cincinnati since  Brad and Colleen Johansen organized the event five years ago.
