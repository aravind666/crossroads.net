<p><strong>Thursday, January 28</strong><br>To whom is God Sending You? <br><br><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Galatians 2:6-9<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Jesus handpicked two menPaul (the transformed, ex-Pharisee) and Peter (a fisherman)to go out into the world and tell people about the love and freedom he offers. Paul refers to himself and Peter as apostles, a Greek word meaning one who is sent. Paul was sent to share Jesus message with the Gentiles (anyone who wasnt Jewish), and Peters mission was to share the message with Jews. Different missions, different styles, same message.<br><br>The people around usfamily, friends, coworkersneed this same message of freedom. And while Jesus doesnt send all of us to other countries or on a crazy mission, he does call each of us to help the people around us experience his love and hope.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a person who influenced the beginning of your relationship with Jesus. What impact did they have?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask Jesus to direct you to one person in your life who needs his love and freedom. Take whatever action you sense Jesus leading you towards. This doesnt mean you have to corner them at the water cooler and try to convert them. It could be lunch, a phone call, or a simple gesture of kindness. The important part is being open and obedient to however Jesus leads you.<br><br><strong><br>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Matthew 28:16-20</p>
