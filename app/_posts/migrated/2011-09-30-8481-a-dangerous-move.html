<p>A Dangerous Move</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to pray: "God, please help me to move in spite of my fear."</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107894592381&amp;s=0&amp;e=001-sSEPifDno2InbrDKtb6LuoZC2flU1cQ72Iat0PrbMjgyWon_WSWyVR7RmlIwHiCeZldPhcVuV7ubKWq4lnEzVdi4MHePZmK4mY-6SXlC87spV-MCV8n4sL4Ka1NeoQ67-7qt37qX5AON5oGKC2fd0Z5nTx5daGuq-25cB7EaJByTY3IzXw6E9nsHvu8nhGoP3gQ092LbZM=" target="_blank">Esther 4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Honestly,  it seems like a small step, right? Just go in and see the king. Not a  big deal if youre the queen. Except it was. It was a step that could  get Esther killed. By going in to see the king uninvited--even though  she was the queen--her life was literally at risk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We  may not face decisions today that look like actual suicide. But what  about decisions that are social suicide? (Why would you be friends with her?) Career suicide? (Youre going to say that to the boss?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>These  kind of decisions come around much more often. The question is whether  were willing to make the same move that Esther did--to take the risk in  spite of our fear and regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take  a few minutes and think through the rest of your day. Is there anywhere  that God may want you to make a decision like Esthers? Ask Him for the  courage to move in those moments when youre fearful.</p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div><em>The   Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the   weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with   your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also   subscribe to The Daily.</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Weve  spent the last week looking at people who moved in faith and  experienced the miraculous. God extends the same invitation to you.How  are you responding?</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>In   what area of your life are you feeling encouraged to ask God for the   miraculous? Share that thought with someone you trust so they can   partner in prayer with you about it. </li>
<li>Is  there a particular  section of scripture or a particular character from  this week who you  identify with strongly? Consider doing some further  study around that  scripture or character. This could mean reading a book  about that  character, or discussing a section of scripture with a group  of people.</li>
</ul>
