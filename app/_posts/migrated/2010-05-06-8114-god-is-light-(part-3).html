<p>God is Light (Part 3)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study his nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%2011:14-15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 11:14-15</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This idea of light is not just a mental exercise for our amusement; its incredibly serious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An old adage says, All that glitters is not gold. This is true in both life and in the spiritual world. Some things look OK on the surface, but theyre not pure or good.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you participated in the recent Free journey, you might have uncovered some of these things: freedom that seemed real and satisfying on the surface, but ended up bringing bondage.</p>
<ul>
<li>What situations have you encountered where the reality was different than what was presented?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We are bombarded with many messages that seem to make perfect sense, but turn out to be counterfeit after a closer look. The most effective lies are wrapped with tiny bits of truth. Ask God to reveal his light in a special way today.</p>

<p></p>
