<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%205:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Deuteronomy 5:15</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God delivered the Israelite nation out of slavery in the Old Testament, and then he began to train them how to live like free men and women. One way was to give them a law about resting--Sabbath. This was a constant reminder of Gods goodness, and the opposite of slavery, which was constant toil.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its easy to become addicted to work even if you are not a slave. Its a powerful thing to be able to create, produce, make money, and generally get it done. If were not careful, what makes us feel in control begins to control us. Sabbath gives us a day to remember that we are not slaves, and that God, our Father, loves us without our needing to earn it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 11</a></span></p>
