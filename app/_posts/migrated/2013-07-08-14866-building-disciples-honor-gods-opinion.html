<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Disciples: Honor Gods Opinion</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">To be a good disciple you must put Gods opinion over anyone elses. Focus on verse 17.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:13-17&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16:13-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus blessed Peter because he proclaimed who Jesus really was. We can have this in our own lives if we believe entirely in Jesus and his character. God desires that we value his opinion over any other. He wants us to trust that he has good things for us and to understand that we will never be truly filled up by anything besides him. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about people in your life whose opinion you tend to value over Gods.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 9</a></p>
