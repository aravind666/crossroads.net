<p class="noPspace">We continue to look today at how we invest our resources based on Jesus teaching in Matthew. We are looking at the same passage today, but in a different translation. Focus on verse 23.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:19-23&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 6:19-23</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">What does this mean in verse 23? We are at risk of thinking back through where we spend our time and what we look at and mis-labeling whether that is dark or light, good or bad. Yesterday we assessed where we spend our vision. Jesus knew that we were at high risk when we did an exercise like that of calling bad good. That might sound like, Oh, well, when I watch _________ on television it really helps me relax, so I can_______. Did you find yourself assessing in that way yesterday? Do you ever justify how you spend your time or what you invest your eyes into?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Relook at the exercise from yesterday, and see if you mis-labeled or justified your time and eye investment. If you didnt do the exercise yesterday, ask God to reveal to you where you might be falsely investing and justifying (then listen to see what pops up).</p>
