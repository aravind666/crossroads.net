<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>BRING YOU BEANS &amp; RICE MONEY TO SERVICES THIS WEEKEND</strong></p>
<div>Saturday and Sunday, well be collecting out beans &amp; rice contributions within the first ten minutes of each service and investing in four great organizations outside Crossroads. If youve been out of town or avoiding this gassy experiment, all information about the why and where all the cash is going can be found at<a href="/beansandriceweek" target="_blank">crossroads.net/beansandriceweek</a>.</div>
</div>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You can give to the "beans and rice week" fund in one of four ways:</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">1. Write a check. Put "beans and rice" on the memo line and bring your check to services this weekend.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">2. Bring cash. It doesnt matter if its a pile of fives or a crapload of dimes, you can hand it off in the service.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">3. Give (early) via computer. Go to <a href="/give" target="_blank">crossroads.net/give.</a> Select "One-Time Gift" (youll be asked to log in), and select "Beans and Rice."</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">4. Give via smartphone or tablet. Go to <a href="/give" target="_blank">crossroads.net/give</a> and select "Beans and Rice."</p>
