<p>Asking</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, build trust in me as I seek you.</em> </p>

<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:10-28&amp;version=NIV">1 Samuel 1:10-28</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>You may understand the ache for a child that Hannah experienced, or maybe its a longing for something else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we ask God for something and either dont understand his response or feel like hes silent, it can be tempting to throw in the towel. But Hannah, amidst her anguish and bitterness, keeps asking and seeking. In other words, she keeps trusting. And the reward for this continuous asking isnt just the child, Samuel. The bigger reward is the deepened relationship between Hannah and her Father.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Where have you stopped asking? Ask now, with boldness. And ask again tomorrow.</p>
