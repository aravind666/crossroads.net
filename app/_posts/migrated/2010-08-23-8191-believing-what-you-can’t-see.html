<p>Believing What You Cant See</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to help you trust in his promises.</em></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with the story of Noah, but we probably dont think about what it was like to actually be Noah.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine this: You hear a voice (from a being that you cant see or explain) tell you to build a giant boat (nowhere near the ocean) because a huge rainstorm (whats that?) is coming to flood the entire earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet rather than assuming he had lost his mind and asking for a little padded room to live in, Noah chose to believe what he heard. He believed that God existed and that He could be trusted to follow through on what he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what faithfulness looks like for usbelieving and acting on what God promises.</p>
<ul>
<li>What areas of your life are you struggling to believe what you cant see?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Just like Noah, we are also faced with promises from God where we are unable to see how the outcome will workones like, If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This promise might not really make sense to us, and maybe were not sure how it will literally work, but it is an opportunity to trust God. Ask God to bring ideas to your mind about how you can act with kindness toward your enemies today.</p>
