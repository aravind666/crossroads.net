<p class="noPspace">News of growth and transition to report: first, the projects in both Kolkata and Mumbai are making a huge impact on the restoration of trafficking survivors. </p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">In Kolkata, discussions are underway to partner with World Vision, meaning that healing and reintegration will be made possible for even more young women. We’re excited about what this partnership could yield and hope you’ll join us in prayer that God’s hand is in the process.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Second, our project in Mumbai recently experienced a transition. Keith and Ramona Dsouza have moved on to new endeavors, but we’re pleased to report that our partnerships with Indian aftercare providers are moving forward. The existing aftercare homes our Indian church partners opened under the Dsouzas’ leadership remain open, and Crossroads’ own Cheryl and Dave Miyamasu are now leading the Game Change effort with the Indian church.  We appreciate the Dsouzas’ service and pray for God’s guidance as they enter this new chapter. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Cheryl and Dave were asked to take over where the Dsouzas left off just as they were returning to Mumbai from a month of R&amp;R in the U.S. Leaving home, friends, and family was tough but fortunately they had a big welcome waiting for them in India. The young women rehabilitating in Crossroads-supported homes organized a celebration with games, dinner, ice cream, dancing, prayer, singing and congratulations to Cheryl for taking over as Project Director. “It felt like a big family reunion,” Cheryl recalls. “Everyone was laughing and smiling and it was obvious that the girls were really excited about my new position.”</p>
