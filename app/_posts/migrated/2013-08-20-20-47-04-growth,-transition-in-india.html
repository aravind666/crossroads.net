<p class=\"noPspace\">News of growth and transition to report&#58; first, the projects in both Kolkata and Mumbai are making a huge impact on the restoration of trafficking survivors. </p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">In Kolkata, discussions are underway to partner with World Vision, meaning that healing and reintegration will be made possible for even more young women. We&rsquo;re excited about what this partnership could yield and hope you&rsquo;ll join us in prayer that God&rsquo;s hand is in the process.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Second, our project in Mumbai recently experienced a transition. Keith and Ramona Dsouza have moved on to new endeavors, but we&rsquo;re pleased to report that our partnerships with Indian aftercare providers are moving forward. The existing aftercare homes our Indian church partners opened under the Dsouzas&rsquo; leadership remain open, and Crossroads&rsquo; own Cheryl and Dave Miyamasu are now leading the Game Change effort with the Indian church. &nbsp;We appreciate the Dsouzas&rsquo; service and pray for God&rsquo;s guidance as they enter this new chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Cheryl and Dave were asked to take over where the Dsouzas left off just as they were returning to Mumbai from a month of R&amp;R in the U.S. Leaving home, friends, and family was tough but fortunately they had a big welcome waiting for them in India. The young women rehabilitating in Crossroads-supported homes organized a celebration with games, dinner, ice cream, dancing, prayer, singing and congratulations to Cheryl for taking over as Project Director. &ldquo;It felt like a big family reunion,&rdquo; Cheryl recalls. &ldquo;Everyone was laughing and smiling and it was obvious that the girls were really excited about my new position.&rdquo;</p>
