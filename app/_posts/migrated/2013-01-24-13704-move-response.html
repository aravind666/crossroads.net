<p class="noPspace"><strong>Move: Response</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today, we finish this weeks study of Paul as a model of how to share our faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001tzHJcnQdxot-HnubWS37GQs1NdAQZQravSvTTAnb3pk9c7vUUUrksn_sWxQn6cnt4f6yM38KAVosGG9PLAdMOo-mluOTLgUwGe4HnJT1AYq88hHCIROd2dy4UL7EI1dvbmC3u0VlhQ_G0iUEmzyA2GKRqF2I3iSr7dpnm0vQKikXDGemg_p5oWBA4ZwQIjf6LhYqrZ5d_Qc_zsO_Dg0dRQ==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 17:32-34</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The church is not a building. Its all of us who want to follow Jesus, coming together to be a movement. We can change the world through chasing after big causes, like sex trafficking in India, the AIDS epidemic in South Africa, and poverty in our city. As awesome as those causes are when we work together, we must consider that the spiritual poverty of our neighbors is an equal tragedy. There are people hurting that you look in the eye everyday.</p>

<p class="noPspace">The passage ends this week with some people showing interest in the gospel (good news) that Paul has presented, and some walking away. Peoples responses can not be our motivator. Not every girl in India wants to be rescued, not every man in South Africa wants to be tested, not every family in poverty wants support, but it is because they cant even imagine what freedom looks like. If you have even a small taste of the good stuff that God is leading you into, share it.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Picture that someone you know (or listed earlier this week) experiences freedom through Christ. Really picture what it could look like, and then pray for it to happen.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss something you learned this week about having a conversation about God.</li>
<li>Which step is the most difficult for you to do and why?</li>
<li>Practice sharing with your group how you might share the good news of God.</li>
</ul>
