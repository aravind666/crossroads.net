<p><strong>Week 1: Experiencing Peace</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, November 22</strong></p>
<p>Experiencing Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me understand the peace you offer me and how I can invite more of it into my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%2014:27%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 14:27</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Even though most of us would say wed love to experience more peace, we often shoot ourselves in the foot. Because although we may want to stay calm and trust that God is in control, it can feel oddly satisfying to swim in our own drama, to relive old hurts, to get angry, to muster up worries. We might want peace, but we often push it away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus said: Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Hes our direct line: the source. And His peace isnt abstract or conditional. Its not something reserved for hippies or eighty-year-olds on a golf course. His peace is tangible, current and available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These next two weeks well look at what inner peace is all about. Because whether or not weve ever felt it, its something God wants to give us in abundance. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Get a piece of paper (better yet, a notebook or journal) and have it on hand when you do The Daily for these next two weeks. On it, write something that you feel peace about. It could be significant or minor: a friendship, a job choice, the way you handled a situation. Underneath it, describe why you feel peace about it.</p>
