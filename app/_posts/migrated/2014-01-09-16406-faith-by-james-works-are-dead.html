<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: Works are Dead</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to open your eyes, your heart and your mind to something new.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">James 2:26</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201:6&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Philippians 1:6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Faith without works is as useless as a screen door on a submarine, but dont make that list of good-deed-doing just yet. God doesnt need you to do things---his work will be completed. And no matter who we are, God is already crazy about us and nothing we do will make him love us more. But our day-to-day lives can be a natural reflection of Gods love and grace if we let it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today or all weekend, think of a way you can share God with someone else. Maybe its a phone call to a friend you dont see much or sharing a meal with grandma. Basically, how does someone in your life feel loved? Go and do that.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 5</a></p>
