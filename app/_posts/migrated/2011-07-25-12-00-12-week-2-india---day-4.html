<p class=\"noPspace\">Five of the six of us were doing well, but one had the impact of &ldquo;Bombay belly&rdquo;.&nbsp; We finally experienced the monsoons &ndash; from the comfort of the hotel restaurant. We truly appeared as tourists as we had our cameras out.&nbsp; The drive to the Youth Conference took from 45 an 75 minutes &ndash; depending upon which car you were in!&nbsp; We originally planned for 120 youth (ages 18-30) to attend, but we received a call from Pastor Vivian (male pastor) to ask if additional youth could join us. We said yes. &nbsp;Later he called back to Keith and asked if he could invite additional pastors from MBS. We were honored, and the crowd multiplied. In total, we had approximately 280 attend the conference!&nbsp; Several buses came from remote locations (driving 3 hrs one way to attend).&nbsp;</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\">We learned the meaning of flexibility with several changes to &ldquo;the plan&rdquo; for the day. &nbsp;Pastor Vivian shared that he did not want to use the 2 hr video that had been planned, as it didn&rsquo;t focus on sex trafficking and was in English (several youth only knew Hindi).&nbsp; Ramona&rsquo;s leadership was invaluable, as she managed the transition in the agenda with ease. She had the ability to sense the audience, and engage them in each of the presentations. Our team spoke once again; we modified what we shared at yesterday&rsquo;s conference but this time everyone was able to share why they were committed to making a difference in the fight against sex trafficking.&nbsp; We all learned the value of a great interpretor (ask us about this!).&nbsp; &nbsp;The pastors felt moved to enage, clarify and call the youth to action.&nbsp; The conference was scheduled to be over at 3&#58;30 pm but the youth did not want to leave. So we created small groups (of 25!) for discussion on what they would do if they thought a girl in their neighborhood was being forced to do something against her will.&nbsp; We could tell from their responses that they had learned a lot and were committed to making a difference.</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\">The youth each filled out a form to provide feedback and had the opportunity to make a wriiten commitment about how they wanted to be involved.&nbsp; We also had several women offer to be witnesses&nbsp; when IJM does rescues for minors.&nbsp;&nbsp; What an awesome day when we rely on God to stir the hearts of young Christ followers!</p>
