<p class=\"noPspace\">It&rsquo;s your friends in Mumbai, closing out another long day here in the  Maximum City. Thanks for the comments and well wishes-our crew is tired  but engaged in the fight, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Today  we spent time in the government home for girls who have just been  rescued, and our group was prepared for the realities this evil inflicts  on these girls. What most of us received, though, was a confusing mix  of incredible joy and deep sadness. We interacted with girls who hadn&rsquo;t  yet gotten out of their brothel night gowns from the night before,  making crafts besides pleasant young women who made it easy to forget  the hell they&rsquo;d been living in a few days or weeks earlier. This work  can be confusing, oftentimes sending one on a roller coaster of  emotions, highs and lows coming one after another.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;<br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">After  the fastest 2.5 hours of my life, we debriefed over chai tea  (temperature&#58; atomic) before heading to the red light district. Driving  through an epicenter of brothels and trafficking, it was easy to feel  very small and insignificant. What good could we really accomplish here,  the 22 of us? The problem is very big, easily overwhelming the best  resources we bring to the table. For every dollar we put against this  work, it seems to require a million more.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">But tonight,  following our debrief, I was reminded of a passage in scripture, when  Jesus is explaining how his Kingdom works to his disciples. He told them  another parable&#58; \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a  man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all  seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes  a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\" (Matthew  13&#58;31, 32 NIV)</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">I&rsquo;ll rest tonight with a mustard seed of  faith that the Kingdom was planted today,and once it takes root, it  will overcome this city,and those girl&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Good night,</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\"><em><br /></em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>So it&rsquo;s been another day full of memories and adventure, and yet at the same time I can&rsquo;t find the words to put down everything that we&rsquo;ve been through. So why not start with the end first? </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>This evening after visiting the government home for the girls, many of us set out in our cars to drive through the red light districts of Mumbai and see first hand the streets where all this evil is taking place. The drive was long in rush hour traffic, and we got lost as a group several times, with one of our cars never even making it to our intended destination. As we passed from the major streets down to side streets and further down to one lane roads that barely held our SUV&rsquo;s, a claustrophobia set in that I never knew I had as the people and shacks around us pushed close to our window. It all came to a pinnacle when a cow blocked the street for a bit (yes in downtown Mumbai) despite our wonderful Crossover foundation staff doing their best to get it out of the way. </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Soon enough we made our way around the cow and out (all but one car) and made it to the brothel district where we drove past the numerous women waiting on the streets for the night ahead. There is little need to say anything more about the sights around us, since it looked like most Mumbai streets with the shops, garbage, and homeless, the only difference being the women out from somewhere and standing around. The drive back to the hotel took nearly two hours due to the stop and go traffic, and some time after we all arrived, our lost car pulled in twenty minutes later, giving us a complete group and a completely safe group. </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Now to this morning and the aftercare home. I&rsquo;m sorry now&nbsp; if my words don&rsquo;t do us any justice, or properly convey what any of us experienced, for it is quite a mixed bag of emotions to put down on a keyboard. The government home is a home meant for girls who have been rescued, some rescued as soon as that morning or the day before, and it is meant for girls who are ages 18 and above. Driving into the compound (yes compound, use your imagination, barbed wire and all), we had been warned about the possible attitudes the girls might have, and the lack of facilities that they have been provided in the past, but today we were pleasantly surprised to find that the new facility recently built for the girls was quite nice, clean and well maintained. The facility was filled past it&rsquo;s 200 person capacity, but when we walked in and had a tour of the place, we were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by more smiling faces than we expected. Over the next two and a half hours, we were able to split up into groups and do crafts with the girls, giving them a chance to flex their creativity which, if I do say so myself, is out-of-this-world good. I was working in a room where we had small boxes that the girls could decorate however they wished and keep for themselves to keep any personal belongings. Though very nervous at first, I found that several of the girls were very nice, and had a light, a sense of hope shining behind their eyes. The box room was a success, and we were soon packed with people blazing through our supply of stickers, glitter, glue and random other craft supplies. </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>When it was time to leave, I was shocked that we had been there over two hours and was sad to head out to our cars. Going in I can say that as a whole we werent really sure what to expect, but as we walked across the dirt lawn of the aftercare home, I dont think that any of us expected to see a small crowd of girls standing in the door with smiles on their faces, waving goodbye to us as we pulled out the gates. At this moment I was on an emotional high from great work we had all done in connecting with these girls, and as we drove out, past the wall with the wire, and the moat, a big reminder was sent crashing back to me and the others in my car. Some pimps who lay claim to some of the girls inside were waiting outside of the compound for a chance that \"their\" girls might be released, which is an absolute possibility.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Friends, I can tell you that some amazing progress has been made in Mumbai, and there is reason to rejoice in the fact that we have made steps in helping many young girls, and at the same time I can tell you that there is still progress to be made. Everyday more people here and back home are becoming aware of the growing problem that surrounds them, and the only problem is that it is still a growing problem. A good friend told me a story last night, and though you may have heard it, I will tell it to you now ( Sorry if Andrew tells it to, I cant see his blog yet) and I believe it sums up the situation in a nutshell. </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>One day, a boy walks onto a beach that is covered in starfish drying out in the sun. For as far as he can see down the beach, it is covered in washed up starfish that are lying helpless to the heat above. As soon as he sees this, he starts walking and picking them up, only to throw them out into the ocean again, safe from the sun, giving them life once more. Somewhere down the beach an old man sees the young boy and is struck curious. Hobbling up to the boy he looks at him throwing starfish after starfish back into the sea, back to life. The old man asks the boy, \"Child, there are so so many starfish here on the beach, for as far as we can see they go on, why are you bothering to throw them back? What difference does it make when there are so many dying before you reach them? </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>The young boys stops for a second, as he looks down at the starfish in his hand. \"I may not be able to reach every starfish,\" he says \"But it made a difference to this one.\"</em></p>
