our 2008 "all church journey" is now in week seven (...one more to go!) This past weekend,
Brian Tome spoke to us about how God coming to earth was the most generous act ever known. God emptied
himself, took on human form, died on a cross and came back to life to
conquer death. This is the message of Easter.<br><br>(With the new "spread out" service times, it seems the volunteer parking team also experienced a kind of life after years of slow, painful death...)<br><br>As always, if you missed the service you can <a href="/">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="/">watch it</a>. Also, here's a PDF of <a href="/">this weekend's program</a>.<br><br>Don't forget that <strong>Community Group sign-up</strong> is alive and kicking. Make sure to check out the <a href="/">Community Groups page</a> for more info.</body></html>
