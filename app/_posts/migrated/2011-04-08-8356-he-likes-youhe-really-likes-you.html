<p>He Likes You...He Really Likes You</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to make his words unique and newly personal to you today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20103&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 103</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Lately, weve explored the character of God that shows up in what might have been unexpected places. Who knew that the wrathful and angry God many of us know so well from the Old Testament is also generous, faithful, merciful, kind and forgiving? God hasnt changed. The god who healed the sick and dying, provided for the poor and loved the unlovable isnt just the one we read about once Jesus came on the scene. Its the way Hes always been and always will be. Hes the same yesterday, today and forever (Hebrews 13:8).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a second look at the Psalm you read today and ask God to reveal more about who he is while you read it again. Then take a few minutes to write down what you see about the character of God in the story. If youre up for it, take an experience from your own life and do the same thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&amp;version=NIV">Galatians 3</a></p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Weve referred to Hebrews 13:8 several times these past two weeks, because it really is the point. It says that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Since Jesus is literally God, that means theres no such thing as an Old Testament God and a New Testament God. God is consistently loving, just, merciful, powerful, and engaged in the lives of everyday people on every page of scripture.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>How can knowing that Gods character is consistent impact your life? (For instance, consider when you doubt Gods consistency and how that impacts you or others around you.)</li>
<li>Fill in the blank: Based on the scriptures weve looked at these past few weeks, when I think about how to characterize God in the Old Testament the words I choose are ____________ .</li>
</ul>
