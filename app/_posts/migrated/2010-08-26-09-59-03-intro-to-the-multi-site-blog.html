<p class="normal noPspace">Welcome to the Multi-site blog. Here you&rsquo;ll read more about the vision for multi-site expansion, as well as updates on how multi-site is playing out at Mason and other future locations.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">You&rsquo;ll also read stories from volunteers working at Mason and how multi-site has affected them, and you&rsquo;ll be able to respond with your own stories of how God is moving in your life through the multi-site vision.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Subscribe or check back to this blog for stories, photo, video and more. We hope you&rsquo;ll follow and participate in the discussion about where God is taking multi-site at Crossroads.</p>
