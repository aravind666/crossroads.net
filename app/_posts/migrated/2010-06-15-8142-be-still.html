<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Over and over, the Bible reveals extraordinary experiences of early followers of Jesus. And these adventures were the result of listening and responding to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit has been described as Gods still, small voice that you can hear or sense. But in the business of life, its easy to drown that voice out. In order to lead a life of adventure, you must first be willing to be still and listen. Seems counterintuitive, right? Yet, we see it in account after account from the Bible. A life led by the Holy Spirit is exciting, because you realize your life isnt yours to own or control.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Close your laptop, turn off the music, and move out of the company of co-workers or family. Ask the Holy Spirit to come into these moments, then be still. Listen. It may take a few minutes to settle your mind or push aside the days responsibilities. Dont be discouraged. Write down any thoughts or promptings you have, and then ask God to confirm if any of those are from him. And just so you know, while He could be whispering, "Move to Africa," its probably much more likely that you could hear, "Say hello to that annoying cube mate." Both take courage to act uponbut more on that tomorrow.</p>
