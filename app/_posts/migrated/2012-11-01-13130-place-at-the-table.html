<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God is not an apathetic, absent or controlling Dad. He wont force you to spend time with him, though he does want to spend time with you. Take a moment right now to picture your Dad sitting in his study (maybe, in the house that you wish you had grown up in). You go and you push the door open. His first response at seeing you is excitement. He is so glad that its you. You walk in and sit on the couch in your Dads study, maybe you even lay down. You can talk to Him and he has plenty of time for you, or you can just be there and know he is near.</p>
