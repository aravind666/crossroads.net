<p class="noPspace"> We are running out of space during prime time services in Oakley. But we’re not just going to build a larger auditorium. That’s what the church world says to do: Upgrade the plasmas. Improve the sound system. Or just stay where you’re at, because we’re "big enough."</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">But that doesn’t change the game. What if we take the model and turn it on its head? Stop trying to get bigger and bigger, and instead decentralize ourselves into communities all across Cincinnati. Not to be a church with multiple sites, but a church of multiple sites. Catch the difference? We change the game when we’re one church with multiple locations, advancing the Kingdom of God in our individual communities, with our neighbors and friends alongside.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">To realize that vision, we want to open additional locations like Crossroads Mason (which opened in October 2008 in rented space at Mason Middle School) in areas where our friends and neighbors live. That way people can spend more time connecting with each other and God, and less time driving, or just not going to church at all. And as we grow in other communities, we can continue to mobilize one team with a unified vision, ready to bless our city and our world in increasing ways.</p>
