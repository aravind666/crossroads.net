<p>Whom Will You Serve?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, remind me of the ways youve been faithful in my life. Thank you for keeping your promises.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2024:8-15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Joshua 24:8-15</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Throughout  his life, God asked a lot of Joshua. He asked him to lead the  Israelites across the Jordan River and through many battles for the  Promised Land. Joshua always obeyed, and God always kept his promises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As  he approached the end of his life, Joshua continued a life-long pattern  of speaking boldly to the people. This time, he presented them with a  simple challenge, "Whom will you serve?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>We  all make decisions. Some are more critical than others. But the reality  is our choices point to whats most important to us. In some cases,  maybe even our "idols." Like Bob Dylan said, "It may be the devil, or it  may be the Lord, but youre gonna have to serve somebody."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>As  you go through your day, consider each choice you make no matter how  small. Ask God to show you the idols in your life, and who or what you  are serving. It may be yourself, or your money, or your Facebook  profile. Jesus said that no one can serve two masters. Ask Gods  forgiveness for any idols in your life. Make a new covenant with Him  that "you and your house will serve the Lord."</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>

<p><br><strong>WEEK TWO DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What  distracts you from staying focused on God and his will for your life?  Maybe its unhealthy relationships, selfish interests or a need to be in  control? Take turns sharing these distractions with the group.</li>
<li>This  week we saw much evidence of God keeping his promises. How do you feel  about Gods promises in your life? Do you have faith that He will keep  them? Or do you doubt? Take turns confessing any fears or doubts. And as  a group, ask God to honor your confessions and build your faith.</li>
<li>What  role does worship play in your daily life? The Bible shows us that it  can be super powerful. As a group, take some time to worship together.  There are many ways to worship. You can read aloud some passages from  the book of Psalms, or sing along to a worship cd together. Or simply  spend some time in prayer together reminding God of his greatness and  all the wonderful things he has done in your life.</li>
</ul>
