<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Little Town: Journey to Bethlehem</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God had chosen Mary and Joseph, two unlikely characters, to change the world. But it wouldnt happen over night. The young couple had a journey of sacrifice ahead of them.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>LISTEN</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Mary and Joseph were preparing to have a baby. At the same time, the Roman Empire, who had rule over Judea, asked for a tax census to be taken forcing the young couple to journey to Bethlehem, Josephs ancestral home.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This was no family road trip. Judeas geography is made up of desert and mountains---a dangerous trek for even the experienced traveler. But Mary was pregnant and historians believe they traveled in the heat and drought of late summer. This was not a walk in the park.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yet, Gods rescue plan was in motion and the town of Bethlehem would play a pivotal role in the story to save his people. Getting there was a sacrifice Mary and Joseph were willing to make.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What can you sacrifice today? Maybe you forego dinner out or time at work to spend with your family, ask God to guide you as you sacrifice something for his greater story.</p>
