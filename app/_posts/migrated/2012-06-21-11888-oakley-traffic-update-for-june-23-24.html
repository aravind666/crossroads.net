<p class="noPspace">The Kennedy Connector project is well underway, and it may impact weekend traffic in Oakley.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the gravel lot off Ibsen has been encroached by the city, so park there at your own risk.</li>
<li>Both sections of Ibsen still have limited access and may be closed to traffic.</li>
<li>You can still use the Annex for overflow parking, though you will need to access the Annex lot from Marburg or Madison, as entry from Vandercar will be blocked.</li>
</ul>
