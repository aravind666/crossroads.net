<p><strong>Friday, February 19<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">New Creation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><em> <br></em></p>
<p><strong>READ<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%206:14-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 6:14-16<br></a>(Click to view the scripture online.)</span></strong></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">How does Paul finish his letter to the church at Galatia? By reiterating the point hes been making over and over: nothing matters except what Jesus has done for you on the cross. By believing that God has taken away your sin by Jesus death and resurrection, you are freed from the burden of law keeping and can instead choose to live by Gods Spirit, which means freedom and eternal life.</span></strong></p>
<p>When you receive Jesus, you become an entirely new creation.</p>
<p>Although it can be hard to accept, following the law will not get us any closer to God. Thats the old code, and we were made new because of Jesus. The new way to live is letting our faith express itself through our love.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you think of yourself as a new creation, whats the first thing that comes to mind? </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Thank God that he has the immense grace and love to make us into new creations. Ask Him to help you receive and apply the freedom that he wants for you.</span></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17-21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 5:17-21</a></span></strong></p>

<p class="BodyCxSpMiddle"><strong><br>Galatians Week Four Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</p>
<p>This week focused largely on the theme of fruit. Sometimes were unaware of the good fruit were producing, so its important for other Christ-followers to point those things out to us, and vice versa. In this way, we all grow. And by sharing what good fruit we want more of in our life, we can support and hold each other accountable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell someone about an example of good fruit that you see in their life. Then ask that person to do the same for you.</li>
<li>Which of the fruits of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control) do you want more of, and why? </li>
</ul>
