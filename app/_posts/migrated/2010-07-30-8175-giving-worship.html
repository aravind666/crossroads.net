<p>Giving Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2012:1&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:1</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Worship involves all of life. We see this, especially, in the words of Paul. He uses the terminology of sacrifice and worship in this way: "I urge you, brothers, in view of Gods mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to Godthis is your spiritual act of worship (Romans 12:1). All of life is to be worship, not just a few hours each week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paul even calls out giving as an act of worship. When Paul thanked the Philippians for sending him financial support, he indicated it was worship: "I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God" (Philippians 4:18). So the next time you give generously, youre worshipping God with that act. It makes sense why a cheerful giver brings God joy.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever considered giving as an act of worship? If not, how has giving felt in the past? Anything that feels like an obligation, or worse, is attached to a sense of guilt, is not God. Ask the Holy Spirit to unlock a spirit of generosity in you, and approach every opportunity to give as an opportunity to worship.</p>

<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>This week weve challenged assumptions on what worship is (and where it can take place), and have been encouraged to worship outside of the traditional form, whether that happens on a beach or by giving generously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has your understanding of worship been challenged, and if so, how? If not, describe how everyday worship looks in your own life.</li>
<li>Reflect on the Derek Webb line from Day 1: Worship is a system, its not an event. Its every human you talk to, and every penny you spend. What does that line mean in your life right now? How does it ring true (or false)?</li>
</ul>
