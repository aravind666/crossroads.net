<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When you receive your Dads love, you might feel more connected to him than you ever have. Thats what Jesus meant when he said "I am the vine; you are the branches." Were connected in ways we may never have thought possible and were set up to better hear from Him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whats important is to remain or abide in that love. That requires a constant, ongoing connection. It isnt always easy, but when we receive Dads love and trust his promises, we can hear and obey his commands. And Jesus said, "If you love me, obey my commands." Its what He wants us to do.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Spend 60 seconds (you can set a timer) and sit in your Dads love for you. Open your field guide to page 58 and write down whatever comes to mind. If theres an action involved--go and do it.</p>
