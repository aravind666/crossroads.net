<p>Listen and Trust</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: Holy Spirit, teach me to hear you better. Give me clear spiritual ears, and the trust to act on what I hear.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2016:13-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16:13-19</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Even today, people want to label Jesus as only a good prophet or teacher. It doesnt take faith or trust to mark Him as an important historical figure or religious leader; thats just stating the obvious. Relationships like friendships, marriages and parent-child relationships require more than a belief that someone exists and has a societal role. Relationships require trust in the deeper character of a person, and trust in the things weve come to experience about them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter is in this kind of deep relationship with Jesus. He doesnt just know of Him, he knows him. Jesus explains that this kind of knowing only comes from God. Confessing that Jesus is the Christ means seeing him as the prophesied Messiah that God promised, and that he is indeed God in the flesh. This kind of confession is a spiritual confession, not a human one. And confessing that Jesus is more than a historical religious teacher takes trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus statement back to Peter is amazing. Jesus trusts Peter in return, pouring out on him crazy things like keys to the Kingdom. It seems like Peters trust has indeed unlocked the bigger picture of what God has in store for Peter. And for us as well.</p>

<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Who do you say Jesus is? Do you believe He is the Christ, the son of the living God?</p>
