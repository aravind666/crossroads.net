<p>When God Himself Shows Up</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please give me a bigger and more intimate picture of you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Mark 1: 1-11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:%201-11&amp;version=NIV">Mark 1:1-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So this guy, John, he was a prophet. He was one of those men from the Old Testament who did miracles, spoke for God, and prophesied about God sending a rescuer. For all of Israels history, guys like John had been the voice of God. Then Jesus comes along, and John says he doesnt even belong in His presence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you imagine the reaction of the crowd? The confusion? Maybe even the feelings of abandonment or distrust? While Johns listeners had been expecting a rescuer from God, few among them expected that rescuer to be God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>John had been telling people to repent and be baptized, which Jesus obviously didnt need to do. Spend a few minutes looking over this passage in Mark again, and ask God to help you understand the reason for Jesus baptism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 13" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013&amp;version=NIV">Acts: 13</a></p>
