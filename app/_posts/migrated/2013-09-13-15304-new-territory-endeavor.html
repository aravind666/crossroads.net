<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New Territory: Endeavor</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you are eating Isaiah 54 with a spoon this week, then today, verse 5 will feel like dessert.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 54:1-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">No matter your gender, weve been putting ourselves into the story this week by being the childless woman (since God is speaking to his people personified as a whole in this woman). He has taken the one who is desperate and given her new children, new territory and comforted her. As if that isnt enough, today is a drop-the-mic moment. God reminds us that the creator of all that is, including you, is the one who will hold your hand and walk with you intimately like a husband through this new endeavor.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Put your journal down today. Picture the thing that you are nervous about right now. Now, picture holding Gods hand as you walk into that situation. If you want to pick your journal back up and write about it, its cool.</p>
