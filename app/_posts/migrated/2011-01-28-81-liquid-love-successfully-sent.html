<p class="noPspace">Hey Cincinnati,</p>
<p class="noPspace">We just wanted to let you know that we happily received &amp; unloaded the first of two Thanksgiving Food Drive containers here in Mamelodi, SA. It feels pretty awesome to see them loaded in Cincy AND unloaded in SA. We were soakin up the Cincinnati love today as we cheered when the container arrived, jumped into the sweaty line of volunteers to unload it &amp; read the handwritten notes on the boxes. My favorite simply said, "To: Mamelodi, From: Your Good Friends in Cincinnati". So true. So rest assured, your liquid love arrived. </p>
