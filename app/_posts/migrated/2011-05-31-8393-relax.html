<p><strong>Tuesday, May 31 </strong><br>Relax</p>
<p><em><br>God, I want to trust your promises for me. Would you speak to me today about your plan for my life?</em></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2011:28-30&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 11:28-30</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Last week we talked about repentance: what it means to stop what were doing, raise the white flag and tell God that we need more of him than we thought we did. Then we let Him change and mold our hearts (just like David asked God to do in Psalm 51).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank goodness God doesnt leave the ones he loves in some sorry, crumpled, dejected state. Instead, when we come to Him, he invites us to simply relax in his love. We dont have to earn Gods love and we cant lose it just because we made a mistake. His love is freely given to us for the taking. Thats the definition of grace. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes to think about whether youre ready, or even willing, to receive all that God has for you. If you are, thank God for that. If youre not, ask God to talk to you about it.</p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT </strong><br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 1</a></p>
