<p class="noPspace"><strong>Trust Your Dad: Demian</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Demian is husband and father of five, living and working in Northside.(If you missed this weekends message, see a summary<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0012g2MKS252WgV_vreWUlo5qCwWNu6vI04WBXQz9OC57U3WaFV8isejgcX3_za9jiLlNIpdRVGQwdg_fbM2na0VmZrTAU1u5dfODrftcj7Fn3sAIw1aIRgXGq1lNH_u5fl" shape="rect" target="_blank">here.</a>)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET DEMIAN</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"I created an idol out of my earthly Dad. He was a man with a strong vision to build a house from the foundation up, on a large piece of wooded land. As I watched my family begin to crumble after my sister passed and my mom and dad divorced, the house sat unfinished, and then eventually began to decay.</p>

<p class="noPspace">I continued to want to give time to its repair, but I began to realize that I was making an idol out of the house and my Dad. I had to divorce myself from understanding God through the lens of my earthly Dad. I had to let God retrain and embrace me in ways my earthly Dad never did...to let God truly father me.</p>

<p class="noPspace">I began to realize that the dreams that God had placed inside of me werent limited to a house, a region, a piece of land or a portion of the world. God, my heavenly Dad, had dreams that extended for me to far places. Ive experienced that through going to places like India. My earthly Dad always wanted to convince me of what could be, but I find that God, my true Dad, reveals to me what is. He is real. Learning to trust God is still a daily process, since my earthly Dad let me down. Its not something you figure out how to do and then run with, its a daily process to let my Dad embrace me and to walk in that trust."</p>
