<p class=\"noPspace\">Linsley Hartenstein showed recently that you can combine the things you&rsquo;re passionate about to have a positive impact on people, no matter your age.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Awhile back, the 16-year-old high school student entered a contest to get the Christian indie rock band Cloverton to play here in Cincinnati. &ldquo;I met the Cloverton guys at a camp I attended. They were super cool,&rdquo; Linsley says. &ldquo;A couple weeks after camp, the band posted a message on Facebook saying they were having a contest to bring the band to your hometown. One of my friends told me I should enter, so I did!&rdquo; Linsley recorded a video of herself singing one of their songs and posted it on YouTube.&nbsp; To her surprise, it was a winner. &ldquo;I was excited and humbled,&rdquo; Linsley remembers. &ldquo;I knew God could do some awesome things through this event.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Music is a big part of Linsley&rsquo;s life, but before the contest came along, Linsley had been praying and talking to her dad about something else close to her heart&#58; the Game Change campaign.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt called to do something.&nbsp; I told my Dad that if by any slim chance I won, I would ask the guys if they would be willing to make it a benefit concert,&rdquo; she says. So she did just that&#58; on April 17 at The Underground, Linsley and her band The Emerson Project opened for Cloverton, enjoyed a rocker of a free concert and ended up raising $1,000 for Game Change. &ldquo;My friend and I had written a song for the benefit,&rdquo; Linsley recalls. &ldquo;We made this our last song and I explained what the song was about and a little bit of my heart for [India].&rdquo; Concert attendees could then get their own CD of the tune for a donation of $5 or more.&nbsp; The donations rolled in, everyone had a great evening and more people were made aware of what&rsquo;s happening in India.</p>

<p class=\"noPspace\">Where others might lament what&rsquo;s happening on the other side of the world and simply go enjoy a concert with friends, Linsley proved that the actions of one person really can affect the lives of many. &ldquo;God is definitely moving, and what He is doing through Game Change is going to change people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; she explains, pointing to multi-site, South Africa and India as her motivators. &ldquo;I have been going to Crossroads Mason since it opened and have watched it grow and reach so many people,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;I went to Africa when I was 13, and seeing the need with my own eyes makes it very exciting to hear what&rsquo;s taking place in South Africa. &nbsp;With India, I think freedom, restoration and redemption for girls who are suffering is very parallel to our story. If God restores and redeems our brokenness, how can we not help them?&rdquo;</p>
