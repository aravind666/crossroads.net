<p>What a weekend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Across the city, 7000 of us from 50 churches got dirty and sweaty, with paint-splattered hands and mulch-stained shirts, at one of 400 projects. And while all the projects were different, one similarity stood out: everyone was part of bringing hope and life to something that previously seemed hopeless and lifeless. New flowers replaced weeds. Vibrant murals covered dirty walls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GO Cincinnati was an amazing day, but here are some ways you can GO and be the church 365 days a year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue volunteering for the organization you served during GO Cincinnati. If you noticed other needs while you were there, feel free to grab your friends and make it happen.</li>
<li>
<a title="Engage" href="/">Get engaged at Crossroads</a>. Whether it’s digging deeper in ReachOut or serving regularly with Kids’ Club or First Impressions, there are always opportunities to be a blessing to others, while making friends as you do it.</li>
<li>Find ways to be a blessing in your neighborhood or at work. It could be as simple as mowing your neighbor’s lawn or offering to babysit for a friend. Just go make it happen.</li>
</ul>
