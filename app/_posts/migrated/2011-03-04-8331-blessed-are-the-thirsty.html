<p><strong>Friday, March 4</strong></p>
<p>Blessed are the Thirsty</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please give me a new understanding of your character today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway John 4:1-42" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%204:%201-42&amp;version=NIV">John 4:1-42</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Finally, Jesus directly proclaims who he is. Not to powerful leaders. Not to the crowds of people he taught, healed or fed. Not even to his disciples, yet, who had left everything to follow him. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, Jesus declares himself to a woman who is an outcast amongst outcasts. A woman who knew she needed somethingsomeoneand had already gone through five men to find it. And with the sixth man, she was still searching. And this is the kind of person God is searching for: those who are thirsty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, mid-afternoon, Jesus takes a detour. He sits with a thirsty outcast. Its not exactly the way most of us would announce our presence as the rescuer of humanity. But it is the way you do it if your goal is to change the course of a life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Imagine that you were this person at the well. And suddenly you get Jesus full attention, his clear insight into your life and history, his direct guidance and knowingness. What does it feel like?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 19" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019&amp;version=NIV">Acts 19</a></p>

<p><strong>Week 2 Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the stories we read from Jesus life this week, there are a lot of expectations that changedwhether it was a human walking on water to a single woman getting Jesus full attention.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Which story stands out to you the most? Why?</li>
<li>What expectation that you have of Jesus, if any, would you like to see change or grow? If you cant think of an expectation, think about the last hard situation you struggled through, and how you interacted with Jesus during that time. (This might shed some light on an expectation you have.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are expectations about our own life that Jesus is challenging us to step beyond.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>How has God invited you to do the impossible, whether in the past or currently?</li>
<li>Do you think God sees you the same way as you see yourself? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
