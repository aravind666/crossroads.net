<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were exploring how God speaks to each of us. Today, well spend some time listening and looking for Him in art and music.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you something new through an artistic outlet.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:2</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are surrounded by art. From popular music on the radio to commercials on TV. For many of us, music, art and writing help us acknowledge and make sense of the world and connect us through shared experiences. More often than not, art is an expression of truth---no matter the format or where we find it. Thats where God speaks to us. He can reveal something through a painting hanging in the Cincinnati Art Museum or the billboard advertisement along the highway. The question is, are we positioned to recognize it?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, try experiencing God through an artistic activity. Listen to or sing your favorite song. Paint a picture with your kids. Write a story. Dance. Whatever it is---and you dont have to be good at it---what might God be saying to you through this experience?<span style="line-height: 1.75;">If youre having trouble thinking of something, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6hgNi6FV_0">heres a song you can sing or listen to</a>.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
