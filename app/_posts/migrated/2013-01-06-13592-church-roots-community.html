<p class="noPspace"><strong>Church Roots: Community</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Church is not a building its a community of people that have decided to follow Jesus and believe that they can live in such a way that impacts the world. For the next four weeks well be looking at what it means to follow God in community.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0014lcEJB-EKIFd7THWqEMuCQUiCCuiJGHbcgD4yoiFLC7XflZE2hOOwI2Zqrui2Y9FUj4PsLbAv6sl6fWhEnNr5QF-tJAitqXKurZq3Tp_S7VNBs0SvZ42XTq896vPvs2vfAvJfTxdVgJ6VhFf7rEdb5u9Ep_FZwh-KHggmOqCY8UiBOMMBKRKxZ5NdNgutPN3UPD_TMw80ttbqP7C8IXURw==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The first four books of the New Testament in the Bible tell the story of Jesus, and then are followed by Acts; aptly named because it is the first acts of those that chose to follow Jesus way of life.Well be looking at the different elements of this passage from the book of Acts everyday this week. Its chock full of what it means to be a "fellowship of believers".</p>

<p class="noPspace">Jesus has ascended, the disciples wait and receive the Holy Spirit, Peter does a public pronouncement, and then this passage is a description of what the gatherings of Christ followers looked like at the time. This is the beginning of what we still call church today. It is the original DNA of any gathering of believers.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of a time in your life when you may have experienced being part of something bigger than yourself and/or really good community. Ask God to show you what it could look like to have that in your life on a regular basis.</p>
