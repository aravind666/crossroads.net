<p class="noPspace"><strong>Church Roots: Response</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today, we will finish out looking at Acts 2 and the way it describes the beginning of the Church. Our focus today will be on verse 47.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001wLdbSWFczC1U4wKYm8H24WTwG_aiC9ANpQqV3SwozUjjYMnEjo-LBU2mW84PabEhbAh7CKtRGbROwQ5wHMQXdsR_4jh-WYdR2n4wKih8j-i6Wtz9s1L7l4A7phhN06OQIT2enF2lD2aPMwvXcPRES9Lzu56yfB4UCOuimC5_RIqZ15OPWYQ6MP4xkjSyqjpgGGJC-iMQF-tOeIU323tATw==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Acts 2 describes a way of life. A rag-tag collection of people living life together, eating together, going to temple together, seeing miracles, and changing the world. This is still the best glimpse we have of what we call the church--not a building, but the lifestyle of people who all come together to live a life like Jesus.Verse 47 shows the response that comes from living like this. Our response towards God is praise. The response of those who look in on us is favor. The result of that is a community of believers that grows. Thats been happening since Jesus ascended, and that movement is still happening. Its what we call the Church.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Ask God today to open your eyes to where he is moving and how he wants you to be a part of it.</p>
