<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Disciples: Receive Your New Identity</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are all a small part of the big family of God. Today, focus on verse 18. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:13-18&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 16:13-18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus gave Peter a new name meaning rock, signifying that he was a little rock that was a part of a bigger rock (the church). When we are adopted into the family of God, we are given a new identity. In the adoption process, we die to the ways of our old life and embrace the new life that God gives us. In our new identity, we are loved sons and daughters who are a part of a bigger family--the family of God. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write about ways you want to embrace your new identity. How does that make you view your relationship with God differently?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 10</a></p>
