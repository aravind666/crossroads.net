<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Paul endured many hardships during his ministry, including this confrontation with the Sanhedrin, a council of the Jews ruling religious leaders and supreme court. Paul was always bold (and in this case, a littletoobold with the man he didnt recognize as the Chief Priest). He was also strategic, here appealing to one faction of the Sanhedrin, the Pharisees, and highlighting the major theological difference that separated them from their counterparts on the council. Ultimately, though, Paul relied not on his own boldness or quick wit, but on the will of his master, Jesus, who appeared to encourage Paul that hed soon be out of trouble and on to Rome.</p>
