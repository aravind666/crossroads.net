<p class="noPspace"><strong>Give Thanks: Celebrate</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">There were many festivals in the Old Testament of the Bible that included an offering of Thanksgiving. Today is a day to fully celebrate that God is good, and revel in his blessings. Psalm 100 is literally called "A Thanksgiving Psalm" (even though it predates Pilgrims and Native Americans); its still a great Psalm for today.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">No matter what your Thanksgiving day looks like: time with family you love, time with stressful family, time with friends, time serving, or time alone; God is present with you. You can enter your Dads home, Gods presence, simply by saying, "thank you". No matter your location today, make your home in God by staying in a posture of thankfulness.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Even thought its Thanksgiving, we can be so busy that we dont actually thank God. Be intentional today about remaining in a posture of thankfulness.</p>
