<p>Faithfulness</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2012:1-2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:1-2</a><br><br><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">It might sound counter-intuitive, but you can have faith in God and still not live with faithfulness.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">You show faithfulness to what you think is important, whether thats a relationship, a career, a sports team, money, PC or Mac. Faithfulness to God means you dont bury your relationship with him. Your whole life reflects the love between you--not just on weekends, not just when youre volunteering, not just during conversations with fellow Christ-followers. Faithfulness is choosing to be a living sacrifice to God. Faithfulness to God centers your life and seeps into every part of it.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Ask God to show you where your faithlessness lies. Consider one way that you could start releasing its grip on your life and filling that part with His Spirit.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"></p>
