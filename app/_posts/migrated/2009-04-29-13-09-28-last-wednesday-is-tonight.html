For those who are keeping track of such things, today is the last Wednesday of the month, and hence...yes...we are having <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Last Wednesday</span> tonight at 7pm at Crossroads Oakley. It will be a great time of music, prayer and communion and we'll be hearing thoughts from Brian Tome about the Holy Spirit. See you there!
