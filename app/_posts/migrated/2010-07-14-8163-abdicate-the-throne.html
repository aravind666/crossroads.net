<p>Abdicate the Throne</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a few minutes and pray through the first verse of the Lords Prayer. Repeat it several times and ask God which word or phrase he wants you to pay attention to.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Luke%2017:20-21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 17:20-21</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So far weve looked at the first verse of the Lords Prayer: This, then, is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed is your name. This verse aligns us to God and the spiritual order of things. The next verse is an incredible request:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your kingdom come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are dangerous words to pray if you want to live selfishly, misuse power or lord over others. These are powerful words if you want to have your own kingdoms stripped away, and Gods kingdom put in the drivers seat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Lords Prayer brings the whole of life into the presence of God, and brings the whole of God into the whole of life. (William Barclay)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to reveal your personal kingdoms and help you step down from your throne.</p>
<p></p>
