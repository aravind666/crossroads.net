For those who heard the (amazing,incredible,humbling) story of the <strong>5 Kernels of Corn</strong> in last weekend's talk, (and if you didn't, perhaps you should <a href=\"../my/media/playMedia.php?idMedia=731\">give it a listen</a>), it's now available as a downloadable PDF <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/5kernels.pdf\">here</a>. <br /><br />Read it around the Thanksgiving table, or just amuse your friends and co-workers with your intimate knowledge of all-things-Pilgrim. (Trust me...it'll be hours of fun.)
