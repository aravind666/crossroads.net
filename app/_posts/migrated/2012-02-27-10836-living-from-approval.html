<p class="noPspace"><strong>Living From Approval</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, well look at receiving Gods approval (turns out its way simpler than we think). This is a continuation of the past few weeks studies, where weve considered our identities as Gods treasured children.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This is one of Jesus greatest examples of how we can live as treasured children of God. Jesus began his ministry on earth knowing that his heavenly Father loved him and was already proud of him. Simply put, Jesus livedfroma place of approval, rather than livingforapproval.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think about how working for the approval of others figures into your daily life. How might your day today look different if you knew youve already earned all the approval youll ever need?</p>
