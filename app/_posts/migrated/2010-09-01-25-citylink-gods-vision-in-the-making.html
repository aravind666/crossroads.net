<p class="normal noPspace">Thanks for taking time to check out this blog and dig deeper into this dream called CityLink. Its something that has been years in the makingsince 2003, in fact. But despite some of our past challenges, in all my years with CityLink, I honestly havent been more excited about our vision: Working together. Reducing poverty. Changing lives.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">In the Old Testament, the prophet Habakkuk says, Look at the nations and watchand be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told. (Habakkuk 1:5)</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">I believe this is what God is saying to us now. Despite the fact that the poverty rate in Cincinnati is nearly twice the national average, despite the racial division weve experienced in our city, despite the disparity that we currently see in our city between the haves and the have nots, I believe well all say in 2040 that Cincinnati is a different city. I believe well be utterly amazed. And I believe well say that God did something in Cincinnati, through imperfect yet passionate and faithful people like you and me, that we would not believe, even if we were told.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Lets change the game together.</p>
