<p>Autumn: Not Consumed</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, when I feel overwhelmed, may you remind me that it is because of your great love that I will not be consumed.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1107420327049&amp;s=0&amp;e=001b6Fr3X63a-zSc89JAR3gm6uTciO53Kwy3j0o1yxoKRXybdh3NK_Qm0uLI0FTIHtRxQFmT0UMVKenLG7E4hkKxmDiDkBaxOMR5NQAcVHiL32hMxsdV7wB0msB_qKs7JClZBRao5DnP1jNQVLWmXAGaMg4WGXvdfQ7K_XIitqgFhPbOc_IKHcFV3NJvqd_IxXqIWWNrxtIFeM4V0fZlmD4GR-F_qs-albiYNiYyPWYVQ4=" target="_blank">Lamentations 3:7-22</a></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The  writer of Lamentations, Jeremiah, doesnt hold back in lamenting. Not  only does he sound mournful, but also pretty ticked off. He lets God  have it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike  David in the Psalms we read, Jeremiah feels more than just forgotten;  he feels like God is against him. Whether this is true or not, Jeremiah  comes to an important conclusion by verse 22: the truth that it is the  Lords great unfailing love that saves us. And the truth that this  unfailing love is our source for hope. These conclusions, these truths,  are where we also land when, like Jeremiah, we have the faith to let God  have it. When we trust Him with the full spectrum of our emotions, and  place all that we have in his very capable arms, we experience how very  good he is. His love is not contingent on our human capacity to love.  His compassion never fails.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Contemplating  Gods goodness and compassion actually forms our minds. When we  contemplate a good God, we are formed into his image, more compassionate  and patient. Write a list of ways that you see Gods love, compassion  and goodness at work in the world around you and in yourself. If you  need to blurt your anger first, go there, but end with His goodness as  Jeremiah does.</p>

<p><strong>Week Three Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Autumn  is a necessary season of growth in our faith. We experience that the  world does not revolve around us, and move into a deeper place of  dependence on God.</p>
<ul>
<li>So  far, we have discussed spring, summer and autumn. Which season do you  think that you are truly in? If you are unsure, it may be winter, but  just guess for now-and discuss how you feel that season.</li>
<li>How  comfortable are you with the idea of "being real" with God? Are you  being honest with Him about how you really feel? Explain.</li>
<li>For  what are you waiting on God? A promise? A blessing? An end to  suffering? Are you patiently waiting with a content heart, or like  Jacob, are you wrestling with God? Both are good. Which place are you  in? Explain.</li>
</ul>
