<p>The Obvious Lions</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me hear and focus on your voice today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206:1-23&amp;version=NIV">Daniel 6:1-23</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Of course the law was unjust. Of course Daniels enemies wrote the law simply to trap him. Yet in spite of the obvious plan, Daniel did not waver in his commitment to God. He didnt just tell God to hang on for 30 days until it was safe to worship him again. He sought and relied upon his God all the way through the experience. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Daniel knew his future wasnt reliant on anything his enemies could do. If his freedom had been tied to his circumstances, it would have seemed like the bitter end. (Could bondage be more obvious or extreme than being locked up with multiple lions in a sealed cave?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Daniels freedom wasnt affected by circumstance. It was rooted in his relationship to God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Where have your circumstances made you feel like feel like Gods freedom is out of reach? Ask God to show you how hes bigger than those things.</p>
<p></p>
