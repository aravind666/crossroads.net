<p class="noPspace">For several years, Crossroads volunteers have been actively engaged in the work of justice through International Justice Mission and other local initiatives. Amy Shermans article <a href="http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2010/julaug/churchjusticemission.html#http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2010/julaug/churchjusticemission.html" target="_blank">A Church on a Mission</a> in Books and Culture highlights our involvement to-date.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Now, thanks to the incredible generosity of our community, we can truly change the game of aftercare in India. Our four-prong strategy involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to improve the quality of aftercare in Mumbai. Well be able to expand Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) to nearly 500 girls in Mumbai and improve the physical infrastructure of where they stay. </li>
<li>Creating new beds for an additional 170 girls by investing in establishment of two new aftercare homes, 12 group homes and one independent living project.</li>
<li>Expanding social enterprise opportunities for nearly 250 girls through our partners <a href="http://www.isanctuary.org/" target="_blank">iSanctuary</a> and <a href="http://www.freesetglobal.org/" target="_blank">Freeset</a>.</li>
<li>Developing a long-term presence on-the-ground in India that includes developing our relationship with local Indian churches who can embrace rescued girls in loving community. </li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">What an amazing God we serve  one who loves us and treasures the girls were going run after. Stay tuned to <a title="Crossroads" href="">crossroads.net</a> for more updates as we press go on the India initiative of Game Change.</p>
