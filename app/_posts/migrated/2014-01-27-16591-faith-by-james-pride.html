<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you read, ask God to show you something new about his character.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A1-6&amp;version=CEB&amp;interface=print">James 4:1-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have you ever been to a party and gotten stuck in a conversation with that person? The person who fights to stay stuck in the center of attention? Chances are it felt like that person sucked the life out of the moment. Pride has a way of separating us not only from each other, but from God---thats how it works. Put on your big boy pants, were talking about pride this week.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How was your weekend? Somebody will ask you this today. Instead of bragging about how your weekend was totally epic, humbly highlight one thing you enjoyed and ask that somebody about the best part of their weekend.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 16</a></p>
