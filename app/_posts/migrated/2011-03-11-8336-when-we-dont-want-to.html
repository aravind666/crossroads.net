<p>When We Dont Want To</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to see the deepened relationship that comes from obedience to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway Mark 14:32-42" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:32-42&amp;version=NIV">Mark 14:32-42</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Our world is built around fulfilling desire. Our economy thrives on it, our legal system is built to protect it, and its how many of us operate on a daily basis. In shortwhat we want is often what matters most.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet in the midst of this, do we take notice of the fact that Jesus didnt want to die? He didnt want to suffer all the pain that he knew was ahead of him. But Jesus was driven by relationship, not desire. For Jesus (and where we can follow suit), obedience and respect for the relationship he had with his father carried far more importance than his own personal want.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>God might ask us to do things that we dont want to do. Its in those moments that we have the same choice as Jesus didwill we fight to achieve our desire, or will we pursue a deeper connection with God? Spend some time just talking with God today, strengthening that relationshipmaybe go for a quick walk and focus just on conversation with him. Because the more we know and trust God, the more we will choose obedience over desire.</p>

<p><strong>Week Three Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout this week, weve seen that Jesus didnt always react to things the way that most people would want or expect. Thats a bit easier to swallow when were hearing about other peoples lives, but when its in our own lives, its harder to accept this revolutionary Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there anything youre dealing with in your life where youre resistant to Jesus being revolutionary and working in ways that are beyond your understanding? Ask someone to pray for that area of your life, and ask that same person to check back in with you in a week or so to see how its going.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Reflect back on Jesus conversation with God in Mark 14:32-42, when he revealed that he didnt want to suffer and die. He said his soul was overwhelmed with sorrow. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about the idea that Jesus didnt want to die? What could have been reasons for His dread?</li>
<li>Have you ever felt that God was calling you to die for something, whether that was giving something up, making a commitment or just putting yourself on the back burner? </li>
<li>Do you sense God calling you to anything right now? Ask Him to guide you, and be open to pray the same for others</li>
</ul>
