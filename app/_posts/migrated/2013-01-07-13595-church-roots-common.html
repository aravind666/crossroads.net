<p class="noPspace"><strong>Church Roots: Common</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were looking at the beginning of the Church as described in Acts 2. Focus on verses 44-45 today.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001ZMLmtmCNtZnXrBvinizbExeYlbd67RvqV0-EdMBrFQA12ickfGw22j6bQ5BrCNGsnlQvxWW691LN625_nRh85MXbD1GG4fwazmeAfzl9BdmLHhnsum_ivDIld2XP2T2DrcX61mj91cXNIOeWaeN4GaaVJzJsUYK8FIBmQz65CEC_W1ph2WIqlvd56EihP8HTS4TNGk8VwsU9CXRB6M_uUQ==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Depending on who you are or what you have, this part could be a little overwhelming. If so, take a deep breath. We talked about living a life that springs from an awe of God, yesterday. When we live in awe of how big God is, and all that he is capable of, its easier to begin to open your hands. Open yourself to the concept that it is all Gods anyway, and that he can redistribute it. Opening your hands means being open to the gifts that God wants to give you, and open to God helping you give yourself away.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take a moment today to make a list of gifts God has given you. This could be skills, your degree, your gifts, your talents, your job, your home, your stuff or your family. Then sit with your hands open for several minutes. Let God speak to you about how he wants to give to you, or help you offer up what He has given you.</p>
