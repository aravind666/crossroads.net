After that date, you can leave donations in the wrapped gift boxes youll see as you enter the Auditorium for our Christmas show, <em>Awaited</em>. (By the way, have you gotten <a href="/awaited" title="Get Free Tickets to Awaited">your tickets</a> yet?) If you'd like to talk with someone about a more complicated year-end gift, contact Tait Paul at 513.731.7400 x356.</body></html>
