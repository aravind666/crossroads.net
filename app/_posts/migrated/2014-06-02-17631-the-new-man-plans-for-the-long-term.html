<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Plans for the Long-Term</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will consider what it means for the New Man to have a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to give you strength for the long-haul.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+17%3A1-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 17:1-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Abraham and his wife, Sarah, were an old married couple with no kids. But God promised them a huge family, in fact a nation, if they followed and obeyed him. Thats a pretty big vision and not one that either Abraham or Sarah would see. Like Abe, men think about and plan for the long-haul, not just this weekend. This requires action and patience, and while it wont always be easy (spoiler alert: it will be hard), God keeps his promises.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, instead of planning for the weekend or what to pick up for dinner, spend some time with God and think about your long-term vision. What is it and who is part of it?</p>
