<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Protects the Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to explore what the Bible says about men. This week, well focus on how the New Man is a protector.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to remind you of his protection.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91%3A9-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 91:9-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We all need protection from someone or something. Maybe you remember a school bully or an accident when you were physically unprotected. Whatever it is, God wants us to know that he is our protection from harm when we follow and obey him. That doesnt mean He keeps bad things from happening to us. He actually arms us and gives us the ability to protect ourselves and, most of all, others on our team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of someone you care about. Theres a reason God brought that person to your mind. Today, do something that protects them in a very specific way.</p>
