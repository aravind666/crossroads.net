<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We  often hear this walking-on-water story as a teaching on faith. And it  is, but theres something else to consider about this story. Its  captured in the simple line: "Peter got down out of the boat." Peter moved into the miraculous. His faith wasnt just felt or spoken; it was acted upon. Peter heard, felt and moved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This  week well look at some stories of people who left their seats to  pursue Gods power. As we gear up for the six-week Strong Challenge  where well be incorporating spiritual practices and rhythms into our  lives, its a good time to be reminded that faith is, indeed, something  that moves us. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When has your faith led you to move, even in the smallest of ways?</p>
