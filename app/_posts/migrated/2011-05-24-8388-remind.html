<p><strong>Tuesday, May 24 </strong><br>Remind</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, remind me of the places youve showed up before and what that felt like.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%203:19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 3:19</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Repentance results in times of refreshing. Many stories we can read about Gods people conclude with the building of monuments or celebrating festivals, all designed to remind them of something significant God had done in their midst. And many of these significant things happened after a conscious choice to align themselves with God and his plan for them. (Check out<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Joshua%204:21-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"> Joshua 4:21-24</a> and<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%2028:10-22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print"> Genesis 28:10-22</a>.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So even though repentance isnt supposed to be scary, maybe it still conjures up queasy feelings. Instead of indulging those feelings, now might be a good time to take a look back at some of your monuments: those times in your life when turning toward God led to a time of refreshing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend some time thinking about that one time when you were refreshed. Write down what youre thinking about in as much detail or vaguery as you want, as long as you write something down that you can go back to.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2024&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 24</a></p>
