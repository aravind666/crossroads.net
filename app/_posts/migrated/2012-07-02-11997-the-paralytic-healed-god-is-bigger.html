<p class="noPspace">Happy Independence Day! We have plenty of reasons to celebrate our country. We can also celebrate that God is bigger (even bigger than freedom of speech and sweet fireworks displays).</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>The systems around getting into the pool at Bethesda were broken; this paralytic man couldnt get himself into the therapeutic waters, even if theycouldheal him. So Jesus completely bypassed the system. He didnt even bother with the water--Jesus simply spoke and the man was healed. God is simply bigger than than laws of nature, as well as the rules-based religious systems we create.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Today, ask God to show you where you trust anything more than him. This could be anything--a system, a set of rules, or simply a habit youve followed for years.</p>
