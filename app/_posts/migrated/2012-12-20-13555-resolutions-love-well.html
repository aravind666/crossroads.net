<p class="noPspace"><strong>Resolutions: Love Well</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">All of the resolutions weve discussed so far are connected. For starters, wonder builds faith. Faith in God makes it easier to not need credit from others (humility). Humility makes it easier to give and receive grace. Flowing in grace looks a lot like loving well, which is where we finish off the week. Today, we look at a scripture that is frequently used in weddings, but in a fresh translation. Notice how love includes other things weve grown in this week.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Love is not a fluffy emotion or an obsessive feeling. The feeling can help the human race continue to perpetuate itself and it feels really nice, but its not true love. Love, the kind God intends us to function in, is about viewing people the way God views them, not just in a way that makes us feel better about ourselves.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Stop right now and think of someone that you could show unselfish love toward today. Its okay to choose your spouse, but otherwise steer clear of someone you have feelings for, or someone that it would benefit you to impress.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>

<li>What do you think this year might look like if you continued to make these five things your focus?</li>
<li>Are there any of the five that you got stuck on, and why?</li>
<li>Do you have any other resolutions? Do you think that there could be a connection between these five and other resolutions you might have?</li>
