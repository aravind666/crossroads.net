<strong>Thursday, January 14</strong><br>A Broader Impact<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Proverbs 10<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>While it is important that we choose our friends wisely because of the impact they have on us, the same is true in the other direction. Whether it is laziness, selfishness, deception, or something else entirely, a lack of wisdom in our lives impacts not only us, but those around us as well.<br><br>Yet in the same way, wise choices on our part can have a positive effect on those around us. In moments when we embrace radical love, aggressively pursue reconciliation, and demonstrate selfless generosity, we are choosing a life of wisdom that connects the people around us with the heart of God.<br><ul>
<li>How has a choice youve made impacted the people around you in the past?</li>
<li>Whats one change you could make to become a better, wiser friend?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>This kind of wise, impactful life is within our grasp on a daily basis, but it often eludes us because we are not prepared for it. Think of one or two people (outside of your family) who you interact with on a daily basis. Now take a few minutes and ask God to show you specific actions you can take to help connect them to God. As ideas come to mind, write them in your journal.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK<br></strong>Proverbs 6:20-35<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">If you are new to The Daily, <a style="color: #3a6e8f; text-decoration: none" href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt"><span>   <br><br></span></span>
