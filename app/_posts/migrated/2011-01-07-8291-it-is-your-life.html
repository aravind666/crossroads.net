<p>It Is Your Life</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me continue listening to your wisdom and applying it to my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%204:5-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 4:5-13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Hold on to instruction [wisdom], for it is your life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wisdom doesnt just help your life, or improve it every once in a while. It is your life. And this is because true wisdom comes from your connection to God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So how do we hold on to wisdom (life)? We connect with God, and continue to connect. We listen to His words and we apply that learning to our daily life. And out of that connection comes a more fulfilled, peaceful, alive kind of existence.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of where you are on your spiritual journey, take a few minutes and just talk with God today as you would your closest friend.</p>
