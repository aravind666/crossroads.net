<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong> Yesterdays Daily gave context to the first part of this verse, warning us not to put our  hope in our wealth, which is uncertain, but rather to put our hope in  God, who is steadfast. Today, focus on the second part of this verse,  which describes <em>how</em> God meets our needs when we put our trust  in him: he "richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment." Not  just for our survival or to meet only our bare necessities. <em>For our enjoyment.</em> Similar to yesterdays challenge, take a few minutes to write down and describe as many details as you can of ways youve <em>enjoyed</em> Gods provision. (If you made a list yesterday, that would be a great  place to start.) Your list might include experiences with friends, a  delicious meal or the roof over your head, all of which God has provided  for your enjoyment.</p>
