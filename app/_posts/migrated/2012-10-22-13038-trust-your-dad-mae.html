<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET MAE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"The one thing Im starting to grasp is that God might love me as much when Im failing as when Im succeeding. Thats been the big aha in the last few weeks. Being spiritually parented (discipled) by a real person in my community has revealed to me the gentle, persistent and loving way that God parents me, regardless of what I have to offer him. Having a tangible example in my life of acceptance, being known and loved, but also lovingly taught and corrected, has helped clear up the picture of how God has always loved me. Im more and more aware that, as a daughter, its more comforting for me to obey than not."</p>
