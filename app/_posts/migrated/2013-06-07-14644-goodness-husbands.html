<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodness: Husbands</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish our week and our Good Sex series with a shout-out to husbands.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:25-28&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5:25-28</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Christ made himself one with us through a spiritual act that models the physical act of sex. He made himself one with us by entering us as the Holy Spirit. Christ is the perfect husband to all of the church, but husbands have the not-so-small task of replicating and representing Christ through the way they love their wives. Husbands--invite more of Gods kingdom to this earth through loving your wife well.</p>
