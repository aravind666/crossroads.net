<p><strong>Week 1: Repentance &amp; Receiving</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, May 23 </strong><br>Recalibrate</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to trust that your best for me actually is whats best for me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2030:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 30:15</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Repent might sound like one of those religious buzzwords that reminds some people of all the hoops they thought they had to jump through to get to God. Truth be told, there arent hoops. Not even tiny ones. And repenting isnt scary and isnt meant to riddle us with guilt. It simply means changing your beliefs and choosing to align yourself with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Heres what someone recently said about repentance:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the word repent was a military term meaning stop, turn about-face and march. In the New Testament, its described as changing what you believe--a willful decision. So when I think of repentance, I see it as a recalibration of my heart to Gods. Its like finding true north again. Or tuning my guitar. The closer I get to God, the better everything else sounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God if theres anything in your life that needs changing. Then, just listen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2023&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 23</a></p>
