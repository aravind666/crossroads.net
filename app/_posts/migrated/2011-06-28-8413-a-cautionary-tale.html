<p>A Cautionary Tale</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to stay focused on you, not the worlds version of success. Help me to realize that work isnt about getting more, but about moving towards you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Samuel 11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>David had it all. He was king. He was powerful. He was respected. He had beautiful wives and unimaginable wealth. By every definition the world has, David was a success. But at the height of his success, he experienced his greatest failure, and in a matter of a few short weeks managed to have an affair, murder someone, and turn his back on both his people and his God. He took all the work he had done, and turned it into something grotesque.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some things never change. Turn on the news and youll see celebrities having breakdowns, athletes getting arrested, and billionaires stealing money. Apparently having it all doesnt mean what we think it does.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes and write down your personal version of having it all. Now write down what you think the Kingdom version of having it all might be. How do the two compare?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT </strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5</a></p>
