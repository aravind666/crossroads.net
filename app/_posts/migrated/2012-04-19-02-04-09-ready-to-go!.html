<p class="noPspace">Right now, twenty-two Crossroads volunteers are preparing for travel to Mumbai on this year&rsquo;s first GO India Church Mobilization trip (April 19-29). They will work with Crossover Foundation and our church partners to build into church leaders and their families as they begin the journey of providing aftercare to trafficking survivors, and to rally people as they align with God&rsquo;s heart for justice. Check back here for daily updates throughout the trip!</p>
