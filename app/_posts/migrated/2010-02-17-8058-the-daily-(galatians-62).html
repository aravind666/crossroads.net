<p><strong>Wednesday, February 17<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Burdens</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.<br></em></p>
<p><strong>READ<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%206:2&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 6:2<br></a>(Click to view the scripture online.)<br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Bible regularly uses metaphors to describe what the Church is like. One metaphor thats frequently used is the body: those who follow Jesus are all members of one body, and as a result, we are each dependent upon one another. Just like in our physical body, if one part becomes weak, the other parts of the body will come around it and compensate when possible.</span></strong></p>
<p>We need to help carry one anothers burdens and to see others burdens and shortcomings as affecting us (and the entire body), as well. Were told to come around anyone struggling and give support. Sometimes this demands a big sacrifice. And sometimes its a small gesture with a lasting impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify one person in your life whos really struggling right now. Whats one way you could help carry that burden? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Ask God to help you discern ways you can support that person, and others, in need. Then ask Him to give you the strength and opportunity to follow through.<br></span></strong></p>
