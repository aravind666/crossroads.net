<p><strong>Week 3: The Life of Jesus</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, March 7</strong></p>
<p>Extravagance</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to see my gifts and sacrifices as you see them.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Mark 12:41-44" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012:41-44&amp;version=NIV">Mark 12:41-44</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So Jesus and his disciples sit down to watch people give money at church. (You know it will be entertaining!) After observing things for a while, Jesus points out one woman and praises her to the disciples. But those coins she put in? Worth less than a penny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This woman, who had no retirement, no savings plan, and no one to care for her was willing to give everything she had. And to Jesus, it wasnt the value of the coins that mattered; it was the significance of the sacrifice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It could be easy to hear this story and feel guilty for never having made a big sacrifice. But Jesus isnt interested in us feeling guilt. Hes interested in our freedom. How do you think this woman from this story experienced freedom?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We have nothing we could give that would be worth anything to God (other than our heart). We dont give because God needs something, but because it changes who we are and brings us freedom. Spend a few minutes today asking God how you could give. (And it might not be money.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Acts 20" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2020&amp;version=NIV">Acts 20</a></p>
