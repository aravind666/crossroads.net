<html><body><p>As you probably know, an awful tragedy took place at the first <em>Awaited</em> show, and all other <em>Awaited</em> shows have been canceled. You might not have known that we had a prayer service last night. I'm sorry if you didn't know about it or couldn't attend, because for many of us it was a very powerful experience. <br><br>Just to make sure that everyone has the same information on what's happening here at Crossroads between now and Christmas, here are the details:<br><br><strong>Weekend Experiences at Crossroads Oakley</strong><br>Saturday at 4 and 6pm<br>Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30am<br><br>We will offer childcare at these services for children from birth through fourth grade. All other children or students are welcome to be in the Auditorium. These weekend experiences will bridge a gap between what happened at the first Awaited performance and what will happen at our Christmas Eve experiences. Among other things, I'll be sharing some things I've learned about God, myself and Crossroads. These weekend experiences will have some teaching, and will also leverage music and the arts to the fullest potential in helping all of us experience God. <br><br><strong>Christmas Eve Experiences at Crossroads Oakley</strong><br>Wednesday, December 24 at 11am, 1pm and 3pm<br><br>Services this weekend and on Christmas Eve will be entirely different experiences. Mason folks, we haven't forgotten about you, and we hope that you'll be able to attend services in Oakley. Given the logistics involved with planning services in multiple locations on such short notice, and the lack of time to work out a special arrangement with Mason schools, we'll only be able to have services in Oakley.<br><br>Regardless of your spiritual orientation, I believe that both this weekend and Christmas Eve could facilitate your going to a new place in your understanding (and perhaps even receiving) of Jesus. Feel free to bring friends and family to any of these experiences. <br><br>Jesus was born into difficult circumstances and died under tragic circumstances. The Christmas message is as appropriate as ever to all who would experience it. The grieving family that I spent the entire night with on December 17 has continued to be very adamant in encouraging Crossroads to do whatever we can to offer Christmas experiences that Keri would have wanted to bring her friends to. We'll be doing just that.<br><br>Hope to see you there.</p></body></html>
