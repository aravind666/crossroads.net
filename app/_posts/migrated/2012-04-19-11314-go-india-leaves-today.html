<html><body><p class="noPspace">Right now, twenty-two Crossroads volunteers are preparing for travel to Mumbai on this years first <a title="GO India website" href="/goindia">GO India</a> Church Mobilization trip (April 19-29). They will work with Crossover Foundation and our church partners to build into church leaders and their families as they begin the journey of providing aftercare to trafficking survivors, and to rally people as they align with Gods heart for justice. You can follow along on the trip through our <a title="India Blog" href="/india">India blog</a>.</p></body></html>
