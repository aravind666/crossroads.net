<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Get Your Story Straight</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the last few weeks, The Daily has taken a deeper look at the book of Acts. This week, well finish our study of how its lessons apply to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to remind you of your story.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26%3A12-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 26:12-18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve all got a story to tell, full of good moments and bad. Like Paul, all of the moments can point to how Jesus impacts our lives. He was an angry guy who chased after Jesus followers. And then, bam! Jesus changed Pauls story and purposefully told him to share it with others. That didnt mean forgetting the bad stuff, it meant getting his story straight---the good and the bad---so he could tells others about Jesus in a real, personal way.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You dont have to lose your sight like Paul to have a good story, just a willingness to let Jesus in. Tell part of your story today. Write it down, send it to a friend or meet for coffee and have a real conversation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 26</a></p>
