<p class="noPspace"><strong>Awaited Peace: Personal</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today, we continue to look at how Jesus brought peace, this time through a prophet that lived when Jesus was born. Simeon speaks this prophecy when Jesus is being taken by his parents to be circumcised and dedicated at the temple.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001zu_JiYmHLp5mg5lNIjVEozp8nit3F0tHLFXaYdnRzN_ss_U4UvKhdbTK2kFYjXoLr2zR9xYJxDhsv52leVvLGFOXPctz9R0jI5ksrmQQqkJVba56agHfkiZXunPe98XxlrTId0xZ-acwlF4J-J6DfixwRATv9NH3-AciceRswo3Wpm75pUrxrNGsNf5OWHmJRr1XLuim7132qLrhdIp76Q==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Luke 2:25-32</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Simeon understood waiting. Instead of just fantasizing about the coming Messiah, he lived in true hope and anticipation. Simeon speaks broadly to those in the temple about Jesus identity, but he opens with his own immediate experience of seeing the Messiah with his own eyes. He experiences peace.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Put yourself in Simeons shoes. God has promised to you that you will meet the Messiah. Ask God to reveal his son to you right now.</p>
