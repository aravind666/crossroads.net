(Andy Stanley is the lead pastor at <a href="http://www.northpoint.org/">Northpoint Church</a> near Atlanta.) The book is rooted in the story of Nehemiah and discusses how to uncover and pursue a personal vision. <br>For anyone wanting to stay tuned to what God's saying and act on it, it's a pretty good read and it's great supplemental material to our current <strong>Rebuild</strong> series.</body></html>
