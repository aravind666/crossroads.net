<p>Winter: Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, may you bless me with your deep contentment.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God  has filled us through springs awe, summers work, falls surrender,  and winters contemplation. Like a child just pulled away from mothers  milk, we are full and satisfied. We are at rest in His arms as he  blesses us with deep contentment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>No  matter how strong or independent or proud you feel, let go. Let God  wrap his arms around you. Let Him give you peace that only he can give.  Receive His rest and his hope. When you begin to worry or are distracted  about what is to come, dont go there. Thats another season, even if  that season is later today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right now, declare aloud that your hope is in the Lord.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Picture  the things you worry about as weights that are in your hands. Now  physically lift your hands toward God, and hand that off to God. Thats  it. Hell take it from here.</p>
