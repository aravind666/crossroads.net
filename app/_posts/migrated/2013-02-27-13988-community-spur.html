<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Spur</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue this week to look at listening and acting on what we hear from God, and specifically doing that in community.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:23-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 10:23-25</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">These three verses are filled with tremendous goodies on how to live out our faith in community. Number one: commit to be about the same hope: the hope that is in God who is faithful, instead of a perishable world. Once we all commit to be unified in our hope, encourage and spur on deeds that represent your hope. Lastly, be intentional about meeting so that you can regularly spur and encourage with one hope. When we dont meet regularly with people who help us refocus our hope and our deeds, we end up being easily distracted by what is temporary.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
