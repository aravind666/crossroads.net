<p class="noPspace"><strong>Live Beneath Your Means</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were learning about training money to work for us.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>God, help me to focus on you this week. Please give me a clear mind to receive your wisdom, and an open heart to receive your love. Help me to put You at the center of my week, not the stresses and concerns of money. Amen.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Weve studied this verse in other translations over the past few weeks. The Message paraphrases this verse not as "love of money," but as lust for money. Re-read this verse a few times and consider areas where your unhealthy desire for money might be bringing you trouble. Think about how you might fight that feeling by simplifying or removing something from your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Write down a list of any areas where a "lust for money" is creating stress or problems. Ask God what hed have you do about it. Take at least one real step today toward simplifying or eliminating that area of your life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2019&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">John 19</a></p>
