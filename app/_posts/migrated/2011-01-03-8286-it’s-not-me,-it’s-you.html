<p><strong>Week 2 - Proverbs: Snapshots of Wisdom</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>Monday, January 3</strong></p>
<p>Its Not Me, Its You</p>
<p><br><em>God, show me how my relationships are affecting me.</em></p>
<p><br><strong>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2015:17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 15:17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Ever sat down for a great meal with people you dont really like? Things sort of lose their flavor. You cant relax, you cant open up and be real, you cant seem to enjoy the food on your plate because youre so focused on how your co-eater is bringing you down. And the opposite is true. If in good company, a microwaved bowl of Top Ramen is even satisfying.   How we relate with one another is of far more significance that most of us ever realize. It even affects something as simple as our ability to enjoy a good meal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>Just as our relationships with one another affect something like a meal, so they also impact how we relate to God. Spend a few moments with God today just talking and connecting with him. At some point in your conversation, ask Him to show you relationships in your life that are affecting how you connect with him (whether for good or bad).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2021:19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 21:19</a> (it applies to more than just husbands and wives)</p>
