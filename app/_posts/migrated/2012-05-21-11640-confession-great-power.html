<p class="noPspace"><strong>Confession: Great Power</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Were learning about confession in this final week of our study on the book of James.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>"And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working."</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>James 5:15-16<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001dCz6VJMPFnXtYfc4OnoLeE-O-E6y2QTFv6xY7uNcpgdVzNURequscN6Ca3b2C2XqsF-PlzPgl9j_EAnxa15pyZ25Xwt6kVqZZuB3bWSbFQA-uEtNBQdvU1DQL2HrpRpTSthvCfEKdkeNekNrXka-TVrbGbn4brEESsDaA3P094k2h8FjwT645Q==" target="_blank">(ESV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Confession is like a turbo boost for spiritual growth. It combines everything weve been talking about over the past few weeks: taking action on our faith, undergoing trials, using our tongue and exercising humility. Confession brings us nearer to God and each other.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><a href=""><strong>RESPOND</strong></a></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">We just read about the power of a righteous persons prayer. This week, you can see and learn from that power firsthand. Come pray with our South African friends this Monday through Wednesday, from 8-9am at Crossroads Oakley. Even if you can only make part of that time, itll be worth it.</a></p>
