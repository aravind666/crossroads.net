<p>Hidden Treasure</p>
<p><br><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>

<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally we see shows or hear stories of people who spend their lives and resources chasing legendary hidden treasures. Many years and thousands of dollars are spent to find something that might not even exist. Most of us would see that kind of risk as foolish at best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet, what if you knew the treasure existed, and you knew exactly where it was? The only catch was that you would have to give up everything you have to get it. Would you?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus says that this is a picture of the kingdom God offersit is better than any treasure we can imagine, but it will cost us everything to get it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways is it hard for you to believe that Gods kingdom is worth sacrificing for?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>One of the basic principles about parables is that they are pictures of what Gods kingdom looks like when it is lived out. As a result, we shouldnt be surprised if following God requires sacrifice from time to time. Spend a few minutes asking God if theres anything you need to give up. If you get an answer (or even think you do), act on it.</p>
