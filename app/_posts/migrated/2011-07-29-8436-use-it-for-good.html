<p>Use It For Good</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, keep my heart pure and my tongue humble.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:29-32%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4:29-32</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Ah,  the great and mighty tongue. Made up of sixteen little muscles, its  celebrated as the one of the strongest, most versatile organs in our  body. We know that its power is great and can change the course of lives  around us by simply speaking words. Left to its own nature, though, the  tongue will choose evil, speaking lies and spiritual death. But with  the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the tongue can speak truth and love.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember,  we can try our best to fake it, but the tongue will inevitably show our  true characters. God wants to clean the junk out of our hearts, so that  speaking forgiveness and compassion comes naturally, like fruit. And  before we know it, Super Tongue is using its power for good.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>While  "Sticks and Stones" was a lousy childhood lesson, "think before you  speak" was actually quite brilliant. Even better, lets try asking  before we speak. Today, and as long as you have a tongue, practice  asking God for his input before you open your mouth and unleash that  wild tongue.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 13</a></p>

<p><strong>WEEK TWO DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Do  you have a testimony? Have you written it down or shared it aloud with  others? Why or why not? Each person take turns sharing their God story  for five minutes. Use a timer. Dont worry about how it sounds, just  practice telling your story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider  how you use words in a typical day. Do you talk a lot, or a little?  Why? Whats more challenging for you, growing in the ability to speak,  or growing in the ability to be silent?</li>
<li>Youve  had many assignments over the past two weeks that have required you to  speak aloud. Take turns sharing what youve learned and experienced as a  result of speaking aloud.</li>
<li>Take  a few minutes and practice praying out loud. Each person pray for the  person on their right. Dont worry about what to say or how to say it.  Just speak, and God will use your words to speak life.</li>
</ul>
