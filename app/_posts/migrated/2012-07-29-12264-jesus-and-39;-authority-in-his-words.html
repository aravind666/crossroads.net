<p class="noPspace"><strong>Jesus Authority: In his Words</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today well study the authority of Jesus words, through his healing of the officials son. This is one of the seven miracles (referred to as signs) that John described in his firsthand account.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Jesus healed many, but this healing was unique. It doesnt just show us that Jesus has authority over the physical body and health; it shows the unique power in Jesus words. Jesus didnt even have to travel to the officials son to heal him. He simply spoke and it happened.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong>Take a moment to picture Jesus coming into your space. What words do you think he might say to you?</p>
