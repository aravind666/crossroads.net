<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: The Rules</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to follow the book of Acts and how we can apply its lessons to our own lives. And check out a <strong>Beans and Rice Week</strong> video each day to help you make the most of your meals.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you how to follow him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A10-11&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 15:10-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Every church has a list of official and unofficial traditions or rules. These become such a part of our lives that the idea of not following them seems irresponsible and unsettling. It was the same in the early church. Jesus came and rescued everyone, even those who didnt know the rules existed. Peter (hes the guy Jesus put in charge of the church) made it clear that Jesus came to have a relationship with everyone---the rule followers, the rule breakers and those of us who have never even heard the rules before.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What unofficial church traditions or rules do you put on yourself or others? Spend some time with a blank piece of paper or a journal and think about how these support or take away from your relationship with Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
