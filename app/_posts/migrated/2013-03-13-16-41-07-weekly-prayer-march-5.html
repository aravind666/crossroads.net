<p class="noPspace"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this week’s thoughts.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">God has such big plans for Cincinnati and for Crossroads. Obviously, this gives us a lot to pray about. <span style="line-height: 1.75;">In that spirit, Dani Watkins from CityLink sent us a few stories about some of their clients. Here is one about Phillip:</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>From Dani Watkins:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Phillip came to CityLink to see if it was for real.  He had heard a little about CLC and he wanted to make sure that we were going to do what we said we would do. <span style="line-height: 1.75;">At the end of the orientation, after all of the services had been explained, he was smiling. When asked if there were any questions, Phillip’s hand went up and he said, “I got a question.  You told us about everything you are going to do for us, what can we do for you?” My response: show up and be ready to work.  That’s all it took.</span></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;"> </span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Phillip, to date, has taken just about every class we have offered at CityLink. He attended the job readiness workshop and actively and aggressively searched for a job. In the meantime, he was working on improving his computer skills, attending counseling sessions, and taking GED classes. Due to his high level of commitment, Phillip recently got a job with Great American Ballpark.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em> </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noPspace"><em>He attributes his success to the following things:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="line-height: 1.75;">The service coordinators that he works with have been a great connection for him. He doesn’t feel judged; it’s a place where he can truly be himself  Phillip said that he is in the process of a “makeover”, and CityLink has played a major role in this. </span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="line-height: 1.75;">He is constantly trying to change his heart and thoughts and he feels a strong connection with his service coordinators has helped him in making better decisions. He has said that without these relationships he would be in a very different place right now.</span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Phillip has committed to CityLink for 1 year to see where it takes “US” and to see full life change. He is hoping that God continues to move in his life and help him to keep going.  </span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="line-height: 1.75;">We are celebrating with Phillip 2 years of sobriety, secured and stable housing, and a new job that starts March 5 with Great American Ballpark.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please pray for Phillip and all of the clients currently in the process at CityLink, including those on the waiting list. Pray blessings on CityLink and their mission.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
