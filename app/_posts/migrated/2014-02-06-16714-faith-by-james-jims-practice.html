<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Faith by James: Jims Practice</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jims practice is ongoing, but he has chosen to suffer well, leaning in to a Father who loves him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Ask God to train you for the life he has planned.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JIMS PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I have been a smoker for the last 15 years and I have spent more years smoking than I have not. That is tragic when you think about it. Regardless, I am at a place in my life where I believe I need to change. Maybe God has softened my heart, maybe it is just time or maybe my priorities look different, but the most important part for me is having a desire to change.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ive tried to quit smoking before. Usually at a point when I felt like I failed or everything in my life was out of control. I would say to myself, Just fix this one thing and then you can get right again. The problem is I am broken. It has taken me some time to learn this, but I know that by myself I am inadequate. I try giving it my best effort and fail.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Over the past year or so I have found that in my failure there is something I am missing. If quitting is about me and my abilities, I am not strong enough to beat this by myself. Stated differently, I have no track record for success when it comes to discipline in this area of my life and a lot of others if I am honest. If I want this to be a personal fight between me and smoking, I know what will happen. But if I want to frame this challenge as a spiritual test it can look different. I can have hope.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Where does this leave me? I know I want to change. I know it is going to be hard for me, my wife, my coworkers and friends. I know that in my own abilities I am not up for the challenge. But God is in control and has the power to do something I cannot. So I am going to take some action steps and ask God to fill in where I cannot. I am going to stop buying cigarettes and stop acting like the next cigarette will be there. I am going to drop my pride down a few notches and tell God every time I want to smoke and hope that he will relieve my craving. I want to suffer through this so I know what it is to be obedient to God instead of being obedient to my desires. I want to be trained out of this. I want to treat my body like Gods temple. I dont know how this story will end, but I trust God will train me if I ask Him. I suppose that is all I really want in life---to have my Father hear me when I cry out to Him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If youre ready for something to change in your life, whats one simple action step you can take to make that happen? Like Jim, remember to bring God alongside your suffering.</p>
