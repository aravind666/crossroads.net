<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/legacy/content/ConsumedBanner.jpg" alt="Consumed Journey banner" title="Consumed Journey banner" width="441" height="67"><br><br>Consumed was an all-church journey that explored what it means to be consumed by God instead of materialism, and how to live more generously with both time and money.  It's been three months since the official end of the journey, but Consumed continues to touch lives. This week, we'll be sharing stories from people in our community.<br><br><strong>Cecelia's story:<br>I</strong> was on medical leave from a stressful job, and just found out that my disability insurance would not cover me.  I heard a weekend message about accepting help. Through the <a href="../corkboard" target="_blank" title="Crossroads Corkboard">Corkboard</a> I met someone who lent me $200. Once I submitted to God and asked for help, more help came, by means of free car repairs, money for gas and other gestures, many unsolicited. <br><br>While trying to raise more money, I tried to have a yard sale—it rained. I realized God was telling me to give my things away, even in the midst of my need. So I found people on the Corkboard and gave away my possessions, forming new relationships in the process.<br><br>I still didn’t have a job and needed a place to live. Again I reached out to my community  at Crossroads via the Corkboard and found free rent in exchange for working for the landlord. Now, I have a job with half the hours of the old job, and I’m able to spend quality time with my son. <br><br>If you would have told me a year ago that I would be reaching out to a church community to meet my needs, I would have laughed. Now, I have a sense of belonging and purpose through being in community at Crossroads. <strong><br><br></strong>
