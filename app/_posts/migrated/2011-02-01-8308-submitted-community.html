<p>Submitted Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway ephesians 5:21" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%205:21&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 5:21</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If youre reading this in America, then youre probably fairly well indoctrinated on the idea that in any relationship theres a dominant party and a submissive party. And to win, you need to be on the dominant end of the equation. Alpha males, Type A leaders, CEOs--our culture celebrates the individual who bucks the system, makes his own way, and is beholden to no one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only problem is, our culture isnt the Kingdom, and its not what God envisioned within the Body of Christ. In Ephesians, were commanded to submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Mutual submission isnt something thats popular, but in a healthy community its essential. By intentionally saying, Friend, I give you permission to speak into my life, and I need you to help me see things I cant see myself, youre submitting to your community in reverence to Christ. Thats a beautiful and mysterious Kingdom idea, but it has powerful ramifications for the community of people around you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever considered laying your life before your friends, and giving them the permission to speak words of encouragement, love, and correction to you? Does the idea seem scary or ridiculous? If so, consider why you have that reaction. Could it be that youre following the cues of culture vs. the Kingdom? Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal a person (or people) to submit yourself to, and then do it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway mark 12" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2012&amp;version=NIV">Mark 12</a></p>
