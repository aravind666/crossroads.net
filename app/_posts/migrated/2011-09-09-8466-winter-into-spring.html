<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Winter  has been cold and dark, even in its moments of growth, surrender and  deepening. But its over. Our Lord, our Love, calls to us. He calls us  to follow Him, and he beckons us to rise up from the ground. He makes  all things new. He calls to us, and our answer can be yes. And when our  answer is yes, its not because we must, but because He is too amazing  to resist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Crocuses  are the first flowers in our city to come up. Declare today Crocus Day.  Winter is over and spring is come. Celebrate how God is making you new.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  these questions and write down your answers: What is God is making new  in you? Or what is something He wants to make new in you? Thank God for  loving you and tending to you.</p>

<p><strong>Week Four Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Winter  is a time of growth and maturing. You cant skip over it; you must  learn to wait and hope. We mature into Christs nature by walking  through death or surrender, and then hoping even through death that He  will resurrect. Having depth to our faith through hope is a masterpiece  to God. Share that with your community.</p>
<ul>
<li>With all seasons covered, name where you are now and how long you have been in that season.</li>
<li>Is there anything in your life that you still need to mourn and then hand over to the Lord in hope?</li>
<li>Do  you think that you have rushed seasons in your faith, or skipped, or  remained stuck? Ask your community what they think would help you grow.</li>
<li>Share  a meal together in celebration of the "seasons of faith," acknowledging  that each is necessary for us to grow and be fruitful. During this  meal, encourage one another in the season that they are in.</li>
</ul>
