<p>Generosity Yields Refreshment</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to ask God to meet with you today. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2011:25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 11:25</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>When we put ourselves in the flow of what God is doing in the world, we experience benefits that we wouldnt experience otherwise. When we are generous, we often receive more in return than what we gave. This doesnt necessarily mean money or things; its often something more significant and eternal.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Ask God to help you recall a time in your life when your generosity yielded refreshment.</p>
<p></p>
