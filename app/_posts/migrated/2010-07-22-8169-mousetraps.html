<p>Mousetraps</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to ask God for his guidance today.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mousetraps havent changed much since Jesus taught us this prayer. You would think that mice would start avoiding the traps after some time, but cheese is tempting. And we all have our brand of cheese.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As James wrote, God does not lead us into sin. He doesnt tempt anyone or try to set the trap while were not looking. So, this part of the prayer may be better understood as asking God to lead us away from temptation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everyone is tempted. Even Jesus was directly tempted by Satan. But He was delivered away from it, and we, too, can ask for and receive deliverance.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever felt like God led you away from temptation, whether that happened through another person or as an unexpected distraction? Thank Him for that deliverance.</p>
