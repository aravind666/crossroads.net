<p>Trust vs. Impulse</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: God, its hard not to rely on merely my own thoughts and opinions. Teach me to follow only you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2017:24-27&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 17:24-27</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>At first glance, this is a strange story. On a second or third glance it might be, as well. Maybe youre asking if Peter already knew that Jesus had paid the tax when he answered, or why the explanation about kings and sons, or whats the deal with coins inside fish?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peter has spontaneous faith. In a previous story, we saw how he gets out of the boat. Unfortunately, in this situation, his impulsiveness leads him to lie. He doesnt know if Jesus has paid the tax. Peter just wants to get on with the exciting business of ministry with Jesus. So, he blows off the tax collector without really knowing the answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus takes this moment to discipline Peter. He doesnt humiliate or scold, but gently puts him back on track. Hes saying that our Father, the king of the universe, doesnt require us to pay him a tax--but while were visiting this other kingdom, follow its rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he calls Peter back to his roots. Peter was a fisherman who left to follow Jesus call. Jesus reminds him of this. He doesnt just do a fish and coin magic trick. He takes Peter back to his original calling and moment of trust, and then bolsters his faith once again in a sweet, personalized way.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If youve chosen to trust God, take a minute to remember that moment, and let it inspire your trust today.</p>
