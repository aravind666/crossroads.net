<p>Bread</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Jesus, help me to hear what you say about prayer, and then help me actually do it.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:1-4&amp;version=NIV">Luke 11:1-4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If you had the chance to learn directly from Jesus how to pray, would you take it? Thats exactly what the disciples did. And Jesus gave them a prayer thats about 30 words long. Thats it. No fancy <span id="shorten_0" title="get-all-dressed-up-and-make-a-big-show-out-of-it">get-all-dressed-up-and-make-a-...</span> experience. Jesus taught that we can connect with God without a show. (Which was pretty radical at the time.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dont be fooled though: theres a lot packed into those words. Jesus prayer shows us that God is so concerned for us that hes focused on what we eat on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, God is concerned about his advancing Kingdom. God cares about the individual basics, but he also cares about spreading the news of who he is and what hes done.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>This prayer is often called The Lords Prayer and many of us have learned it along the way. Whether this is your first time praying it or 10,000<sup>th</sup>, today, take your time saying each line. Specifically think about what it means to get your daily bread and be forgiven.</p>
