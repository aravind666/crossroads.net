<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Abraham is epic. Lets look at him today while thinking of him as our own great-great-grandfather. #epicgp #whosyourdaddy</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2011:8-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:8-10</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Abraham left his family and all that he knew and followed God to a a beautiful but uninhabited land. When he got there, he could have set about creating a house or even a city for his family to live in forever, since God promised it to him and all of his generations--right? Abraham decided that setting the mindset of his family in eternity was a better place to start a generational city, so his family lived in tents for three generations. Abrahams long-term vision wasnt just housing foundations, but solid spiritual ground to build a family and a nation on.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Where are you jumping into worldly markers of achievement (like houses or other material goods) when God wants to build spiritual foundations in you? (hint: where are you suffering?)</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 12</a></p>
