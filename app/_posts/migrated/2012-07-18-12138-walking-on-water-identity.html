<p class="noPspace">Thursday, July 19<strong>Walking on Water: Identity</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">At least five times in his book, John calls himself "the one whom Jesus loved." If you called yourself this, how might it impact the way you receive Jesus response in this story?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001GhKelci1DuvwobgIeEg7A8X5CbyCXBFZQ8H3pVmpWh7gEJUmILBgQI1l1hy5fzJRnltpZnzioKXnzAwCzuCVoNTVK3jIH72-V_72CFFMedspRROv5Tpn6FyEoy6V1Zl24KCeSsMFEbxnR9wc9yDLoJncVOqFjVSuljmKSMgdJF7gIWRAFJtUYZU0wNXk0uDFQbBugXfuFsHAJoD1g9X4Lw==" target="_blank">John 6:18-21</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>John and the rest of the disciples are invited to understand both Jesus full identity, and their own identities. When Jesus says, "It is I," this could also be translated "I AM"--Gods name for himself. Jesus is inviting John to understand that he is God in the flesh. He has also just given a sign of this by walking on the water; He has authority over creation. When you combine Johns understanding of Jesus with John knowing that he is the one that Jesus loves or treasures, something really miraculous happens. John lets Jesus in the boat--and the boat arrives safely and immediately at its destination.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>If its difficult for you to let God into your struggles, that simply means you are human. Like John did, take time today to let the Father tell you how he sees you and who he is. Just close your eyes and listen.</p>
