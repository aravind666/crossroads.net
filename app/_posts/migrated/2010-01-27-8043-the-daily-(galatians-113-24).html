<p><strong>Wednesday, January 27</strong><br>Transformed <br><br><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Galatians 1:13-24<br><br><strong><br>REFLECT</strong><br>Paul was the Big Man on Campus. He wrote much of the New Testament, started many of the first church communities, and is considered one of the most influential Christ-followers to have ever lived. But before all of that, he was a self-righteous Jewish religious leader who hated and tortured Christ-followers. He was a huge threat to the early churchbut God didnt write him off. <br><br>The experience that Paul describes in Galatians 1:13-24 is a radical, personal transformation. Jesus had invaded his life. And this radical transformation is what happens when Jesus crashes into our hearts. It may not look as outwardly dramatic as it did in Pauls life, but Jesus desire is that we would be continually transformed into the people God created us to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>If youve known someone whose life has been transformed by Jesus, what was it like to witness that change? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Think about a way that Jesus has transformed you. Make a mental list of the before and after. </li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Thank Jesus for any ways that youve already experienced his transformation in your life, and ask him to transform a thought, behavior or pattern thats troubling you.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Acts 9:1-31</p>
