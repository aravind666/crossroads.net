<p>Moving in Circles</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God for the faith to follow him, no matter where he leads you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever feel like God is leading you in circles?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every  Christ-follower experiences seasons when theres no forward progress.  In times like these, faith is a continual choice to trust, obey and keep  walking with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Israel  faced an enormous challenge in conquering the walled city of Jericho.  We dont know for sure how high the walls were, but estimates range  between 15 to 50 feet. Usually when an army laid siege to a walled city,  the strategy was a frontal assault. But Gods instructions were quite  different: "Dont even give a war cry, just walk around the city."</p>
<p></p>
<p>If  you were given these strange instructions, would they have been easy to  follow? Would fear, frustration or doubt lead you to tweak the battle  plan or abandon it altogether?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Talk  to God about any place you feel like hes leading you in circles. What  do you need from Him in order to trust and obey? Ask Him for what you  need.</p>
