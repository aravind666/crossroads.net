<p>Journals</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p><br><br><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2018:16-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 18:16-19</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Some books of the Bible were written mainly by the Old Testament kings as books of praise, poetry, wisdom and literature. Books like Job, Psalms, Proverbs, and Song of Songs fit this category. We get a journal-style, intimate look into the thought life of God followers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>King David wrote most of Psalms, and Proverbs is filled with wise sayings written mainly by King Solomon. Both are great books to go to for wisdom and to find out how to pray, worship and connect with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Although Psalm 18 is David speaking, can you read the verse and feel how it is true for you today? In what way has the Lord ever brought you into a spacious place?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p>Open to anywhere in the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-International-Version-NIV-Bible/#books">Psalms</a> and read a chapter.</p>
