<p>Dancing Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=2%20Samuel%206:13-15&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Samuel 6:13-15</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAKE ACTION</strong></p>
<p>You guessed it. Were dancing today. Men, before you move on to your next email, observe who danced before God with all his might: David. That would be King David, the same man who is celebrated for killing tens of thousands, the mighty warrior poet, the kid who killed Goliath with a single shot. Men, David is as guys guy as youll find in scripture, yet its recorded on multiple occasions that he loved to dance before God with reckless abandon. So were going to do the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The song doesnt matter (neither do the moves). Today were worshipping God with our whole bodies. At some point today--now would be great--find some privacy and some speakers. Ask the Holy Spirit for the courage (and joy) to dance like David danced, then turn on the music, turn yourself towards God, and go for it.</p>
