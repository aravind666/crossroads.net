<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><br><strong>Tuesday, November 24</strong><br>A Mystery Revealed<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>READ<br></strong>Ephesians 3:1-12<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>It seems that God had more at work all along than people knew, all of it coming together in this plan to restore all of humanity through Jesus. God has been intimately involved in the world throughout history, continually choosing people to be the demonstration of his heart to the world. Yet Paul is saying here that all of that work was simply the buildup to what He was doing through Jesus, and that this is the mystery that is unfolding in due time.<br><br>Often, Gods timing is often far different from our own. As a result, we often have a tendency to either run ahead of God and try to make things happen on our own, or to think that God has deceived us and isnt keeping his promises.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever tried to run ahead of God and make things happen on your own? What happened?</li>
<li>In what areas is it hard for you to wait on the mystery of Gods plan to unfold? Whats one thing you can do to be more patient in that area?</li>
</ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Spend a few minutes thanking God for the redemption that he offers you through Jesus, and ask him to show you how to be more patient in areas where you need it. Ask Him to help you rest and be content in the purpose he has for you today.</body></html>
