<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Carry On: Blessings Focused</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week we are continuing to look at keeping or protecting our rhythms. Read the passage today, and then reread the second sentence.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20116:7-8&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Psalm 116:7-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we struggle to set rhythms of rest in our life and then keep them, it can be because we are focusing on what isnt, instead of what is. We see all that needs to be done, or all that we desire to earn, or all that we want to become. When we switch the focus from there to what God has already done and given and formed in us, resting is easier.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take one minute and list all that you need or want to do today. Now, thank God for entrusting you with all of this.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 21</a></p>
