<p>If you teach in a ministry area at Crossroads (Community Groups, Kids' Club, CSM), you&rsquo;re invited to the Teacher&rsquo;s Class to learn and practice the skills of effective communication. You&rsquo;ll also learn a simple method for reading the Bible for application. The class meets four consecutive Thursdays: January 28, February 4, 11, and 18 from 6:30-8:30pm at the Oakley campus.</p>
<p>You must be able to attend all sessions, as space is limited. Sign up today by <a title="Email Us" href="http://www.crossroads.net/mysend/131">sending us an email</a>.</p>
