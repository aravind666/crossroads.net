<p class="noPspace"><strong>Awaited Joy: Unexpected</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Its week two of Advent, the four weeks leading up to Christmas. Last week we looked at hope through Old Testament prophecies. This week, well focus on the way Jesus brought unexpected joy. Traditionally, Advent uses five candles: one for each week of the Advent season, and one for Christmas morning. If you want to use candles, light two this week as a sensory reminder of the hope and joy that Jesus brought into the world.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you could imagine how God would redeem mankind and heal the broken relationship going all the way back to Eden, would you have pictured a young soon-to-be-married teenage girl birthing a baby in a barn? Would you imagine that the savior and deliverer would come as a baby, and grow up to be humiliated on the cross?Its a crazy story, weighted with surprise and tragedy, that leads to the richest joy we can experience. Isaiah, written 700 years before Jesus, begins to hint that the promised Messiah may not look like anyone expected. Joy frequently doesnt.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Remember a time in your life that you experienced joy in an unexpected way. Journal about it.</p>
