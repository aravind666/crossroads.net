<br><strong>Friday, November 20</strong><br>From Separation to Belonging<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.<br></em><strong><br>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 2:11-18<br><br><div>
<br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Separated. Left out. Not included. These words can be depressing, and sound uncomfortably familiar. <br><br>Were you the one not chosen for kickball until very last? Were you the one who felt you didnt belong in your family? <br><br>In a spiritual sense, we were all left out. We were excluded, without hope, far away, and without God.<br><br>But then Jesus reconciled us to God. And when we say yes to following him, we join his chosen people. We are included. Family. Jesus made peace with usand its more than just quiet or the absence of conflict.<br><br>This is the peace of knowing you belong fully. Jesus himself picked us. We dont need to force our way inbecause of His actions, we are chosen. <br><ul>
<li>If you believe this is true, how does it change how you view yourself?</li>
<li>How does this change how you view others?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask Jesus for his peace. Consider (or write in your journal) anything that is a barrier to receiving that peace. If you have any doubts about your belonging, share those with God. If it helps you to do so, state out loud that you do belong because of what Jesus did. Ask God to help you experience the peace of belonging.</div>

<br>____________________________________<br><br><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong><br>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.<br><br>This week began with a greeting of peace and ended with a description and claim of peace (2:14).<br><ul>
<li>Based on what you experienced in your time with God this week, how would you define this kind of peace?</li>
<li>Have you had an experience of this? How have you experienced peace during this week?</li>
<li>In what ways would you like to experience more peace in the coming week?</li>
</ul>We read a lot this week about how God has chosen us, freed us, and given us hope and power through Jesus. The response to these gifts in Ephesians often includes the words praise or thanks.<br><ul>
<li>What have you seen or experienced that would spark praise and thanks this week? Jot down a few things and share them with someone else.</li>
<li>Hope and power come from our connection with God. In what ways would you like to know God more?</li>
</ul>
