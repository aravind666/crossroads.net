<p>Christmas: A Fathers Gift</p>
<p></p>
<p><br><strong>READ </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%209:2-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 9:2-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><br><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Today we begin a three-week look at Christmas from the perspective of God the Father. The story of Jesus birth can be told from many different perspectives: Mary and Josephs, the shepherds, the wise mens or the nation of Israels. Yet, God the Father is the author of Christmas, and in sending his son Jesus, he made good on his promise to redeem us from sin and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Isaiah, a prophet of Israel 700 years before the birth of Jesus, wrote about rejoicing at the future coming of a child. The advent of this child (advent means coming) is the fulfillment of Gods promise. With the passion of a dad caring for his kids, God, our perfect father, yearns to provide us with a bountiful life. He declares through Isaiah that we will need the coming of his own son, Jesus, to deliver us from death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Christmas approaches, do you feel exhaustion or sadness or just moderate enthusiasm? Or do you rejoice over Jesus redeeming your life?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>Ask God to open your heart to eagerly rejoice over who Jesus was, is, and will be for you.</p>
