<html><body><p>The Reset Prayer Experience is going on now at Crossroads Oakley. It's designed to be a simple, personal prayer journey with an audio guide to
help you engage with God. It's great for those who have never prayed,
or for those who pray everyday. It's designed to last about an hour,
but you can take as much time as you'd like.<br><br><a href="/reset/prayerexperience.htm" title="Reset Prayer Experience">Click here for Prayer Experience hours and details</a>.<br></p></body></html>
