<p class="noPspace"><strong>Awaited Freedom: Redemption</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today is the last day of Advent for the Daily, and we continue to look at freedom.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001YgWGsPIi4f_uE5luF25jW-iFPcPjBEUBBkHOzNHZSe5EupmsDhOzceyt6tbrQG-rsRR3C2EvZNrJGx7HuUNzV5ixL_tgy_qPbQzSzmcmPzCd_zYMPOEJK8htTctuHN9MG08OF6p7Y_Kv5qZVkbN_PT_oc13gOZXwQzjrh75an_5rit9N5OhJw6PIrx2Nnnc2ZopAtUvuS0olD8K3Ghw9kg==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Luke 1:68-69</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This is the beginning of a song sang by Zechariah, John the Baptists dad. John has just been born, and Jesus is still in Marys womb. Zechariah knows that his son Johns path is intertwined with Jesus, and indeed John is the final prophet pointing the way to the Messiah. Redeemed is the word Zechariah uses. Redeemed, in this instance, refers to the way that Gods people have been under false ownership, and how Jesus has come to take them back. Redemption is the best type of freedom, and we all have the opportunity to step out of slavery and into Gods arms.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Get involved in redemption by finding something you can repurpose in your house, and giving it away. Use tools or craft supplies to make something new, make cookies with items already in your pantry, or give away music. You figure it out, but make something new. Thats what Gods doing with you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the meaning of the word freedom, come to a consensus on the meaning.</li>
<li>Admit one way that you arent experiencing freedom right now and then pray for each other. Are you worrying? Are you stressed? Are you in debt? Are you feel trapped? Are you afraid?</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
