<p class="noPspace">In the August blog, we highlighted some important steps the Justice Team has been taking to build a sustainable aftercare infrastructure in India. One key component of this infrastructure is the mobilization of our secret weaponthe local Indian churchinto a long-term social support structure for rescued survivors of sex trafficking. That was the focus of our two GO trips to Mumbai in July.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Our Crossroads team of 23 volunteers joined forces with the Crossover Foundation and partner Maharashtra Baptist Society (MBS) to unite, inform and engage the local church community. The first initiative was hosting a two-day conference where Crossroads volunteers and MBS pastors exchanged ideas regarding worship, childrens ministry, pastoral counseling and how Christ-followers can be mobilized to serve.<br class="pagebreak">Two other initiatives were hosting conferences for 50 women and pastors wives, as well as for 300 young adults from MBS churchessome of whom traveled over three hours to attend. Conference participants said that the testimonials of the Crossover staff, Crossroads team and MBS pastors opened their eyes to the injustice and abuse suffered by so many in their own city. Some volunteered to serve as witnesses on IJM rescue operations, and others pledged to build awareness in their churches and communities.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Our team also saw firsthand how our partners are engaged in their community. Crossroads volunteers paired up with MBS pastors to take prayer walks and visit families in impoverished neighborhoods where the church is ministering. Pastor Biju Thampy, founder of partner organization Vision Rescue, invited the team to visit what will soon be the first transitional home in greater Mumbai for young women over 18 who are survivors of sex-trafficking. The team prayed in each room for the transformation of the women who will live in the home. The team also visited and prayed at the construction site of Vision Rescues Dream Centre, where a 96-bed aftercare home is being built and other facilities are planned.</p>
<p class="noPspace">The success of these two trips is evident in the deepening of our partners involvement. These trips are allowing us to leapfrog forward to engage local churches to respond to aftercare needs, said Don Gerred. MBS has begun the process of forming a new trust so they can register to operate aftercare and transitional homes. With the help of Crossover Foundation, they are already identifying potential locations.</p>
<p class="noPspace">The tasks before us may seem daunting, but the Bible reminds us to not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God (Philippians 4:6). MBS leader Pastor Vivian Fernandes challenged us all to build a foundation with pillars of prayer when he said, When we work, we work; when we pray, God works. We ask for prayer that God will continue to bless our endeavors in India, and ignite the local church to help change the game for rescued girls.</p>
