<p>Wasting Away</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, teach me that confession brings freedom in my relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2032&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 32</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Ever tried to keep a secret? It often just eats away at you, bit by bit. Especially if that secret is about something youve done. Something wrong. Something you dont want others to know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bit by bit, day by day it consumes us. We are wracked with fear and guiltworried and terrified about what will happen if someone finds out. Yet God never intends for us to live this way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All we have to do is go to Him, and it is forgiven.</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a few minutes to think back on something that God has forgiven of you (which is anything youve asked him to forgive). It is easy for us to feel relief for our forgiveness, but we dont often rejoice over it. Thank God for his forgiveness, and ask him to help you celebrate it today.</p>
