<p class="noPspace"><strong>Focus Your Pleasure Spending</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were looking at how we can put money to work for us, not the other way around.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God, help me to focus on you this week. Please give me a clear mind to receive your wisdom, and an open heart to receive your love. Help me to put You at the center of my week, not the stresses and concerns of money. Amen.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This verse highlights Gods generosity, and also the importance of putting him first. When you think of your disposable income as a gift from God, how might that affect your spending and the attitude behind it?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Consider any extra money you can spare this week, even if thats only a few dollars, and how you might "put it to work" for your enjoyment. When your hope is in God, you can freely spend that extra income, knowing that he "richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment."</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2018&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 18</a></p>
