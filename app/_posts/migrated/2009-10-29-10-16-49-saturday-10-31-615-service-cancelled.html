<p>Because one of the main purposes of our weekend services is to provide a place to bring friends who might have given up on church, but not on God, and because Halloween festivities this Saturday evening will occupy most of our friends and neighbors, <strong>we’ve decided to cancel the 6:15pm service on Saturday.</strong> Trick-or-treat night can be a great opportunity to connect with neighbors, and we want to emphasize the importance of those relational connections, even above and beyond attending a church service.<br><br>While we realize not everyone wants to participate in Halloween festivities, we don’t want to participate in pulling people out of their neighborhoods on a rare evening when people interact with each other instead of their televisions.<br><br>We’ll see you (and maybe your friends) at the 4:30 on Saturday in Oakley, or any Sunday service in Oakley or Mason this weekend. (Don’t forget the time change Saturday night so you don’t show up an hour early on Sunday.)<br></p>
