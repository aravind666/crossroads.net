Because one of the main purposes of our weekend services is to provide a place to bring friends who might have given up on church, but not on God, and because Halloween festivities this Saturday evening will occupy most of our friends and neighbors, <strong>we&rsquo;ve decided to cancel the 6:15pm service on Saturday.</strong> Trick-or-treat night can be a great opportunity to connect with neighbors, and we want to emphasize the importance of those relational connections, even above and beyond attending a church service.<br /><br />While we realize not everyone wants to participate in Halloween festivities, we don&rsquo;t want to participate in pulling people out of their neighborhoods on a rare evening when people interact with each other instead of their televisions.<br /><br />We&rsquo;ll see you (and maybe your friends) at the 4:30 on Saturday in Oakley, or any Sunday service in Oakley or Mason this weekend. (Don&rsquo;t forget the time change Saturday night so you don&rsquo;t show up an hour early on Sunday.)<br /><h3><a href="../my/about/serviceTimes.php" title="Service Times &amp; Directions">Service Times &amp; Directions</a></h3>
