<p class="noPspace">Through our work with IJM, we knew that the fight to assure safety and security for survivors of sex trafficking didn’t end with their rescue, but that survivors needed hope to overcome their trauma. The initial focus of our India initiative was to win that battle for hope by investing in the quantity and quality of aftercare homes for rescued survivors. We needed feet on the ground to engage and partner with local churches in the building, staffing and operation of quality aftercare homes. Indian law requires the establishment of a non-governmental organization (NGO) to gain the rights to administer aftercare to trafficked victims. That major step was accomplished in the last month, with Crossover Foundation’s official registration as an NGO.</p>

<p class="noPspace">In last month’s blog, we highlighted some of the amazing work the Crossover Foundation is already doing in India. But this month, we wanted to step back a bit and share the amazing story of hard work, passion, perseverance and prayer that led to the formation of this remarkable foundation funded by our Game Change campaign.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">From the beginning, we knew what we wanted to do in India. We understood that we needed someone remarkable to lead our efforts on the ground—someone who had the competency, diplomacy, integrity and faith required for such an ambitious venture. It would have to be the perfect marriage—and with God’s intervention, a perfect marriage is exactly what He delivered (quite literally). Don Gerred knew Ramona Dsouza through her work with social enterprise NGOs. He asked about her plans for the future, and she introduced him to her husband Keith, a top executive at one of India’s leading ad agencies.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In December 2010, Keith and Ramona traveled halfway around the world to spend time getting to know Crossroads, our vision for India and commitment to changing the game. The Dsouzas and Crossroads team prayed together and discussed a shared vision for real success in India. Then, Keith took a leap of faith—leaving the security and prestige of his job, and “stepped out of the boat” into what he felt God was calling him to do with people he had just met. Keith and Ramona committed to building an organization that would seek to restore, renew and reinstate survivors of trafficking to “crossover” into freedom. Ramona strongly believes, “As long as the Spirit of the Lord is upon us, we can do anything. He will strengthen us; He will set them free and mend their lives.”</p>

<p class="noPspace">Since January, Crossover Foundation has grown from two to eight, has developed significant partnerships with local churches, church leaders and social enterprise agencies, has identified locations for building quality aftercare homes, and has explored working with existing aftercare homes to improve their quality and effectiveness. “We’re trying to do something that’s much bigger than just run five aftercare homes,” says Don. “We’re trying to start a fire.”</p>
