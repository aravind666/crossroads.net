Thanksgiving Food Drive boxes for their families wrote to say thanks.
Here is a sampling of their notes:<br><br><strong>Israel Baptist Church</strong><br><em>"Year after year, you continue to pour out your love upon those who truly need it, and we cannot thank you enough."</em><br><br><strong>Body of Christ Deliverance Church</strong><br><em>"We thank God that you enabled our ministry to bless so many needy families."</em><br><br><strong>Mission of Love</strong><br><em>"Thank you for all your help, that we can help other people in need..."</em><br><br>Thanks for giving generously to bless those in need in our community!</body></html>
