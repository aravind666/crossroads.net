<p>Prayer is Passionate</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me identify and tear down the walls I put up around prayer.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2020:%207-18&amp;version=NIV">Jeremiah 20:7-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is passionate. If you look at prayers in the Bible (like Jeremiahs), you wont see many conversations with God that are muttered under the breath or sound limited by rules. When Gods followers talk with him, they are heartbroken, terrified, excited, hopeful, desperate, broken, angry and celebratory. In other words, they are themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we approach God fully, with all our brokenness and goodness mixed together, we find true conversation and relationship with him. It is during this passionate and authentic communication with God when we are the most known, the most at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Look back at the list of barriers you wrote on Monday. Has God given you perspective on any of those areas in recent days? Any new insights or things you hope for?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7</a></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>This week weve looked at a few descriptions of prayer: authentic, challenging, refreshing, passionate. Maybe some rang true for you; maybe some came as a surprise.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>What was your experience with prayer as a child or young adult? Do you see any ways those play out in your prayer life today?</li>
<li>Whats one way youd like to experience prayer that youre not currently finding? How will you make your way towards that? (The answer might be asking God for help, or just diving into a new way of praying, like no holding back or praying out loud in the car.)</li>
</ul>
