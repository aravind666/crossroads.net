<p class="noPspace">We are continuing this week to look at Jesus teaching on resources. We are looking at a longer section today, involving the role of our eyes.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:19-23&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 6:19-23</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">What do you keep your eye on? If you have a child you know you need to keep your eye on them. If you have stocks you keep your eye on the NASDAQ. If you love fashion, you notice what people wear. If you love a sport, you know the scores. What magazines or books do you read? What media do you consume?</p>

<p class="noPspace">We have taken time this week to notice our resources, but how are we investing one of our key resources: where we put our eyes? The amount of time we place our eyes on certain things will affect our heart. Curating our time and what our eyes see is the first step toward using your resources well. Notice that the footnotes, give us a unique way to view our eyes, do we have generous eyes or stingy eyes?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take a moment today to assess how you invest your eyes. Make a list of things that you spend time consuming with your eyes, and then go back and write next to each one a 1-10, based on 1 being a bad use of what you look at to 10 being a great investment. Be honest, this will serve you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2015&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 15</a></p>
