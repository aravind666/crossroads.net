<p class="noPspace">As we&rsquo;re developing the  programming behind CityLink Center, we&rsquo;re creating very specific  definitions to clearly communicate the complicated issues we&rsquo;re  tackling. Some  of the most important definitions involve the resources our clients already have along with the resources they lack.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We call the matrix that lists resources  and the degree to which a person has them the &ldquo;need spectrum.&rdquo; In placing a client on  the need spectrum, the key resource areas we focus on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment </li>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Spiritual growth</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">At one end of the  spectrum are &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; individuals. These are people with virtually no  resources who lack housing, income, employment and a healthy community  to support them. Often they also have physical and/or mental health  issues.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">At the other end of  the spectrum are &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; individuals, or people who have all of the  resources they need of success: They are employed full time in a job  with benefits; are financially literate and working on money goals; own a  home or are renting a non-subsidized/market rent apartment; are engaged  in healthy community and a local church and have a car or funds to use  public transportation.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">In between these two ends of the  spectrum is the area we call stabilization. A &nbsp;&ldquo;stablilizing&rdquo; person  might be working part-time at a job with no benefits or future growth  opportunities; living in a shelter or with a friend; and has enough  money to eat today but not necessarily tomorrow. They are one lost job,  one eviction and one sickness away from&nbsp; being labeled &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The key thing to  remember about resources is that they complement each other. You need  all of them at the same time to be able to utilize them. For example, if  you have a car but no job and therefore no money to use and maintain  it, you&rsquo;re not thriving. If you have a job but no transportation to get  to it, you&rsquo;re not thriving.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The work of CityLink Center is to move  our clients one by one from &ldquo;stabilizing&rdquo; to &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; status in every  resource area, helping them move from poverty to self-sufficiency.</p>
