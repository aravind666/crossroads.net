<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Jealous Longing</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were learning what James has to teach us about humility.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 4:4-5</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You adulterous people, dont you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">A jealous longing for someone isnt a simple or fleeting emotion. Its a desire for undivided loyalty--which is why James says we must choose between the world and God. And this explanation of Gods longing helps give clarity to the first part of todays passage where James says that being friends with the world is more than having a few imbalanced priorities. Its like were cheating on our relationship with God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, show me any areas in my life where Im being a friend of the world. Help me understand what it means to be in a loyal relationship with you---and the freedom that comes from that.</p>
