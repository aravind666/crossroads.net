<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>God took a crazy risk in giving mankind free will, and Jesus respects that free will. He didnt assume that healing is what this man wanted. The question was "Do you want to get well?" The mans response, although not direct, was his way of sayingmy actions prove that I want to get well, but even my actions fail.We cantmakeourselves well or whole on our own. Sometimes there are action steps, but repeating actions without relationship with the one who made you is just religion.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Picture Jesus asking you, "______ (your name here), do you want to get well?" Whats your response?</p>
