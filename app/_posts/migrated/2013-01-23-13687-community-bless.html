<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Bless</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Today is our final day in Romans 12. Lets look at how to remain united in community by overcoming division.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0012ERB-UfQCuF-bTxpDlai36B-1QcBNo6rqUIO-1AJlH_GyJxC7ywUtCIrFjmDZmMzpoAwo5lNFqT4HGWLh5tduQZhW_-3Za7mmktwn9jgLbqqQZ-55dJok6DitFOOhrQRCgxiR4BJb17gKwGjXgcP3xXKuHKlVJNXAm1eUtk3DRk4wz8h7mV7bs1kYRuXTuoUHP7VdQ4rhVN63vtb0DjCkw==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Romans 12:14-21</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This week, weve offered ourselves up to God and out to our community. We can trust God and his response to us, but people are a little more unpredictable. Paul, the author of this letter to the Romans, includes what to do when it all goes wrong. When people in our community disappoint us or mistreat us, we are called to treat them the same way we want to be treated when we drop the ball....because if you havent already...you will. This list at the end of Romans isnt easy, but if all of us committed to love like this, community would be delicious. Can you imagine how the world would view us as Christ followers if we all committed to show love and mercy in such a bold way?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of one person who says they follow Christ, but drives you a little bit crazy. Write a blessing to them. You dont have to give it to them. God hears your blessing. Hint: most blessings start with the word "may", like "may you have joy" or "may God bless your finances."</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Talk for a little bit about each others gifts. Share what you think yours is, and even better, the gifts you see in others in your group.</li>
<li>Whats one way you struggle to conform to the image of Christ?</li>
<li>What was it like to bless someone you dont like very much?</li>
</ul>
