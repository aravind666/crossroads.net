<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Present</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week we are going to continue to look at two key questions in our faith: What are you hearing from God? And what are you going to do about it? This week we focus on how that works in community.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 18:20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace">REFLECT</p>
<p class="noPspace">You have spent time over the last two weeks listening and discerning Gods voice. If you are looking for God, he guarantees that he is there when we gather. Together with other believers we can hear more frequently and louder. Community can be a large church service on the weekend, but it can also be lunch with a friend or two.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Make a list, right now, of people that help you experience more of God when you spend time with them.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Revelation 3</a></p>
