<p class="noPspace">Just a reminder that if you have Awaited tickets you&rsquo;re not planning to use, we need you to <a title="Return Awaited Tickets" href="http://www.crossroads.net/awaited/returnTickets.php">return them online</a> so others can find tickets to the "sold-out" show. If you haven&rsquo;t been able to find even General Admission tickets, you can still show up to a show and we&rsquo;ll do our best to find a seat for you after ticket-holders are seated, but we can&rsquo;t guarantee space or that groups without tickets will be able to sit together.</p>
