<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Have an Open Door</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the last few weeks, The Daily has taken a deep look at the book of Acts. Today, well finish our study of how its lessons apply to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for the thoughts and words to tell others about him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+28%3A24-31&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Acts 28:24-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This is how the early church grew: Paul traveled from town to town, nation to nation telling others about Jesus. And they told others about Jesus. It wasnt easy. He met a lot of angry people along the way who accused him of breaking the law, threw him in jail and beat him. But he didnt stop. He listened for Jesus and followed him. No matter where he was or who he met, a friend or an enemy, Paul left his door open for everyone to meet Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Keep your door open. This can look different for everyone---inviting someone to church, being a positive role model or straight up telling someone about Jesus. Think about what you can do to have an open door with others. Then go and do it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+28&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 28</a></p>
