<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Good Sons and Daughters: Receive Your Brokenness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We should recognize that we are all broken. Focus on verse 31.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:28-31&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21:28-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus said that corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom before we will. People who do not look the best from the outside are actually best prepared to receive. Their brokenness is externally more obvious. For many of us, our brokenness is dealt with inwardly. Because it isnt obvious, we dont have to admit our brokenness openly, which prevents us from receiving from God or other people. Not judging others brokenness and receiving your own sets you up to see the Kingdom through Gods eyes. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about ways that you dont admit that youre broken and ways that you judge others. Then pray to God, God, I recognize that I am broken. Allow me to see others through your eyes today and love them in their brokenness too. Amen.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 5</a></p>
