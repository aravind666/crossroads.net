Josh, Andrea and Robbie decided to try something new, and it was powerful: people taking communion were also invited to share with those three any words they thought the Spirit was prompting them with.<br><br>Scriptures like Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16 speak of us "speaking to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs." So the idea was to listen to how the Spirit was prompting people and try to craft a song reflecting these cries of God's heart and our own, in the moment.<br><br>Exact quotes that were written down as people came forward are linked at the bottom of this entry, but here are the lyrics to the song that were distilled on the spot:<br> <br><em>I’ve been here all along<br>And I will carry you<br>Wait and let Me lead you<br>Be strong, remember Me<br><br>(response)<br>Let Your light shine through us<br>Let Your love flow through us<br>Forgive us in Your open arms<br>For Your love has no end</em><br> <br>I prayed while they were putting their heads together and trying to come up with a chord progression. After about five minutes they tried to sing it, and it was pretty bad. They didn't come with a pre-packaged tune they wanted to put words to, but instead were dependent on God to match a new tune to new words. This kind of innovation is never easy and never clean.<br><br>I'm actually glad that for once people could see some of the headscratching the goes on behind the scenes. The person who doesn't serve at Crossroads and only consumes a tight, error-free service with elements like cool recap videos of ReachOut events might assume that everything is easy and things just come together. They don't. Nearly everything Crossroads has done in 14 years has been grueling and a test of patience, often filled with disappointment that doesn't get public airplay. Last night people saw what real ministry is like in a small microcosm of time.<br> <br>As the band struggled through the words, all of a sudden it all clicked. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever witnessed: God's people writing a song together in 15 minutes, which moved many to tears (including Andrea). Somewhere along the line, the Divine took human efforts and supercharged them into a holy moment. You would have thought that the song was prewritten, prerehearsed and prerecorded. It was beautiful, in just the way everything that God's involved with is beautiful.<br><br>So let's not be dismayed when things we are going after get stalled and mired in the mud. Let's keep working, keep trying and keep trusting that things will click and God will have His way.<br><br><a href="/"><strong>Listen to the song</strong></a><br><a href="/" title="Song Notes (PDF)"><strong>Read the song notes</strong></a> that came from many of you, and were written down in the moment.</body></html>
