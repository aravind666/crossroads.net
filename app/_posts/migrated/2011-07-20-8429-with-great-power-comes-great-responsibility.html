<p>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please make the Holy Spirit the source of power behind my words.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1106653749459&amp;s=0&amp;e=001ygoFnp9K2at4wViR6qc7ihvM5OoDWwE3u_ekCIKxM1Aw_0xrnSvz9aXLs7o2XUkbruECJ9eOIIjEJYeKD3o4tD9aeD3Ku8yxJD-w6jojvsDiRlZjybQ6D5CFGRarINMnIMgbi3legRE9wYPkKoaP_4od_9AEAit01Al_kZGPtnbKdHmfg_cNxgzEiMgNbxgIL_hD-dO5aJunCwG4xHYosg==" target="_blank">James 3:1-12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The  tongue is like a super hero...or super villain, depending on the day,  the hour, or maybe even the sentence! The tongue wakes in the morning  and asks itself, "Tongue, what will you choose today? To use your powers  for good, or for evil?" Super Tongue has no conviction, no moral  loyalty to anyone. And left to its own devices, Super Tongue will choose  evil every time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>James  isnt saying were expected to be perfect, but it is critical that we  acknowledge this great source of power. Every word we speak can have an  impact to tear down, or to build up. But there is good news: when we  have a connection with God at the source of our words, the tongue can  generate words that speak encouragement, worship, love and life. Imagine  the super-human impact your words can have today, if you speak every  word you think God wants you to speak.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Has  there been a time in your life when someone spoke words to you that  produced bad things in you evil, like fear or discouragement? Write  about this instance. Are you ready to acknowledge that those words were  lies? Now, instead of writing, SPEAK ALOUD the following, filling in the  blanks: "I forgive ____ for telling me ____. I now know that was a lie  and the truth about me is that I am loved and valued by God more than I  can imagine."</p>
<p></p>
