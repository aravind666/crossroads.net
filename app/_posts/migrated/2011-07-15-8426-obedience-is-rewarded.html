<p>Obedience is Rewarded</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, continue to teach me to submit to your will, and grow my hearts desire towards obedience.</em></p>
<p></p>

<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1106574400183&amp;s=0&amp;e=001zHnWDHCHgWw-QPdtREqF74cI5eDQan-NGvoPNMuTX6PptBIod1_qVPiEI8IMXHiHFdR5tRB0fdM0q52MfbCHlsq227OO7reg5sioBEASTRVfI079LKY4XULGxUs24YLTFvZ8so9YPTy97LrFnYPcLxzvayJ8F35v9JZz_HnAwfBxOgjndrbbAEJABiVBX9mY5oJ-BflkE34hQVna1mt2GjViTj8Vc39B" target="_blank">Genesis 22:15-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Our motivation for obedience should always stem from a desire for deeper</p>
<p>relationship with God, but know that obedience also comes with a bonus-a promise of blessing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God  rejoiced over Abraham for his obedience, and he promised to richly  bless him and all of his descendants. And Jesus, one of Abrahams  descendants, would go on to bless all the nations of the earth, by dying  on the cross for our sins. Jesus obedience through laying down his  life was rewarded by providing a way for all people to be reconciled to  God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember,  God just wants relationship with us. He wants us to choose to obey him  out of love, and ultimately our faithful obedience is rewarded.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think  of a time God blessed you for your obedience. Take some time to thank  Him for his kindness, his blessing, and for keeping his promise.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK TWO DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks</em></p>
<p><em>content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your</em></p>
<p><em>roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Has  God ever asked you to do anything difficult or that made you feel  uncomfortable? In what ways did you try to bargain or negotiate with  God? What held you back from obeying? How did you overcome it?</li>
<li>Compare a time when you were obedient to God with a time you rebelled. How was your faith impacted in each situation?</li>
<li>None  of us are perfect. We all have flaws and shortcomings that can keep us  from obeying God. But God sees us as his perfect children and can use  all of us for his good. Take some time to encourage one another and point out a strength or a way that you see God using each person.</li>
</ul>
