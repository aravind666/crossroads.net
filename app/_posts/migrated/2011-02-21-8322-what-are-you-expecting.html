<p>What Are You Expecting?</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Chances are good its happened to you before: You bought a crummy car because the exterior looked good, you got into a bad business deal because it seemed lucrative, you wrote off a friendship because of a snap judgment, and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It rarely changes with age. Regardless of the context, we tend to see exactly what we want to see.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same rings true when it comes to Jesus. The expectations we bring to the table significantly impact the way we understand and relate to Him today. So for the next four weeks, were going to take a fresh look at the life of Jesus--and attempt to broaden or change our expectations of him.</p>
<p></p>
