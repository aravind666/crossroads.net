<p>Faith is Nothing Without Action</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, may you inject me with your boldness and courage to follow through on what you ask of me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202:26&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:26</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Weve spent some time talking about how God desires us to listen to his voice. But</p>
<p>hearing is just the first step. Obedience by its nature requires action. In fact, you can</p>
<p>have all the faith in the world, but if you dont do anything, your faith means nothing. Its dead, according to James.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This doesnt mean that God is only about our deedswe dont have to earn his love. But faith is more than just believing. Faith in God means that we trust him enough to listen to his voice and do what he asks of us. Our actions should be a natural extension of our faith and our desire to be in alignment with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Has there been a time in your life where you thought you might have been prompted by</p>
<p>God to take action, but failed to do so? Write it down. Ask God for forgiveness and do what He asked of you today... right now... ready, set, go... What are you waiting for? Why havent you done it yet? Why are you still reading this?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 2</a></p>
