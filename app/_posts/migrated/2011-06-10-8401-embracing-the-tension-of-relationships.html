<p>Embracing the tension of relationships</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%204:9-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Is there a bigger source of tension in our lives than relationships? Friendships, romance and family relationships all come with their own challenges. But they also provide some of the most powerful, uplifting joys in our lives. Even though we sometimes cant stand our friends and family, we certainly cant live without them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading takes a very pragmatic view of relationships: lifes much easier to handle when you have someone with you to share the load. And its not just spiritual talk: studies have shown that people who keep healthy social lives into older age have better odds of reaching 80, 90 or 100 years old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just as you cant paint a house without spilling paint on your jeans, you cant build healthy, lifelong relationships without occasionally running into conflict. Part of making a relationship great is embracing the inevitability of conflict, and finding healthy ways to deal with and grow from the tension.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think about your best friend. It could be a long-time friend, a significant other or a family member. Write a list of the ways this relationship makes you a better person. Then, write a list of the ways you and your friend tend to butt heads.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Compare your lists side-by-side. How do you balance the benefits and conflicts in this relationship?</p>
