<p class="noPspace"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</span></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">God invests where there is the best hope for return. If we see Him as a good father, we learn what he has to teach (like the first two men in the story) and act. But there is a third man, and he approaches God very differently. He doesnt trust the boss. He is fearful of discipline and only notices the shrewdest elements of Gods character, and not the whole picture. The mere fact that money has been given to this third man shows that God is trusting him, but he doesnt choose to trust God in return. Believing that God is good and trusting him is the beginning of taking powerful risks in our life.</span></p>
