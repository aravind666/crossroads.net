<p><strong>Friday, February 18 </strong><br>Victory Song</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for being a shepherd to me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%2023&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 23</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Many of us have probably heard this song beforebut where? Possibly a funeral. Whether in real life or on TV, Psalm 23 has been indelibly linked with death, sorrow and mourning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet nothing could be further from its intended purpose. This is a song of hopea song of triumph. Mourning and sadness have no place here. We celebrate while our enemies watch, we walk fearlessly through danger, and we journey on the path that God himself has laid for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a song for those who will never experience true death.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Psalm 23 is a song of victoryone intended to remind us that everything will be good in the end. Take some time today and listen to a song (you can find several free for download <a href="/downloads">here</a>) that reminds you of the same thingthat God will win in the end. Remember that this is His message for you, not just some feel-good song.</p>
