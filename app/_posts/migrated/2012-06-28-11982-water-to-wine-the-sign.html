<p class="noPspace"><strong>Water to Wine: The Sign</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">After being baptized and being tempted in the desert, Jesus performs his first miracle at this wedding in Cana. The book of John refers to all Jesus miracles as "signs." Read the story today as a Jewish party guest looking for the sign.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>What might this sign have been saying to the Jewish guests about the good life? In the Jewish faith, clay jars were used for ceremonial washings. The Jewish people followed extensive rules, like washings, to be able to approach a Holy God. However, Jesus came to usher in a new way of living and interacting with God. The wine represents God leading us from the inside, with his Spirit. So Gods people are like these clay jars, no longer led by law and ceremony, but by the freedom of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>You are a jar. Are you filled with water or wine? Remember that watered-down wine is simply not tasty. Ask the Lord to show you places he wants to lead you into freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which person or persons in the story this week did you connect with the most: Mary boldly asking, servants submitting, bridegroom receiving mercy, disciples growing in belief, or the Jewish guests coming to understand the sign?</li>
<li>Who did you struggle to relate to this week in the story and why?</li>
<li>What might you do to believe a little more this week that Jesus is the son of God and that he wants freedom for you?</li>
