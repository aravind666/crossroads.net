<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Surrender has become a negative word. When we hear it we tend to think about the downside to surrender (giving up control, losing out, etc.) But in the verse today, Jesus illustrates the upside of surrender. This servant was 100% surrendered to doing what was best for his master. As a result, he was rewarded with more to manage and the opportunity to share in the masters happiness. This week well look at a few other places in scripture that illustrate the upside of surrender.</p>
