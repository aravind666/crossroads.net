church journey&quot; in now in its second week. (How are those groups going?) This past weekend, Brian Tome spoke with
us about how generosity frees us and he challenged us to think about whether we're living in absence or abundance.<br /><br />In case you missed it, you can <a href=\"../my/media/playMedia.php&amp;idMedia=551\">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href=\"../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=552\">watch it</a><a href=\"../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=552\">.</a> <a href=\"http&#58;//www.salon.com/ent/video_dog/comedy/2006/02/06/debt/index.html\"></a><br /><br />If you didn't get one last weekend, you can also <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/Journey%20Materials/Consumed/Consumed_Guide.pdf\">download the Consumed Guide</a> (as a PDF), and find a <a href=\"../consumed/groups_small_group_search.php\">Consumed group</a>. (<em>Note&#58; Study Notes will be suspended for the Consumed Journey because we're all working through the Consumed Guides.</em>)
