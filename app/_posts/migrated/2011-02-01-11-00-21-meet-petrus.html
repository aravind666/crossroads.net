<p class="noPspace">Meet Petrus.</p>
<p class="noPspace">I first met Petrus back in 2009 on a Mamelodi Hospice home visit.</p>
<p class="noPspace">HIV+ and wheelchair bound, his house was a prison as his brother had packed it so full of broken electronics there was no room for Petrus to move.  Because of his brother’s abuse, Petrus was unable to get the social grant that would enable him to care for his young son, pay for his medication &amp; ultimately improve his life. Petrus was frankly waiting to die.</p>
<p class="noPspace">The Hospice workers stepped in, involving social workers &amp; police to improve the situation. Yesterday I was pleasantly surprised to visit him again and see how much his life has improved. Because of the Bophelong Hospice work, Petrus now has full ownership over his home. It is clean &amp; clear--enabling him to move around, take care of himself AND his 15yr old son. The hospice nurses care for him regularly—and you can tell. He looks healthier, happier &amp; stronger. It was a gift to see him again. In 2009, I sang him a song in his prison of a home, believing it would be the last time I’d see him alive. Thankfully, I was wrong.  While we’re here, we would like to bless Petrus by building a wheelchair ramp to his front door.  And that is Petrus. </p>
