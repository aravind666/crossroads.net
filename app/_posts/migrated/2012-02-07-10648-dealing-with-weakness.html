<p class="noPspace"><strong>Dealing with Weakness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20timothy%206:11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Timothy 6:11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When were overcome by our weaknesses, we often make choices that are opposed to the life God intends for us (what the Bible calls sin). But God doesnt want our lives just to be about sin management. Youve probably heard it said that the best defense is a good offense; the answer is not in avoiding the bad things, its in pursuing the right things that bring life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Its critical for us to pursue daily time when God has our undivided attention, when our spouse has the same (if were married), when we can be in honest community with others, and when we can enjoy healthy fun and pleasure. Take at least 10 minutes today to set aside some of these blocks of time on your calendar, then commit to following through with them.</p>
