<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is a Worker with Vision</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our culture has a lot to say about manhood, but God says something different about it. Over the next few weeks, The Daily will take a look at what the Bible says about manhood.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As you pray, ask God to give you vision to set and achieve realistic goals.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A15&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:15</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There are obvious differences between boys and men, and there are some we dont think or talk about. One of them is that a boy only cares about instant gratification. A man sets a vision and works at it. Sometimes this vision comes from God, like he did with Adam. He gave Adam a garden to tend and watch over, giving him purpose and a vision to work at. Like Adam, men who have a vision take the steps and do the work to see the vision become a reality.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about vision. What is your vision today or what could it be? It could be about your job, your family or a hobby. Think about what it looks like to work at that vision.</p>
