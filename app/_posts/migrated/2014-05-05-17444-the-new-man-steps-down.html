<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Steps Down</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man makes tough choices and takes a minority position. This week, The Daily will focus on what God says to men about living and working in the minority.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to give you the strength to take a low place.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A12-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 4:12-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Taking a minority position can also mean taking a low place and showing humility. We might be surrounded by people who always challenge authority---a boss at work, a father figure, or even someone whos our peer. Maybe were even one of those people. In many ways, culture celebrates challenging authority. It tells men to kick butt and take names. But the new man recognizes when they need to step down from the soapbox and show humility.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pick a situation---at work, with friends or at home---where you normally want to have the best idea or be Mr. Cool and recognize how you can stand in the minority by being humble. Pay attention to how it feels to do that and what happens because of it.</p>
