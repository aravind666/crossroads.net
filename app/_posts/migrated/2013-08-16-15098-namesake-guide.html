<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Namesake: Guide</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We finish out our week looking at Gods desire to promote himself.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2031:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 31:3-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lets pause today and look at the word namesake a little differently. Your last name says whose name you are carrying on--your parents and their parents, etc. When God promotes himself for his namesake--he is not only bringing attention to himself, but he is blessing all that are his namesake--his people.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Give yourself a new last name today, just in your journal. It might be something like Bob Gods-namesake or Lisa Jesus-bride or Sam Gods-loved-one. Let God give you an identity in his name.</p>
