<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Spiritual Parents: Admonish</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In a culture focused on the self-made man or woman, we will unearth the original benefits that God intended through spiritual fathers and mothers.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 4:14</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we show defensiveness when corrected, we are functioning in shame. But God wants us to receive admonishment, good advice and warning. This prevents every generation from repeating the same mistakes. Really, its not all about you. We as a family of believers are meant to continue to mature, and we can do that when we pass on wisdom. Learning to receive the leadership of those older than us in faith is the beginning of maturing into a spiritual parent ourselves.</p>
