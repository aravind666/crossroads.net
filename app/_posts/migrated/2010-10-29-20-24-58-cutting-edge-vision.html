<p class="noPspace">CityLink Center&rsquo;s goal is to move our clients one by one from &ldquo;stabilizing&rdquo; to &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; status, helping them move from poverty to self-sufficiency.&nbsp; (Read more about the process <a title="Stabilization is Key To Thriving" href="/blog/view/4/69">here</a>.)&nbsp; As we pursue this cutting edge vision, we are encouraged by the results of other organizations that have tested out this model.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The <a href="http://www.aecf.org/">Annie E. Casey Foundation</a>, which is focused on meeting the needs of today&rsquo;s vulnerable children and families, recognized how challenging it was for low-income families to navigate an incredibly fragmented system to obtain critical services.&nbsp; Several years ago, they created a new framework called <a href="http://www.aecf.org/MajorInitiatives/FamilyEconomicSuccess/CentersforWorkingFamilies.aspx">Centers for Working Families</a> (CWF) to help low-income families reach financial stability and move up the economic ladder. The CWF approach bundles access to a full range of services, including employment, financial and other support services, in a convenient location to help families build self-sufficiency, stabilize their finances, and move ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Piloted in several sites across the country, the CWF model has produced promising results: clients receiving bundled services were 3-4 times more likely to stay employed, get vocational certificates or degrees that would allow them to move towards thriving economically than clients who were receiving individual services.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Today, there are more than 60 organizations engaged in this way of providing services including major foundations that have traditionally funded organizations providing individual services.&nbsp; These funders are able to leverage their giving for more effective services for low-income working families.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">So, while the concept of CityLink Center is not new, it is on the cutting edge.&nbsp;</p>
