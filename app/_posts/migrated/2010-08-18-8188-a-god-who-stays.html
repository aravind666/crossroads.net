<p>A God Who Stays</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness in your life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%2012:1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 12:1-3</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So God created a perfect world, and mankind promptly messed it up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By all accounts, God should have just walked away and scrapped everything. There was nothing to obligate Him to do anything else. He owed mankind nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet He didnt leave. He stayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And God did more than just stay. Beginning with Abraham (originally called Abram), God set a plan in motion to redeem mankind. Through Abrahams lineage came Jesus, whose death and resurrection cancel out our sin, if we believe in him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the faithfulness of Godthat he stays when he has every right to leave, and that he continually makes promises to care, protect and redeem.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about this idea that God stayed when he wasnt obligated to do so? How does that apply to you?</li>
<li>Why would God behave this way? What motivates Him?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>God stays with you. Make a list of places where you need for Him to be in your life right now, and then spend a minute inviting him into those places.</p>
