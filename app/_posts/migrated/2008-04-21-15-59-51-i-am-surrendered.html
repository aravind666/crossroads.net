to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we
learned that Jesus cannot be "added on top" of all of our other stuff, but that following him means dying to ourselves so that we can find life.<br><br>In case you missed the service, you can <a href="/my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=582">watch</a> (including the John Adams video) or <a href="/my/media/playMedia.php&amp;idMedia=583">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/SN-4-19-20-08.pdf">Study Notes</a> (PDF) and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/0419_20Program.pdf">Program</a> (PDF).</body></html>
