          <img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/iam90x90_1.jpg\" alt=\"I AM\" hspace=\"10\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" align=\"right\" />We're in week three of   &quot;<a href=\"../my/media/messages.php\">I AM...</a>&quot; In this series, we're examining the life of Jesus and seeing what it looks like
to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we
learned that Jesus cannot be &quot;added on top&quot; of all of our other stuff, but that following him means dying to ourselves so that we can find life.<br /><br />In case you missed the service, you can <a href=\"../my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=582\">watch</a> (including the John Adams video) or <a href=\"../../my/media/playMedia.php&amp;idMedia=583\">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/SN-4-19-20-08.pdf\">Study Notes</a> (PDF) and <a href=\"../images/uploadedImages/0419_20Program.pdf\">Program</a> (PDF).
