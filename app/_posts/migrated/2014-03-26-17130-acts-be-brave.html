<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Remember when Peter and John healed the man at the temple? It caused quite the hullabaloo. Leaders of Jerusalem arrested them and asked them for an explanation. Yet even in the face of public scrutiny, Peter and John, with help from the Holy Spirit, were brave and boldly told the truth. </p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants you to be brave. Maybe youre seeking courage in a situation at work or in a relationship. Whatever it is, take a step toward acting boldly. Dont worry---God is with you every step of the way.</p>
