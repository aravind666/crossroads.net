<html><body><p>Whether spring cleaning leads you to realize you need something or you need to get rid of something, the place to do it is the <a href="../corkboard" title="Corkboard link">Corkboard</a>. In one weekend, I gave away a set of patio furniture I didn't need to a new homeowner who did, and I got an outdoor toddler swing and ride-on toy for my son in great condition. Along the way, I met two great people in our community I didn't know. On the <a href="../corkboard" title="Corkboard link">Corkboard, </a>you can post something you need or something you want to give away. So, you can save a little green, or be more green by keeping something out of the landfill. </p></body></html>
