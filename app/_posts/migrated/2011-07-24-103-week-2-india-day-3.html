<p class="noPspace">Day 3 was our first day to really jump in  and we landed on both feet!</p>
<p class="noPspace">Our mighty team of six was up and praying together at 6:45am for a powerful time at the Ladies Conference today.</p>
<p class="noPspace">We drove an hour and 15 minutes outside of Mumbai through the hills and past some cows blocking traffic to worship with Vasai Baptist Church. We were so excited that we were 15 minutes early after Week 1s challenge getting to church in heavy traffic last week. Pastor Christopher warmly welcomed us. Even though were from the other side of the world, we felt at home singing familiar hymns and choruses and worshipping together.</p>
<p class="noPspace">After the service, we went to the Golden Chariot to begin the Ladies Conference at 11am. We were able to share in Indian culture by having chai tea and biscuits with the 25 ladies from several local Indian churches. Our host was Ramona Dsouza, the co-founder of the Crossover Foundation which is the Indian NGO partnering with Crossroads and IJM. After her welcome, Crossovers aftercare director and IJMs church relations director introduced to the ladies the overwhelming realities of sex-trafficking in Mumbai and stirred their hearts for justice.</p>
<p class="noPspace">After lunch, Katherine led our team in an ice breaker to demonstrate how were all connected with one another; there was a lot of laughter and smiles as we got to know our new friends. Usha, Alissa, Kelly and Camille shared their stories of how God brought us to India and what Hes calling us to do. Pastor Vivian Fernandes, the head of the Maharashtra Baptist Society, proclaimed that God will answer our prayers to build more aftercare homes. What we see from Vivian and others is that their first response to a need is prayer. Thats a contrast to our culture where we often start with action. We loved his expression, When we work, we work; when we pray, God works. Finally, Ramona challenged the ladies by saying, I pray that you cant sleep tonight until you wrestle with how God is calling you to respond to our girls.</p>
<p class="noPspace">After we drove back to the hotel, most of us crashed uncontrollably for a couple of hours. Then, we broke naan (their yummy bread) with Ramona and her husband Keith, and shared from our hearts how weve been impacted so far. We really felt like family. Keith and Ramona were still talking about how our Week 1 team blessed them at the Kids Camp and Pastors Conference.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Were excited for tomorrows Youth Conference where Katherine, Kelly and Roberta will have the opportunity to speak!</p>
