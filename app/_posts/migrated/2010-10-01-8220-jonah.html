<p>Jonah</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Prayer: God, thank you for making a way for me to come to you when I was lost and without you. Dont let me become complacent in my faith.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Jonah%204:5-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Jonah 4:5-11</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Chances are youve heard the story of Jonah, the man who was told by God to go to the city of Nineveh to convince the lost Assyrian people to turn to God. Jonah disobeys and takes a ship going the other direction from his Assyrian enemies. When a storm arises, the other shipmates throw Jonah overboardand he would have died at sea without Gods provision of the big fish. So hes in the fishs belly for three days and is spit up on land. Then he finally goes to Nineveh where the people repent and turn to God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Immediately afterward, Jonah has a supernatural experience with a vine. We see how Jonah cares more about God creating comfort for him, and less about all of Gods creation or the people in Nineveh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How often do we do the same? How often do we argue with God about what he gives us or takes away, when there is a whole world out there of his creationand hes waiting for us to be Gods hands and feet?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Talk to God and ask him to reveal the things that distract you from his larger plan for you and for the world.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gods chosen people, the Israelites, were told through the generations that Gods purpose for them was to bless them so that they could bless all people. Instead, theyre constantly distracted by money, other gods and selfish ambitions. Reading these Minor Prophets can still resonate with us today. Through Jesus we are Gods people, and we still have the ability to be distracted from Gods larger calling and purpose. With a little more detailed reading, we see glimpses of the foretelling of Jesus and the Holy Spirit as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do the people of the Old Testament who were distracted remind you of modern day Christ-followers, and more importantly, yourself?</li>
<li>Do you see any ways that the New Testament drops any hints (the way the Old Testament does) about what God plans to do next?</li>
<li>In the New Testament, prophesy is described in I Corinthians 14:3: But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. Talk with each other about how you can use the gift of prophesy according to that definition.</li>
</ul>
