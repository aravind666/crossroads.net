<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Rahab: Unlikely</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Rahab is an important Old Testament story that echoes other stories. Its actually echoed itself in the New Testament in Christs lineage in Matthew, and as an important moment of faith in Hebrews 11. Lets put our focus on that story this week.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%202:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Joshua 2:1-7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So, if you were going to start a Bible story, would you expect that it would begin with two Godly men going to stay with a prostitute? Its definitely an industry designed to understand the hidden, and indeed, the story begins with Rahab finding just the right spot to hide them.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">How often do we eliminate certain people as outside of Gods reach or think that there are certain parts of our stories that God just cant use? Whichever strikes you as true, journal about that today. Focus on why you think its true and move it to the forefront so God can begin to access it. Lay it all out for God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 23</a></p>
