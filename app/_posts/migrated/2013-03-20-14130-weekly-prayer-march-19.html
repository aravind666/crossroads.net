<p class="noPspace"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this weeks thoughts.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em></em>On Thursday of this past week, I had the privilege of signing closing documents on behalf of Crossroads that transfers ownership of property in Mason to Crossroads. Let me say that again. WE NOW OWN PROPERTY IN MASON. We are now reviewing final designs for the renovation of the property and are in negotiations with general contractors for the project. We are well on our way to a permanent home in Mason.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"> This has been a long process. I remember meeting with 4 people in Brian Tomes office about seven years ago (one of which was Mason campus pastor Mark Stecher before he was on staff). They had heard Brian paint the vision for multisite and wanted Mason to be the first location. They all had friends and neighbors that they wanted to come to Crossroads but Oakley was just too far away for them. I remember the painful 2-year process of locating a site that would work for us that eventually landed us in the Mason Middle School. I remember telling the core team that perhaps God wanted us to focus on building the church before we had a church building. We now have a thriving and active church community in Mason and I cant wait for them to have a home of their own. People are coming into relationship with Jesus that likely wouldnt have had it not been for the Mason location.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>Read this story:</strong> <em>My 14 year old daughter invited our twin, 6yr. old neighbors to come to church in Oakley on Saturday night the week before Easter. On the way home I asked them what they had learned. They immediately started throwing out things they remembered from the lesson.</em><em style="line-height: 1;">Peter tore off a guys ear but Jesus told him to put down his sword!Jesus washed his friends feet because they walked around in sandals and got camel poop all over their feet and they were really dirty! And, Jesus died on a cross they made from a tree! Yeah, but Jesus came back to life to make us free!And, he didnt have to die! He could have walked away!<span style="line-height: 1;">After this huge response to my question I told them that I was really impressed with all that they had learned. One of the twins piped up and responded, I dont care if youre impressed, Im just happy about Jesus!</span></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>After that evening, I called the girls mom to tell her how much they had learned and how much they enjoyed KC. I invited her to bring them back for Easter the next weekend not expecting them to come. She brought her 3 kids, her boyfriend and his 3 kids. Her boyfriend said, If we had a Crossroads in Mason, Id come every week! I was happy to tell him that we were planning to open a site the coming fall. They started coming and serving regularly as soon as we opened. The girls have grownup in Kids Club at Crossroads Mason.Now 8<sup>th</sup>graders, they were baptized this last November.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please pray and thank God for providing us with the property in Mason. Ask God to give us wisdom as choices are made with regard to design and construction. Pray for provision and that God will bless us with strong fulfillment of Game Change commitments to pay for this site.</span></p>
