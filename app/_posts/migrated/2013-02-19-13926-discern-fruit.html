<p class="noPspace"><strong>Discern: Fruit</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue studying ways to discern the voice of the Holy Spirit when we listen.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:22-25&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:22-25</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When we get a little nudge in our heads, or begin to notice a pattern in the Bible and teachings we are hearing, we might ask ourselves, is that God? This verse in Galatians is the perfect first filter to run your discernment through. If you act on what you are hearing, will it plant a seed to bear this kind of fruit? If it causes division or brings glory to you and not God, that might be a worldly thought instead of a Spirit thought.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of a time when you experienced the fruit mentioned in todays passage. If you are drawing a blank, imagine what it might look or feel like.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Jude 1</a></p>
