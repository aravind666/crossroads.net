<p>The Invitation to Move</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes in prayer: "God, today I want to respond to your invitation to move in faith."</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>These last three weeks weve looked at story after story of people who moved in faith and radically experienced God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In  all these stories there was an explicit or implicit invitation to move  in faith. This same invitation gets extended to us every day. So throw  off the things that keep you from moving in faith--whether thats guilt,  fear, the need to control, the worry about what others will say. With  boldness, respond to Gods invitation to move in faith.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What  is something that keeps you from responding to Gods invitation to move  in faith? Ask God right now to set you free from this weight so you can  run in his direction.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Week Three Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe  a time when you felt like you moved as a response to God. If nothing  comes to mind, discuss an area of your life where youre hoping to hear  Gods direction. </li>
<li>Do you know anyone who is a "mover" in his or her faith? What does that person risk?</li>
<li>What  are ways you could put yourself in the position to hear Gods direction  on your life? Consider the practical things--like times of day, places  where its quiet, people who could hold you accountable.</li>
</ul>
