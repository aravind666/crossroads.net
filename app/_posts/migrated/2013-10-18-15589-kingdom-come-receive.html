<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The kingdom of the world tells us to be preoccupied with getting. This distracts us from what God might be saying about him and about ourselves, keeping us from receiving Him. We can worry about our next job promotion, relationship or meal. Or we can focus on what God takes great pleasure in giving us: the Kingdom itself.</p>
