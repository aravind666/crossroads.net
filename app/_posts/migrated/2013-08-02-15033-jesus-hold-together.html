<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Jesus: Hold Together</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we focus on verse 17 as we continue to look at Jesus identity.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 1:15-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In Jesus, God has made himself fully known. Jesus came first before anything, and it says here that he is literally the one who holds all things together. Take a moment think about that in a large scale way. All of this universe is held together through Jesus--like planets in their orbits. Now, do you believe that is true in your life?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus literally holds you in your form, and there is nothing you have done or thought of that he hasnt done before you. Take a moment to meditate on the verse: He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 2</a></p>
