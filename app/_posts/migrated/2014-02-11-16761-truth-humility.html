<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Truth: Humility</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily assumes that the Bible is only a big book about God and hes the main character. Well look at verses and mull over what it means for us if what they say is true.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to prepare you for whatever he wants to teach you today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+149%3A4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">PSALM 149:4</a></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with salvation.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>ASK YOURSELF</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What does it mean to you that God rewards humility? What does it look like to be humble in your actions at work, school or at home?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God takes pleasure in you. Dont look for ways to get approval or status today---that means stay away from the Facebook posts or being the only guy to talk at the meeting---lay low and put your pleasure in your Dad.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 12</a></p>
