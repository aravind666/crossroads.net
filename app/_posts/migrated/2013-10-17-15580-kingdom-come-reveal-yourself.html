<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Kingdom of God is built on love. Thats why Jesus said it starts within us. When we accept Gods love and share it with others, amazing things happen. His Kingdom is revealed.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a minute (or 4) and listen to the lyrics of this song, <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroadsaudiomessages/Reveal-Yourself.mp3">Reveal Yourself</a>. Ask God to reveal something to you. Maybe its His love, a glimpse of the Kingdom or just a simple love for music. Whatever God wants to tell you, just listen for it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
