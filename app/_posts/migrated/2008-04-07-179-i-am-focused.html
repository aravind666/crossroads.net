<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/images/iam90x90.jpg" alt="I Am" hspace="5" width="90" height="90" align="right">This past weekend was the first week in our new "<a href="/media/series">I AM...</a>" series. We're examining the life of Jesus and seeing what it looks like to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we saw that when Jesus heard from God, he <em>bent his life</em> to that truth. We also learned about how temptations and intentions are not what's important, but action. <br><br>In case you missed the service, you can <a href="/messages/2008-04-06-focused.html">watch</a> or <a href="/messages/2008-04-06-focused.html">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href="/messages/2008-04-06-focused.html">Study Notes</a> (PDF) and <a href="/messages/2008-04-06-focused.html">Program</a> (PDF).<br><br>This coming weekend, Chuck Mingo will be talking about how Jesus engaged other people in his life.</body></html>
