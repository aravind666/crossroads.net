<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Big Vision Culture: Better Country</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Last look today at big vision faith heroes in Hebrews 11. Sarahs husband is the Abraham that we visited yesterday. #Sarahandabe4ever</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2011:11-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:11-12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Sarah was promised a child but then it didnt come until she was way, way, way...way past childbearing years. The miracle of what is said about Sarah in this passage is that she considered God faithful even when he didnt do what he said he would do for a really long time. He said she would have a child and then decades passed before it happened. Having faith here seems to have something to do with believing that God is faithful even when the circumstances dont line up.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Journal today about how God has been faithful to you, and how you trust that he will continue to be.</p>
