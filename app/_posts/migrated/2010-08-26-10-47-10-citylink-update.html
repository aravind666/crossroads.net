<p class="normal noPspace">Welcome to the CityLink blog. During the campaign and beyond, this feed will be your main source for information about what&rsquo;s happening with CityLink, including updates on the vision for combating the cycle of generational poverty to stories of how CityLink partners are already changing lives in Cincinnati for the better, and even ways that you can get involved.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">CityLink leaders, including ReachOut Director Tim Senff, will provide updates on the latest happenings. Many of the posts will be conversation starters&mdash;a place for you to respond with your own stories of how God is moving in your life. We encourage you to be part of the conversation about making the CityLink dream a reality.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
