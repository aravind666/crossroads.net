<p>Success is Different in the Kingdom</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me understand how you define success.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206:%2022-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Joshua 6: 22-25</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If you havent noticed by now, God defines success very differently than the world. For Him, success isnt about money, fame, or prestige. In fact, many people the Bible marks as heroes were those in whom society saw no value. King David was considered the least among his brothers. Rahab was a prostitute. Even Jesus came from a town that had a saying, nothing good comes from Nazareth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Success in Gods eyes is about relationship. Its about listening to Him above all else, and being willing to risk life, wealth, friends, and even family, to pursue Him. The world is pleased when you work a 60-hour-work week. God is pleased when you put down your iPhone to talk with your kid.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write down five things that define success in your life. Then write another list of how you think God might define success in your life. Are they the same? Different? Opposite? Why?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 3</a></p>

<p><strong>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content.</em></p>
<p><em>These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, weve considered how work is supposed to look, and that its a good thing. We know that work shows us parts of Gods character, but those themes often run counter to the American conversation. Maybe youve found that you value a different type of success than God. Maybe youve never stopped to think that God wants you to work. (And maybe thats even a bit scary!). These questions will help you process these ideas a bit more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing up, what were you taught about success? Do those views still affect you today?</li>
<li>What do you think about work now?Has it changed as youve thought about it this week?</li>
<li>Is there anything that scares you about hard work?Is there anything that excites you?</li>
</ul>
