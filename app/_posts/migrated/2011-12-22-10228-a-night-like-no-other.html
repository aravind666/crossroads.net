<p class="noPspace"><strong>A Night Like No Other</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>LISTEN</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="/downloads/playMedia.php?idMedia=1604">O Holy Night</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2011:1-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 11:1-9</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Holy. It means to be set apart, other, or sacred. So this holy night is utterly distinct: a night that is in a category all by itself.</p>

<p class="noPspace">God did something on this night he had never done: He walked on earth as a man. God contained himself within a human body so he could move amongst the children he loved. That moment cannot be anything other than holy.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The wolf living with the lamb. A child putting her hand in a vipers mouth. Isaiah 11:1-9 gives us the full picture of what a restored creation will look like. We are still waiting for the full restoration, but Jesus restores every day. Spend time asking Him to restore something in your life thats broken.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 1</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you went to the Awaited show this week, talk about something that stood out to you or offered a new perspective. If you didnt get a chance to go, share something you connect with in the Christmas story weve been studying, whether thats a character, a theme or a moment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Spend some time telling each other about where you need to experience some restoration (renewal). Pray together for those things.</li>
</ul>
