<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">It doesnt matter if we have a million dollars in the bank or a single dollar in our pocket, we are among the worlds richest people. That means all of us. How did we get this wealth? God gave it to us because he loves us, plain and simple. And when we lean into God and trust that he provides for our every need---friends, body, mind and finances---we are rich.</p>
