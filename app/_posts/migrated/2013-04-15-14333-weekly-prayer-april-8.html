<p class="normal noPspace"><em>Each week, Executive Pastor Darin Yates gives us a Game Change-related topic for meditation and prayer. Here are this weeks thoughts.</em></p>

<p class="normal noPspace">I have a confession to make. In high school, I was a "mathlete." My kids found out about this and poke fun at me. I attempt to make it sound much cooler by emphasizing that I was no ordinary mathlete. I was a CHAMPION mathlete! Sounds better, right?<span style="line-height: 1;">What this means is I love numbers. They simply make sense to me. Im comfortable having a conversation about numbers. That is why Im very comfortable with the message from Brian this weekend. I see the potential and it is staggering.</span></p>

<p class="normal noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Let me elaborate. I believe that the largest stumbling block to spiritual growth in the Crossroads community is financial. I believe it is the most significant "false god" that Americans (and the human race in general) wrestles with. As an example, in the video with Dan Pallotta that was shared this weekend, he quotes a statistic that 2% of US Gross Domestic Product goes to charity. I estimated the amount of ministry giving that Crossroads attenders share... roughly 2%. That is heart breaking to me. We have so much more potential.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">If our community would just increase that by one percentage point to 3%, it would mean an extra $6-8 million per year. That would pay for the new building in Mason in 3 years.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">If our community would just increase their giving to 5% (half a tithe), with another $18-24 million per year, we could likely fund our expansion with never having the need to do another financial campaign.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">If our community took God at his challenge and tithed, this city would fundamentally change. Poverty would be addressed. The hungry would be fed. Education would be best in the world. The arts would be world class. Who knows? The Bengals may even win a championship. Jesus said it himself. If people are faithful, He will multiply our ministry 30, 60, 100 times. One hundred times our weekly attendance (the people we touch on a regular basis) is larger than they population of Cincinnati. Jesus can and will change the city of Cincinnati through our faithfulness.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace"><strong>Pray for our community to embrace generosity, particularly as a percentage of their income, this week.</strong> Let God guide them and strengthen them to trust God in their choices about their finances.</p>
