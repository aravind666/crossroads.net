<p class="noPspace"><strong>Place at the Table: Courtney</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Courtney is 31, works for a local non-profit, and lives with a group of really cool women. She also likes to sing and encourage, and once walked in on the wrong persons funeral, woops. (If you missed this weekends message,<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001-x6k2xVJ3w2Nvpmadvv0dHsXWQWCEsO-MVxxNIJVuUUq-Q7kxRmnmeJEvj7zhs5pSnfaLJvxiHVnfvM3NZWLRlclOu-Zq7J2YrwMdZBAHwa4Llp8sZOjKBdTR_CLcQRb" shape="rect" target="_blank">click here</a>for a video summary.)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET COURTNEY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"For years I remember having this strong thirst and deep curiosity for God. I had friends who grew up in church and knew so much about the Bible and church, that I equated knowledge with a relationship with God. They laughed at me because I didnt know the difference between pew and pulpit, and I thought I had to settle with Jesus being someone I prayed to when I was about to eat or when I was in a difficult time.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Years later, I found out that I didnt have to know anything to understand His love for me. He didnt care if I confused pew and pulpit. That was knowledge of a building, not of a person. I was accepted and wanted, despite the limited amount of info that I had of Him. The fact that I wanted more knowledge of Him warmed his heart. And so, when I realized that there was a place at the table for me (that I actually belonged there and that He wanted me there) that changed everything!</p>

<p class="noPspace">It felt like a movie where the nice, well-off family invites a homeless person to Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, and most of the family is looking at the person, thinking inside that this person does not belong. Then the homeless person wants to leave because they feel even more like an outsider. The one who invited them tells them to have a seat, fixes them a plate and truly welcomes them. I felt like God did that for me, making me feel like I didnt have to get cleaned up to sit at the table, I was worthy to join him just as I was."</p>
