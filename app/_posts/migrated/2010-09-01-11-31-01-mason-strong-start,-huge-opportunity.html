<p class="normal noPspace">I can&rsquo;t wait to officially begin Year Three at Crossroads Mason! We have so much planned for the year ahead, and there are hundreds in our community who uniquely need to hear the message of Jesus in a new &ldquo;voice&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">The journey began five years ago when a handful of us met with leadership and committed to bringing the unique Crossroads style up North as the first &ldquo;campus&rdquo;. We prayed, started planning, and began talking to potential leaders. Not surprisingly, God was already moving in our area, and people were surfacing to help.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Over the first few years, we met as a core team, prayed, looked for a site pastor, and hunted for a facility. Looking back, God&rsquo;s handprint was all over it, using the time we looked for a building to establish vibrant relationships and a team atmosphere. My wife Laurie and I were honored to be a part of it then, just as we are now&mdash;sitting with 1,200 people every Sunday.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">My work background includes 17 years in business and then ministry over the last 12. I lead an organization called OneCity (for the past six years), which connects local churches to work together on some of the biggest issues facing our city like poverty, education, and unemployment (that Crossroads and other area churches helped us launch). The catalytic and activistic culture of Crossroads and OneCity dovetailed together beautifully. Today nearly 190 churches, dozens of local social service agencies and thousands of volunteers are engaged in at least one of 14 city-wide (mostly mentoring) initiatives, building &ldquo;One new City, two lives at a time&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">What Crossroads Mason offers is a great Crossroads experience and the opportunity to do life together with our neighbors up here. We&rsquo;ve hosted two high-quality services every Sunday for nearly two years and have seen an outstanding volunteer response&hellip;but, my heart aches to better attract and invite locals looking for hope and some answers. We need to extend interest to the people we run into at Kroger, see at soccer games and work with; we need to ask them about their God story, and invite them to check out a place that breathes hope and life. Join me in looking for these kinds of encounters so more and more people encounter Jesus!</p>
