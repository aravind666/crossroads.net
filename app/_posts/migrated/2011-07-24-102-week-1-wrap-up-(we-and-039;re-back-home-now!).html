<p class="noPspace">Hey folks!</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">I just wanted to post once more to wrap up Week 1s trip to India. We made it back to Cincy last night about 5pm (after an 8 hour layover in Newark......ugh). Everyone is home now, most likely resting and starting to process the last 9 days of their lives.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">I can tell you from my own story, that India changes people. Whether we want it to or not.......its impossible not to be changed when you come back. When you are there, God stretches you, He refines you, He challenges you, and ultimately He grows you. Weve seen images that will stay with us forever. The maimed children begging on the street corner, the family of 4 traveling from one place to another (all on the same motorcycle...at the same time), the bustling streets filled with more cars, rickshaws, trucks, cows, dogs and people than you would think humanly possible. The christian pastors who are on fire for Jesus, the hotel doorman treating us as if we were royalty, the balwadis that care for 50-60 disadvantaged kids in a 10x20 room, the pizza party we had with 25 girls who have been rescued from a life of brutal and consistent rape. There are amazingly positive images, and some negative images (just like in our country), but they are all images that have changed us.</p>

<p class="noPspace">I will tell you this.....every single trip participant was AWESOME! Ive never seen a group of people step up and be so selfless in some challenging situations in my life. From the Kids Camp that we had to set up for in about 4 mins (with 60 kids waiting, and monsoon rain pouring in to the open air hall we were in), to the Pastor Conference where lifelong relationships were launched, to the day in the aftercare homes. Everyone stepped up, everyone poured out every ounce of love on those we came in contact with, and hopefully everyone will continue to funnel Gods love in to those we are called to serve in India (and at home here in Cincinnati).</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you look at Matthew 25, I feel like folks on this trip were the servants who took their 5 bags of gold, and turned it in to 5 more. They took a risk going to a foreign country, on a tough trip, where they were undoubtedly stretched. But they took their gifts to bless and build in to others in India (mainly our new pastor friends) and saw the fruit from that. Its a great beginning to the vision of building relationship with pastors over there as we continue to move towards transitional homes and aftercare homes to save these girls. And for that, God is saying, "Well done good and faithful servants".......well done.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Thanks for following along.......until next time.</p>
