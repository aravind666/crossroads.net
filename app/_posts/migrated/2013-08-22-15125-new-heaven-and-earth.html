<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Heaven and Earth</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Dang, weve been obsessed with the word new this week. Its a good thing, since God seems to be, too.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2065:17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 65:17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You are a part of Gods epic story that began with the creation of the world and ends (or starts new) with a new heaven and a new earth. Jesus was the beginning of the new way of doing things--a new testament you might say. But a day will come when all will be as God intended--all will be made new.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We cant even imagine what that time will be like, but lets try. Journal today about what you think a new heaven and new earth might look like.</p>
