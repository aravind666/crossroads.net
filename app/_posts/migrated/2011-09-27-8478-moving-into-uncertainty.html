<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its  one thing to move forward when success is guaranteed. Its another when  the outcome is uncertain and bleak. Yet these three friends chose to  move in faith without certainty of the outcome.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right  now there are many people who are facing a "furnace". Some are  unemployed, and uncertain about their future financial prospects. Others  are unsure if theyll beat a serious illness, or be able to keep their  family together. These people know that there are no easy answers right  now. But even in uncertainty, you can move forward with the faith that  empowered Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego as they faced the furnace:</p>
<p></p>
<p>"If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it..."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are you facing a situation that is filled with uncertainty? Ask God to show you how to move forward without all the answers.</p>
<p></p>
