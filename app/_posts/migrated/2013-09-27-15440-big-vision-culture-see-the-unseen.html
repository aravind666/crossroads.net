<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Big Vision Culture: See the Unseen</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Did you know that the Bible has a hall of fame? Hebrews 11 is filled with faith heroes who seem to focus their eyes a little farther out. #whatthefaith</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:1-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 11:1-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Its easiest to notice what is right under our nose, and before we know it, we have a life that is marked by oil changes, grocery store runs and screen time. There are tasks in your life that will always demand your attention. Abel was no different--he had to farm or he couldnt eat. But Abel had his eye on God in all he did and offered the first of his crops as a thankful offering back to God. Giving an offering to a God that you cant see, instead of just eating it or feeding your family, that takes vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">LIft your head today. You can do all the same tasks that you planned to do, but do it as if all of it was an offering back to God. How different might that look?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 9</a></p>
