<p class="noPspace">Hey friends,</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">This is Andrew Peters, your friendly team lead for the April Mumbai 2012 trip. Hopefully youve all heard that the team arrived safe and sound (including a seamless transfer for one of our participants from the domestic terminal), and after an astonishing ZERO bags lost and less than 1 hour after landing, our tired heads hit the pillow.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays been an "ease into Mumbai" sort of day (if thats possible). What went wrong? Our driver hit an auto rickshaw driver and knocked his rear view mirror off. What went right? Our driver rear ended a motorcycle and made him fall over. Other than that it was fairly uneventful. Great food, some shopping, and some cultural landmarks (plus plenty of driving). Oh, and it was hot and smuggy, and Mumbai smelled a like saur kraut today.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Most folks were falling asleep over their plates tonight, so as of 9:30pm most folks had turned towards bed. Todays visual? A quick reminder a few of us got within 15 seconds of the "haves" and "have-nots" that co-exist here. Good night friends and family.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">We love you!</p>

<p class="noPspace">The team</p>

<p class="noPspace">P.S. Additionally, this week well be hearing from a first time international  traveler (and Go participant) named Brandon. We all look forward to  hearing his perspective on his first time out of the US, and first time  serving in this capacity. Thanks for sharing with us Brandon. Enjoy!  (See Below)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>Well, were not in Ohio anymore, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say that so far Mumbai has given us a warm, and slightly overwhelming welcome, but before all that, lets start from the beginning. My name is Brandon Rose and I am a volunteer at Crossroads and a first time international traveler, so from day one in December when I found out that I had been accepted to go on the Mumbai trip, I have been absolutely looking forward to this experience. Send off day couldnt come quickly enough over the months and I was so thankful that everyones arrival at CVG went through without a hitch and was quickly followed by a swift passage through security and onto a long flight to Paris. Though we may have been a bit restless, the flight was over soon enough and we found ourselves with some free time to get some French coffee and do some window shopping around the airports high end stores. Security in France, like Cincinnati, was uneventful despite a few of us getting pulled aside for bag checks.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>On board our next flight, we settled in for an equally lengthy trip that eventually found us landing safe and sound in Mumbai 21 hours after we had left home. Tired and excited, the first steps off the plane reminded us that we were in a new world, and after getting waved through customs without a second glance, we boarded the bus that was already waiting for us. Blessings sometimes may come in disguise, but the safe travel and quick transport through our various airports are an obvious blessing to all. Once finally at the hotel with our bags in our rooms, some of us went straight to sleep while others found trouble drifting off with all the sights, sounds and new excitement surrounding us. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Today, still tired from our flight, we had our first opportunity to experience some authentic Indian culture when we went out to visit to the home of Ghandi, and then on to the markets where we could shop around. The drive across the city, both to and from the markets in our personal cars, was eye opening to say the least as to what may lay ahead in the upcoming days. We arent in Ohio anymore, thats for sure, and with a great amount of divine intervention from the Lord, completely through HIm, this trip seems like it will but nothing but amazing for all. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em><br></em></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Heres to a great week!</em></p>
