<p>The House of God</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Jesus, help me to hear what you say about prayer, and then help me actually do it.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:15-17&amp;version=NIV"><em>Mark 11:15-17</em></a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. Jesus describes the Temple (the place where God dwelled with the Israelites) as a house of prayer. He didnt call it a house of religion, a house of perfection, a house of exclusiveness. He called it a house of prayer. The way Jesus described Gods earthly home is one built on prayer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If God lives in a house of prayer, what does that mean for our own lives? For our own homes?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is foundational to Gods Kingdom. Its foundational to a believers life. Take the next few minutes and pray for God to strengthen your foundation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 10</a></p>
