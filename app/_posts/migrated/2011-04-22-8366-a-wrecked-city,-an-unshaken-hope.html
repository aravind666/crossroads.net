<p>A Wrecked City, An Unshaken Hope</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, give me perspective on my current circumstances and your strength to see past them.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%202:%2017-18&amp;version=NIV">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a> (or read the whole book)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Nehemiah came home to ruin. Buildings were wrecked, homes destroyed, the wall in pieces. Doubters and enemies surrounded him. There is nothing about his situation that would inspire any kind of confidence or optimism.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But like Daniel and the lion trap, Nehemiah looked beyond the circumstance. He saw his homeand his peoplenot as the fearful, oppressed people they were, but as the free, fulfilled people God had made them to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the endgame of freedom: seeing the freedom that God offers in the broader world around you (and for the generations who follow you) and having the audacity to believe that God wants you to help make it happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend a few minutes asking God to show you how you can help someone else in their journey toward the freedom he offers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 2</a></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the history that weve all learned and seen, our natural tendency is to equate slavery with physical hardship and restriction. While it certainly can mean this, God seems to have a bigger picture of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever felt like you were able to step back from your situation and see the bigger picture? If not, what keeps you tied to the immediate? </li>
<li>Where do you need perspective or strength, today, to see the bigger picture? (Maybe this is a time for setting up some accountability with another person or asking for prayer in that area.)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The natural progression of freedomphysical or otherwiseleads to our involvement in the freedom of others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you see any opportunities in your life right now where God is giving you the chance to help lead someone else into more of his freedom? </li>
<li>What would encourage you to move forward with that? What could hold you back?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
