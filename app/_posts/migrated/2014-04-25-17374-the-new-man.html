<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to prepare you for a new way of thinking.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+16%3A13-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 16:13-14</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our culture is full of images, movies and YouTube videos that tell us what a man is. They say that drinking a lot, lifting a lot and farting a lot makes a man. But the Bible is full of men who set an example of what God says about manhood and how they should live---men set a vision for their lives and diligently work at it; men nurture and protect their communities; men are team players and stand up to fear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Over the next few weeks, The Daily will take a deeper look at what the Bible says about manhood.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What do you think a man should look or act like and where did you come up with this image? Spend some time thinking about if these traits are from God or a cultural myth.</p>
