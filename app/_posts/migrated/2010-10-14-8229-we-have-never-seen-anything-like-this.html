<p>We Have Never Seen Anything Like This</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to thank God for the amazing ways he has shown up in your life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Mark%202:6-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Mark 2:6-12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When people encounter Jesus amazing things happen. And yet even though Jesus made a lame man walk again, the greater miracle in this story is that the man went away forgiven and made right with God. The greatest miracle God does is transform hearts.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Thank God for the many transformed hearts in our Crossroads community. Ask Him to continue changing yours.</p>
