<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Carry On: Relax</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week well look at remaining in rhythms, by focusing on different portions of Psalm 116. Read the passage, and then reread the first line. Thats where well focus today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20116:7-8&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Psalm 116:7-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You may be a constant worker, and choosing to be still or relax is a tough choice for you. Alternatively, you may struggle with a lack of get-up-and-go, but without solid times of work, your rest may be restless. Either way, choosing genuine peace and trust in God--the best kind of rest--is just that, a choice. This passage starts with I said to myself. Beginning good rhythms that form habits of working from rest might need to start with forming a new internal dialogue.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write this verse on a notecard, post-it, or piece of paper and place it somewhere where you can see it regularly throughout your week.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 20</a></p>
