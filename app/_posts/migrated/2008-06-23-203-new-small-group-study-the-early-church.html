<html><body><p>If you're looking for something to study in your small group, check out <em>The Early Church</em>, a new seven-week study focusing on the experiences of
the first followers of Jesus. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that we
have to be just like the early church, but certainly Jesus first
followers were intimately aware of his teachings, and thankfully wrote
down what it was like for them. Each week has some reading, some Bible
verses to reference, and questions to talk over with your small group. You can download it <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/documents/TheEarlyChurch_WEB_1.pdf" target="_blank" title="The Early Church Study Guide">here. </a></p></body></html>
