<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is a Protector</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our culture has a lot to say about manhood, but God says something different about it. Over the next few weeks, The Daily will take a look at what the Bible says about manhood.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for the ways hes protected you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+4%3A14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Nehemiah 4:14</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Nehemiah was rebuilding Jerusalems walls and re-claiming the city for his family and community all while up against possible war. Like Nehemiah, men protect their families and communities from small daily struggles and through big moments of loss or pain. A father can protect his daughter by buckling her carseat. A brother can protect his sister by holding her hand and crossing the street. A husband can protect his wife when she loses her own father. No matter the relationship, a man is a protector.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Just as God is a protector, we are called to protect each other. Today, look for a way to protect someone in your family, group of friends or coworkers.</p>
