<html><body><p class="noPspace">How big is the problem of human trafficking? In his book <a title="Amazon Link" href=""><em>Disposable People,</em></a> Kevin Bales claims that there are more slaves than at any other point in human history, and they are cheaper than ever. There are 27 million slaves worldwide, who are treated as “disposable people.”<br><br>For perspective, at the height of the slave trade in America, there were an estimated 3.8 million slaves who each cost the equivalent of $40,000. Today, there are an estimated 27 million slaves around the world who cost $90 on average. Meanwhile, traffickers are profiting an estimated <a href="">$31.6 billion</a> per year while forcing their victims to work for nothing more than basic subsistence.<br><br>The front lines of the human trafficking battle are in India, where more than 1 million children are in forced prostitution. That’s why we are working there to improve the quantity and quality of aftercare for rescued girls.<br><br>We are committed to this work because, in the eyes of God, there are no disposable people. These children are made in the image of God, and therefore have infinite worth. In Psalm 10,  God reminds us that he “hear[s] the desire of the afflicted; [he] will incline [his] ear to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.”</p></body></html>
