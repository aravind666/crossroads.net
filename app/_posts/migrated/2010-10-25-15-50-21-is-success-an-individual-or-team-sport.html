<p class=\"noPspace\">There&rsquo;s a common  belief that achievement is only about the individual&rsquo;s effort, pulling  ourselves up by our bootstraps, working harder, making our own way. This  same expectation is often applied to people in poverty&mdash;that simply  applying more effort individually should be enough to overcome a tough  situation.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Yet in Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s book <a title=\"Amazon link\" href=\"http&#58;//www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922\">Outliers&#58; The Story of Success</a>, he writes,  that &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been far too focused on the individual&mdash;on describing the  characteristics and habits and personality traits of those who get  furthest ahead in the world....(W)hen outliers become outliers it is not  just because of their own efforts. It&rsquo;s because of the contributions of  lots of different people and lots of different circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">If this is  true of the most successful people, what is true for those who are  facing significant barriers and limited resources? According to poverty  expert Dr. Ruby Payne, one of the most important resources needed to  move from poverty to self-sufficiency is a strong support system. But what about  personal effort? It&rsquo;s &nbsp;still an essential component to personal  advancement; however, it&rsquo;s not the only factor.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Consider the  story of Olympic gold medalist and world-class swimmer Michael Phelps&#58; Because swimming is primarily an individual  sport, Michael Phelps&rsquo; accomplishments are  purely his own. &nbsp;But how did he become such an exceptional swimmer, and  what contributed to his success?</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">It started with a combination of  natural talent and hard work, but beyond that there were other  contributors. His mother was able to access opportunities at local swim  leagues, where he was then connected to coaches and trainers who built his confidence and refined his skills. These coaches had expertise and  knowledge about being an Olympian, as well as connections to facilities  and resources that built his skills over time. And even Michael&rsquo;s teammates played a role, providing him with a competitive atmosphere  that pushed him to perform. In the end, his success was the result of  both personal effort and community support.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Moving from  poverty to self-sufficiency requires the same combination&mdash;it takes a  personal commitment as well as a supportive community. That&rsquo;s how  CityLink Center can change the game, not only by integrating social  services, but also by providing mentors and coaches who can help  individuals break the cycle of generational poverty.</p>
