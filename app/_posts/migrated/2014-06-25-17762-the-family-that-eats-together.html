<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Church was created to be big and small---like family. Its a place for everyone to come and experience something new about God, then put what we learn to practice with the people we encounter every day. Our family is the person we sit next to, a small group, and the guy who brews our coffee. Were all part of the family that Jesus calls the church.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Share a meal with at least one person in your family. If it turns into a party, even better. <a href="http://youtu.be/Sh2v1XfQ-SE">Just make sure youve got plenty of food</a>.</p>
