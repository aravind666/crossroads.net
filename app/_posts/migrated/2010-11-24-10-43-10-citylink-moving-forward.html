<p class="noPspace">Over the last decade, our community at Crossroads has been concerned for the poor right here in our city. Dozens of volunteers have helped to build homes through Habitat of Humanity; hundreds of volunteers have been quietly and faithfully serving meals at City Gospel Mission on a Friday nights and on Thanksgiving Day; and thousands of families have given generously during the holiday season through Thanksgiving Food Drive and Angel Tree gifts to children whose parent is incarcerated and have served our city through Go Cincinnati.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Through the amazing generosity of our community, we can truly change the game of poverty in Cincinnati. In 2011, we&rsquo;ll break ground on our property at 800 Bank Street from which we&rsquo;ll be able to provide bundled services&mdash;employment, financial and other critical support services&mdash;as well as health and wellness programs.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also be able to provide barrier removal services such as childcare and transportation for our clients.&nbsp; The hundreds of committed volunteers who have mentored kids through WhizKids and adults looking for employment through TeamWorks have given us a taste of the life change that is possible through CityLink Center&rsquo;s job coaching and mentoring programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="noPspace">We are changing the game in Cincinnati, and the best is yet to come. Check back to crossroads.net for updates on our work with CityLink.</p>
