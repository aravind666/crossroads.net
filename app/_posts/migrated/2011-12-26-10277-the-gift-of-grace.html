<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204%3A23&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">Philippians 4:23</a>(The Message)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Ask God to fill you with his amazing grace. Be open to what He says about you.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Frederick Buechner, writer and theologian, on grace:</p>

<p class="noPspace">"Grace is something you can never get but only be given. Theres no way to earn it or deserve it or bring it about any more than you can deserve the taste of raspberries and cream or earn good looks or bring about your own birth. A good sleep is grace and so are good dreams. Most tears are grace. The smell of rain is grace. Somebody loving you is grace. Loving somebody is grace...</p>

<p class="noPspace">The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldnt have been complete without you. Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Dont be afraid. I am with you. Nothing can ever separate us. It is for you I created the universe."</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take a break today from feeling anything close to "less than." Repeat the word "grace" as a reminder when youre getting stuck.</p>
