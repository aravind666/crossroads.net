<p class="noPspace"><strong>Work: Purpose</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This is the final week of hearing from God about how to love our work. Well look at the book of Colossians and its wise words on living and working.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LkiE-pf64yEXuCFnWCzhPTo4XtECuZGjFAWSGX35Wq0Btb7LuwToLM9oee5dkzUetetSuz1qc8tbYWnyYJIsxBkHdyCD3QlqBLJ-NomacccMeQxApUICtGBQikBbcgYOf2b8Cil2mlKgYQZAjtk4uopuL7o7hCFTMoGRU_eTwg0JhMRpnEs8ep43ck6qhL-PxVF4jKaAKKpCR2HEfyx6AQ==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Colossians 1:3-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The Book of Colossians was originally a letter that the apostle Paul wrote to Christ-followers in the town of Colosse. he began by encouraging the Colossians, and celebrating the purpose behind their faith.</p>
<p class="noPspace">All of us desire a purposeful life, to believe that there is meaning to what we do and contribute. Like the Colossians, may "purpose in our lives never grow slack" while we keep our focus and hope on God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think about areas of your life where you are experiencing purpose and fruit. How can you focus your energy towards fruitful things, not just putting out fires?</p>
