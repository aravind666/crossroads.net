<p class="noPspace">32 Crossroads people recently returned from an outstanding 10-day trip to South Africa. Heres a recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our team was made up of dentists, business experts, teachers, physicians, nurses, counselors, Crossroads staff, volunteers, first-time South Africa visitors and veteran GO trip participants.</li>
<li>The trip began on an adventurous note: we had a 15-hour delay at the Atlanta airport, which included spending the night on the airport floor.</li>
<li>Once we arrived, our time was split between Grace Bible Church in Soweto and the Topsy Foundation in Mpumalanga. These two potential partners are world-class, game-changing organizations.</li>
<li>We worked alongside both organizations on whatever they were doing. We also delivered dental care, provided leadership training for the staffs of both organizations, and hosted a celebratory breakfast for 120 grandmothers who are caring for HIV/AIDS orphans. Most importantly, we spent time with the two organizations to see how we get along and to show them what Crossroads is all about.</li>
<li>Grace Bible Church and the Topsy Foundation were both recipients of food containers from our most recent Thanksgiving Food Drive. It was very cool to see firsthand where that food was used.</li>
<li>Our goal with both organizations is to continue building relationships by simply spending more time together. That will mean more trips for us to South Africa, and more trips for them to Cincinnati.</li>
<li>We spent time scouting new areas of the country. We visited Soweto, the epicenter of the anti-Apartheid resistance. We also spent time in the rural Mpumalanga province; rural South Africa is where health problems are often the worst.</li>
<li>Were still investigating other game-changing organizations in South Africa, approaching our future there with open minds and open hearts.</li>
</ul>
