<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Friday, November 27</strong><br>New Relationships<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.<br><br></em><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 4:1-6<br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>At the same time that God removed the barriers that kept us from him, he also removed the things that separate us from one another. Racial divides. Gender divides. Background. Talents. Social status. <br><br>God is passionate about unity among his followers. He has made us one with each other as well as with him.<br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Go back and read the passage again, intentionally focusing on any words that stand out in your mind.<br><br>Write down (on a piece of paper or in a journal) the key words or phrases that struck you.<br><br>Ask God to show you how these phrases apply to relationships in your life. Write down any insights that come to mind.<br><br>Today is the two-week mark of our journey through Ephesians. If you havent already done so, we recommend that you get a journal of some kind, as there will be an exercise at the end of Ephesians where youll need it. Getting into the practice of journaling the thoughts and experiences that come to you as you spend time with God will prove invaluable as you continue growing in your relationship with him. <br>______________________________<br><strong><br>Week 2 Discussion Questions</strong><br>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily. <br><br>One of the driving principles for this week is the idea that Jesus is the foundation and driving force for everything. He provides the power, the love, the energy, the strength. While we may agree with this in our heads, it can be easy to forget in the midst of daily life.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>What areas of your life make it hard for you to remember this foundation?</li>
<li>What can you do in those moments to remember and trust Jesus?</li>
</ul>God has removed the barriers that separate us from him, as well as the things that divide us from one another. The practical result of this is that when we connect with Him, our behavior and life change not out of guilt or obligation, but because we have connected with the fullness of his love.<br><ul>
