<p>Anticipation</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hosea%206:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hosea 6:1-7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>These verses in Hosea foreshadow Jesus coming. Can you hear it? </p>
<p></p>
<p>It was always Gods plan to partner with his people to bless the rest of the world, to show everyone his full character and to redeem us. He started with Adam, wanting Adam to spread Eden. Then He tells Abraham, Im going to bless you so you can bless other peoples. Next, He moves on to work through the Hebrew nation through Judges and Kings. And then, through King David in Psalms, and again in the books of the prophets, we start to hear about the coming of a Messiah.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus is coming. Can you feel the anticipation?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>In Hosea 6:6, it says that the Lord desires mercy, not sacrifice. This week, how can you show mercy to yourself and others to show the world Gods character?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Malachi%204:1-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Malachi 4:1-6</a>. These final words in the Old Testament book of Malachi also foreshadow Jesus coming.</p>
