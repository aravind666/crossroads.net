<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>All Ye Faithful: Heavenly Host</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The shepherds were considered a dirty group, but God chose them to announce the birth of Jesus. They were keeping watch in the fields until He showed up in a big way.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>LISTEN</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What seemed to be a routine night in the fields became one of the most extraordinary stories ever told. The shepherds kept watch over their flock when the night sky lit up with the company of heaven. They were frightened---you would be, too, if youd never seen an angel before.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">But the angel calmed their fears and told them the great and joyful news that the Savior of all the people had been born in Bethlehem. And the angel rejoiced with all of heaven right in front of the shepherds eyes. When the angels had left, they rushed to the little town and found Mary, Joseph and the baby just as the angel had said.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The shepherds did not keep the story to themselves. They were told the Savior was for all people and so they told everyone they met.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus came to love all people. Share the Christmas story with someone in your sphere of influence whether they know it or are hearing it for the first time. It might seem a bit weird, but trust God to give you the words to tell his story.</p>
