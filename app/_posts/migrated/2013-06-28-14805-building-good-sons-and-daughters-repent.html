<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Building Good Sons and Daughters: Repent</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Concentrate today on verse 32, understanding that repentance is an action step.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:28-32&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Matthew 21:28-32</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God is all about forgiveness. Although the son in the parable initially said no, later he repented. Repenting of things in our lives opens up space for a relationship with God and the Holy Spirit to enter. If we hold on to the things we think God will never forgive us for, we arent believing in the absolute grace that God offers. Repenting is an action step.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, repent of things that you are saying no to and truly believe that you can receive Gods forgiveness. Try practicing repentance with someone else. Have that person bless you when you are finished.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 6 </a></p>
