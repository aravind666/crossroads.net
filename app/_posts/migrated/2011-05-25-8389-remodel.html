<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>God, show me how to get out of the way and make room for you in my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%203:8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 3:8</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Todays verse says that the result of repentance (changing your beliefs and turning to God) is fruit. In<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:22-23&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, this fruit includes love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Sometimes repentance is just about getting out of your own way and making room for the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Heres what someone recently said about repentance:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I always think of repentance as raising the white flag...My attitude is that I am someone who needs saving and God is the one who saves.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Is there something that keeps coming to mind as you read about repentance? Something you want to change or something you at least want to talk to God about changing? Take a minute to raise the white flag and ask God if theres anything he wants you to surrender.</p>
<p><strong><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong> <br>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2025&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 25</a></p>
