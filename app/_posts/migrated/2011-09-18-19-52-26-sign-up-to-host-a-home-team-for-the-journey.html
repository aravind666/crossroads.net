<html><body><p>Six weeks. 50,000 teammates. Are you up for this year’s journey, <a title="Strong Challenge Website" href="">Strong Challenge</a>? The Strong Challenge isn’t a race, but it is a commitment—for 20 minutes a day, five days a week for six weeks, we’ll experiment with challenges and rhythms designed to open us up to the God who spiritually strengthens us. We need home team (small group) hosts to make it happen. Sign up today and post your group at <a title="Strong Challenge website" href="">strongchallenge.com.</a></p></body></html>
