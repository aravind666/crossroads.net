<html><body><p>(Caution: May contain spoilers if your group hasn’t met)<br><br>For week two of the journey, we met at Crossroads, along with a bunch of other groups. It was great to see the atrium so full of life on a regular Tuesday night. <br><br>We chewed our gum (A little tip: Don’t keep your host kit in the car all day or your gum balls will be frozen.) and chewed on the issues we were facing in the journey.<br><br>One person in my group goes to a church that is not participating in Consumed, but she wanted to do the journey anyway. Last week when we showed up, she didn’t even know what Consumed was about (she’d just gotten her guide yet). And last night, she told us that she already committed to going on a spending fast—she’s not spending anything materialistic for herself for six months. <br><br>I shared some about where I am on my materialism journey: I don’t spend a lot, because I bargain shop. But I still buy things I don’t need, for no apparent reason, spending money that I could put to better uses. I’m determined to start a red-tag head check on my clearance binges. <br><br>We also shared the ways that we were grateful.  We shared a lot of the same things—husbands, kids, warm houses, food on our tables, and then it evolved into a conversation about how lucky we are. It seems so trite, but when you really stop to consider the genocide in Darfur, Kosovars struggling to gain independence and people in Mamelodi, South Africa living in informal settlements struggling to meet basic needs, our “needs” pale in comparison. God has given us so much.<br><br>So, when the email came out today announcing that the ipod shuffle is now only $49, I reminded myself I don’t need another one, no matter how cheap it is. <br></p></body></html>
