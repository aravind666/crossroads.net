<p><strong>Thursday, February 4<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Redeemed</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%203:10-14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 3:10-14<br></a>(Click to view the scripture online.)</span></strong></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">To redeem means to buy back, to pay off, to value something.</span></strong></p>
<p>When Paul says that Jesus redeemed us from the curse of the law, hes setting up the contradiction between law and grace. Hes saying that we no longer have to struggle to get Gods favor or work hard to make him notice us. None of this is possible; our effort would be wasted. Instead, as soon as we choose to follow Jesus, we get to receive his gift of grace and know that we are loved. No strings attached.</p>
<p>Something is worth what (or who) is paid for it. Jesus paid for us. As hard as it might be to believe, we hold the same value as Gods son.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does it feel to know you are so valued by God that Jesus died for you?</li>
<li>Have you ever thanked God for what hes done?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Not only are we redeemed through Jesus, but Paul says we also receive the blessing given to Abraham. Take a few more minutes today to read the passages below that describe the blessings that come from a relationship with Jesus. Write down the ones that stand out to you and carry those around on a sheet of paper as a reminder.</span></strong></p>
