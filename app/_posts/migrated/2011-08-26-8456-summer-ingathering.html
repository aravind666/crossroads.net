<p>Summer: Ingathering</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for giving me the ability to work. May you also teach me to rest.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Your  soul is at risk when you forget to rest and let go. No exaggeration. In  our American culture, we tend to think we can (and need to) do it all.  We worry that everything will fall apart without us--that we are so  very, very important. We are, indeed, priceless. But only because the  Creator of the universe is planted in us. We cant earn that value. We  must pause, and revel in it. We must rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rest  doesnt necessarily mean lying on the couch, eating Cheetos, and  watching TV. It might. But it might also mean getting out and moving  around in what God has made. Resting in the Lord means not controlling,  but receiving. Take a day to enjoy God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Plan  a Sabbath. Schedule it and decide what you want it to look like. If it  doesnt seem fun enough to motivate you to do it, re-plan a day that  will.</p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The  Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the  weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with  your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also  subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Summer  is a season to try loving through serving and moving. Its also a  season to tend to your inner life. A great way to really grow is to do  it in community, and discuss that inner stuff. Inviting people into your  inner life is a good discipline to form in the summer season.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share  something that you would really rather not. Whats something you dont  want folks to know about you? Think back to the rocks.</li>
<li>Talk about your weeds. What are you struggling to release or add to your life?</li>
<li>Talk about Sabbath: Is it happening for you or not. Where could you start?</li>
<li>Have  you considered what season you might be in? Still in spring, reveling  in a newness with God? Or maybe summer, as you have put your love into  action for the Kingdom? Discuss.</li>
</ul>
