<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Overcomes Obstacles</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will consider what it means for the New Man to have a vision.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you overcome and prepare for obstacles.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A33&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 16:33</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve heard the only thing certain in life is change. Jesus even said that we would have trouble, that life would be hard. Having a vision and working at it is just as hard. We hope to get better at overcoming hardship and managing trouble, but sometimes wed rather skip the hard stuff and take the easy route. The New Man pushes through those barriers and stays the course because he knows that Jesus will lead and strengthen him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Maybe youve hit a bump in the road or one is coming around the bend. Whatever is happening today, lean into Jesus. Hell get you over the bump in the road.</p>
