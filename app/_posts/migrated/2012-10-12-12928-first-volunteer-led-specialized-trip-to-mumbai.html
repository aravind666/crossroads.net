<p class="noPspace">In August, four Crossroads volunteers traveled to Mumbai to conduct the first of several pastoral care seminars for Maharashtra Baptist Society (MBS) church leaders. Crossroads uses small, specialized trips to leverage the skills and experience of Crossroads volunteers to build into and help equip our church partners who give trafficking survivors a place to call home.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">We were thrilled to take our Game Change commitment to a whole new level by serving in India together, said teachers John and Camille Prado. Along with counselors Steve Andry and Usha Sklena, the team presented a two-day seminar, called Listening for Heavens Sake, to 34 MBS pastors and their wives, and the Crossover Foundation staff. The seminar focused on how to listen reflectively with warmth, empathy and respect, so the one speaking feels safe, valued and heardthe foundation of effective communication and counseling skills. These skills are critical to the local Indian churches who are not only providing aftercare homes for survivors, but who will also be the primary source of social support for survivors when they graduate from aftercare and reintegrate into society.</p>

<p class="noPspace">When Crossover President Keith Dsouza asked the pastors how the training helped them, one senior pastor said, Theres a great need for counselors in our city. We have been praying for 10 years for training for the pastors to be better counselors, and God answered our prayers today. In two days, it was like two years of training. MBS leader Pastor Vivian Fernandes expressed, Im so happy because I heard one pastor using the listening skills on the phone at tea break. Keith concluded, Our dream for pastoral care training has come true, and this is one of many trainings to come. If the pastors are strengthened, they will bless and strengthen others.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Our volunteers were also blessed and strengthened through the experience. John Prado expressed, We were impressed and challenged by the church leaders and Crossover staffs unwavering faith, humility and dependence on God in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Likewise, Camille Prado shared an experience that deeply impacted her: We had the privilege of interacting with the young women at the first two group homes Crossover and MBS just opened. We were amazed at their hopeful outlook, despite all they have suffered. We believe that because people in our community are obeying Godfervently praying, generously giving and walking in faithlike Gods people in India, together we are changing the game, Gods Kingdom is advancing, and many other survivors will experience that same hope soon.</p>
