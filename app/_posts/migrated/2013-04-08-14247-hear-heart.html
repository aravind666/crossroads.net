<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Friday, April 12</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we finish out our week of looking at Jesus teaching in Luke 12 by reading through the whole thing together with the last two verses in place.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2012:22-34&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Luke 12:22-34</a></span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do you want to feel purpose in your life and hear Gods voice directing your life? God wants to nudge your heart. He wants you to hear him speaking to you. One way to make sure you can hear Gods voice and move with ease in his ways, is to make sure he is the only one who has real estate in your heart. When God has to battle with our other distractions, it gets difficult to hear.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Earlier this week you spent time looking at where in your life you experience worry. Today, journal about how it would look if you reinvested the things that stress you toward Gods kingdom.</p>
