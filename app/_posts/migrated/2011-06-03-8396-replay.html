<p><strong>Friday, June 3 </strong><br>Replay</p>
<p><br><em>God, help me focus on your character and love today.<br></em></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2019&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 19</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Receiving from God often starts with worshiping him. Worship can be anything that helps us replay for our hearts the truth about Gods character and his love. A great way to do that is to praise Him, thank him for what hes done in your life and tell him what you love about him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The book of Psalms (the big one near the middle of the Bible) is full of prayers of praise and worship. A great way to start thanking God is to pray through one of these Psalms. Take Psalm 19 (what you read today). Read through it and use your own words to translate Psalm 19 into your own prayer of thanks to God.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider what it would look like for you to have a regular rhythm of changing whats not working in your life and filling that space with receiving from God. What would it look like and how can you start?</p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT <br></strong>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 4</a></p>
