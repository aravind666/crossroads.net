<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>The Vine: Fruit</p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue in the Message this week, as Jesus teaches us the rhythms of abiding. Yesterday we looked at abiding with the vine through pruning, and today we look at a season for fruit.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Unlike branches that cannot choose on their own to disconnect from the vine, God gave us the ability to make our own choices. Sometimes when the going gets rough we retreat into the vine, and we look for God, the gardener, to tend to us. Yet, when fruit begins to come we want to take credit or say Thanks God, Ive got it from here.What might it look like in our lives if we had natural rhythms of retreating with Him, and remaining in him as we work and produce?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Ask God how he wants to you to remain in him, throughout your day.</p>
