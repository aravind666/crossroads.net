<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Protects Spiritually</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to explore what the Bible says about men. This week, well focus on how the New Man is a protector.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pray to God and ask him to show you how you can build community.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;interface=print">John 10:10</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A10-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 6:10-18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There is an enemy who seeks to rob and distract us from Gods love and abundance. Its like a toothpaste commercial when the bacteria attacks the teeth. The bad news is these distractions can sometimes seem endless, but Paul tells us in Ephesians that we can wear the <a href="http://crossroadskidsclub.net/portfolio/gods-story-armor-of-god/">Armor of God</a> to protect us from the enemys plan. The New Man is a spiritual protector and the best way to put on Gods armor is to pray often and encourage others gently.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Who in your life needs spiritual protection? Today, put on your armor and pray for their specific protection.</p>
