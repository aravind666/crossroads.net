<html><body><p>Despite my snide comments about bloggers, here I am blogging (and eating humble pie). I’m told that giving thoughts periodically on our site could be healthy and helpful for our community, so here goes…<br> <br>This was an awkward message for me to give this weekend. For starters, we did ministry reviews during the week with all of the ministry areas. <em>On the positive side</em>, I was encouraged by how great things are going in so many ministries as a result of how God is moving at Crossroads. <em>On the negative side</em>, it really set me back for my weekend message prep. <br><br>Then I had another moose on the table that was staring me in the eyes: the belief that you shouldn't talk too much about the person of the Holy Spirit because it will either <em>freak people out  </em>or it will disturb people because what is said may not match their personal experience. On the whole, I think that our community is responding great to stuff that is often mysterious, sometimes divisive but always healthy.<br> <br>This weekend, I referenced some work that I did in outlining every person’s experience with the Holy Spirit as seen in the book of Acts. <strong>Below are my results straight from my journal.</strong> I think you’ll find that there is no standardized, linear process that the Holy Spirit takes in revealing Himself and in filling individuals.
