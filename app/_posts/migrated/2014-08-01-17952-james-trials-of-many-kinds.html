<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Trials of Many Kinds</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily is in the midst of a study on the book of James. We went wide last week, reading the entire book of James over five days. This week, were going deep---focusing on the same passage all week long, digging into what it has to say to us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 1:2-4</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When James talked about trials of many kinds, he wasnt kidding around. The people to whom he was writing had been scattered throughout the Roman empire because of their belief in Jesus. Theyd been beaten, thrown into prison and even killed. And this persecution was often driven by their own people--others of Jewish descent who felt threatened by this growing movement of Christ-followers.</p>
