<p class=\"noPspace\">Someone once said, &ldquo;God meets each of us where we are, but he doesn&rsquo;t leave us there.&rdquo; Read about how God used the GO India trip experience to change the lives of three brave Crossroads volunteers who sought to bring hope to survivors of sex trafficking in India.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em><strong>Three people, open to God&rsquo;s call to GO India&hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Meet Elizabeth K. </strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">The moment she heard that Crossroads was pursuing a trip to India to serve girls who were rescued from sex trafficking, she was in! She started working at a part-time job and saved for three years waiting on God&rsquo;s timing. Not known for her patience, Elizabeth considers it a minor miracle that she was able to stay focused until she felt God prompting her to GO India in October 2012.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Meet Todd. </strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">He signed up for GO India February 2009 mainly because his wife was going and he didn&rsquo;t want her to go alone. Their trip occurred right after the attacks in Mumbai in which over 200 people were shot and killed. He wanted to bail, but his wife and Crossroads trip leaders were unswerving. &ldquo;So I pretty much went 100% against my will!&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>Meet Elizabeth S.</strong></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Going to India was the only time she&rsquo;s ever known without a doubt that God was telling her to do something. Having experienced healing on her own journey, she wanted to be part of encouraging others on their journeys. God &ldquo;convinced me that my story didn&rsquo;t make me broken, but&nbsp;it actually qualified me for this kind of mission.&rdquo; She went in October 2011.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">All witnesses to God&rsquo;s work in India&hellip;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>In the rescued girls.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">On a bus trip to camp, Elizabeth K. sat next to a shy, quiet girl who had just been rescued from sex trafficking. Despite the language barrier, the two made a connection. With Elizabeth by her side, the girl slowly started to open up and make friends. She even began to smile.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>In their own hearts.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">After spending three days in an aftercare home with rescued girls, Todd accepted Christ in front of a KFC in Mumbai with about 20 children tugging on his clothes and asking for money. &ldquo;It was crazy. My heart was shattered, [and] my perception of the world was rocked. Clear as day I felt [Jesus] telling me that following him was not easy, but that&rsquo;s what I needed to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>In the Indian Church. </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Elizabeth S. believes that it&rsquo;s easy to be a Christian in America.&nbsp;But if Christians in India want a church to worship Jesus in, they have to build it.&nbsp;If they want a school for their kids, they have to start it. She reflects, &ldquo;They depend on God so much, for everything, but here in America, we depend on everything&nbsp;except God. I realized I had some maturing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">And it changed their lives&hellip;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Opening her home.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Since her GO trip, Elizabeth K. has felt God prompting her to take foster parenting classes. &ldquo;I do not have to be in India to help young girls who have been taken advantage of sexually. I would like to open my home to young mothers or pregnant teens who are not yet able to be on their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Giving and GO-ing back.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">After seeing how people in India lived on so little, Todd and his wife Catie amped up their giving&mdash;tithing to Crossroads, giving above and beyond to Game Change, and supporting some other organizations. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen God show up in crazy ways as we continue to give more and more away. We just know God will provide and he has every single time!&rdquo; Todd just returned to India this month, serving as a GO India trip leader to Kolkata.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Fighting trafficking in the U.S. </em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">When Elizabeth S. returned home,&nbsp;she discovered that trafficking doesn&rsquo;t only happen overseas. She joined an organization called PATH (Partnership Against the Trafficking of Humans) in Northern Kentucky that rescues and serves&nbsp;victims of trafficking here in our neighborhoods.&nbsp; She has also joined International Justice Mission (IJM)&rsquo;s state advocacy campaign, and is assembling a group of advocates in Kentucky to lobby for anti-trafficking laws.</p><p class=\"noPspace\"><em><strong>New to our blog?
