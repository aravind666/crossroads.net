<p class=\"noPspace\">No matter where and what God calls us to, we believe  our  primary call will always be to everyday, average Cincinnatians who are  wrestling with whether there&rsquo;s a God, and if so, if he has any relevance  in their lives. Until every person in Cincinnati has seen their lives  transformed by  Jesus, we&rsquo;re not done. Not done growing. Not done sacrificing. Not done  living out the mission God called 11 people to, 14 years ago. And  whether  we number 10,000 or 100,000, we&rsquo;ll continue to  connect seekers with growing Christ followers who are changing the  world. It&rsquo;s who we are, and who we&rsquo;re called to be.</p>
