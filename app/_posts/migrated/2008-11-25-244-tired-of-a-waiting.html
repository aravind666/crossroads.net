The newly recorded music from <a href="/awaited">Awaited</a> is now available <a href="/media">in the Downloads section</a> for your enjoyment. (Just please...for the sake of us <em>"I don't really engage with Christmas until a month or so out"</em> people... try to refrain from playing it in public until after Thanksgiving...unless you're joining with the retail sector in celebration of Hallo-thanksgiv-mas.)</body></html>
