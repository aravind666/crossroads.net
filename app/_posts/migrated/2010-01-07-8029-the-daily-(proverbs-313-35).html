<strong>T</strong><strong>hursday, January 7</strong><br>Wisdoms Benefits <br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you. </em><br><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Proverbs 3:13-35<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>These verses contain over a dozen benefits that accompany growing in wisdom. For example, wisdom can profit you more than gold. Wisdom can prolong your life. Wisdom can be a protector. Wisdom can keep you from tripping up in life. While these are meant to be illustrative and not necessarily literal, the point is clear: wisdom has benefits. <br><ul><li>When have you benefited from following someones advice? If you had ignored wisdom in this situation, what would have happened?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Think about an area in your life where you are seeking wisdom right now. What benefits could you gain by receiving Gods wisdom before acting in this situation?</li></ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>In the same way that seeking wisdom has benefits, avoiding Gods wisdom has consequences. Today, ask God to help you resist the urge to get ahead of him. Then, thank Him for the benefits youve seen in the past from seeking and responding to wisdom.<br><br><br><strong>A FURTHER LOOK</strong><br>Jeremiah 17:5-8<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">If you are new to The Daily,<a style="color: #3a6e8f; text-decoration: none" href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">click here</a>for tips that will help you get the most out of it.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana"><span> <br><br></span></span>
