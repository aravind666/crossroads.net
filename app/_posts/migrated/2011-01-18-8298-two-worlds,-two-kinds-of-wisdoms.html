<p>Two Worlds, Two Kinds of Wisdoms</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, allow me to see how your wisdom is the root of a good life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%203:13-18&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 3:13-18</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It can feel like were caught between two worlds, because in a very real way, we are. We live with physical bodies in a broken world, with souls longing for the divine. As C.S. Lewis said, You dont have a soul. You are a Soul. You have a body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God has given us the gift of his wisdom to act as a kind of bridge between the two worlds we live in. Only in Gods wisdom can we reconcile the physical with the spiritual, our hearts with our actions, our thoughts with our deeds. When we rely on worldly wisdom that encourages things like, Look out for Number One, or Youve got to keep up with the Joneses, we wont find the true freedom the God offers. And well continue to feel like were at odds, because our souls long for Gods wisdom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Gods wisdom looks like love, sounds like patience and feels like mercy. What is one area where you need Gods wisdom to replace your ownor a worldly wisdom that youve just grown to accept? Mentally circle that area of your life and take action to change it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
