<p><strong>Thursday, February 18<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Seeds</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><em> <br></em></p>
<p><strong>READ<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%206:7-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 6:7-10<br></a>(Click to view the scripture online.)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">You reap what you sow. Many of us have heard this, but we might not know its from the Bible.</span></strong></p>
<p>Paul is telling us we will eventually reap exactly what we sow. Like the farmer who plants good seed and pays attention to his fields will (hopefully) be rewarded with a good crop, we must be conscious of the seeds we are sowing in our life if we wish to experience a good harvest. For example, if we plant seeds of bitterness, the result is isolation. But if we cultivate seeds of forgiveness, the result is rich community and peace. </p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier in the week, we looked at Galatians 5:19-26 and identified a fruit of the Spirit (a good seed) that we want more of in our lives. Whats one opportunity you had this week to exhibit that fruit? If you didnt take that opportunity, what held you back?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Thank God that he offers grace and does not always repay you exactly what you deserve. Ask Him to keep you aware of the kinds of seeds you are sowing in your life, and specific ways to take care of them.</span></strong></p>
