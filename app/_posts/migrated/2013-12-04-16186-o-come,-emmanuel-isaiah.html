<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, The Daily will look at the state of the world when the prophet Isaiah told of the coming Savior.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God called Isaiah to speak to his people and advise the kings of Judah. The kingdom was split and often at war with nearby nations. Isaiah encouraged the kings to obey God. When they were obedient, God would bring Judah victory and prosperity. But the kings were not always obedient and would choose evil over good.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The people of the kingdom had fallen to idols, instead of leaning on their faith in God. Isaiah condemned this; he knew their departure from the Lord would ruin them.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Surrounded by war, idols and bad kings, the people had little hope for freedom. The need for a Savior was great. But Gods rescue plan was in place. Isaiah promised a King who would bring them out of darkness. He would be a counselor, mighty, everlasting and the Prince of Peace.</p>
