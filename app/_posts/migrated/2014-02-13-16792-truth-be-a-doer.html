<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Truth: Be a Doer</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, weve assumed the Bible is only a big book about God and hes the main character. Lets look at one more verse and mull over what it means for us if what it says is true.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to train you to be a doer of his word.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">JAMES 1:22-25</a></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>ASK YOURSELF</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What does your life look like if you choose to not only hear what Jesus says, but do what he says? Does your life change or stay the same?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Jesus wants us to be obedient because he knows that will bring us the greatest freedom. What does obeying God look like for you today? Whether its loving your spouse, doing your work well or forgiving a friend---go and be a doer.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print"> 1 Corinthians 14</a></p>
