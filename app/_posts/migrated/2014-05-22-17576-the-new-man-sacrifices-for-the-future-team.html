<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Sacrifices for the Future Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about how men play on a team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pray to God and ask him to show you how you can build community.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 12:1-7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Abram had a pretty solid life. He was living in Canaan with his family where they lived for a really long time. They were comfortable. And then God asked Abram to pick up his whole life and move away from everything he knew. It would have been a really hard decision to make, but God gave Abram a vision for a team that would change the world. He didnt know what this team would look like, but Abram sacrificed his own doubts and desires for the future of this team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whatever team youre on, think about something you can sacrifice today that will benefit your team next week or next year. Go do it.</p>
