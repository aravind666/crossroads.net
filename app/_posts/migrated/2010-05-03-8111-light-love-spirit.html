<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>How do we grasp the essence of who God is? Over the next two weeks, well be looking closely at some of the core elements of His essence: God as light, love and spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Bible gives us clear pictures of Gods nature, and knowing and understanding his nature provides a foundation for our relationship with him. While it may take some time for us to fully understand how His qualities impact the details of our lives, the exploration is always impactful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But before we dig more deeply into each core aspect of His nature, we should grasp one basic fact:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Light, love and spirit are not qualities or attributes of God. They are God himself. He cannot be anything else. These are not behaviors He puts on. They are who He is.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your first impressions regarding these three aspects belonging to God?</li>
<li>Which one of these aspects of God is most difficult for you to get your heart and mind around?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Tomorrow we will look more closely at God is Light. As you go through your day today, ask God to reveal things around your daily life that illustrate this contrast of light and dark.</p>
