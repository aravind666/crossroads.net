<p>The Accommodator</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Spend time talking with God about any area of your life where you dont feel fully understood or known.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Think  about a recent argument or disagreement that didnt end well. Chances  are, you felt misunderstood as you were trying to make your case.  Consider what would have happened if in the heat of the battle, your  opponent waved the white flag and said, "OK, I understand you." Instead  of the relationship disintegrating in that moment, its restored.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This  parallels the Jesus-as-invitation weve been considering this week. We  were "at odds" with God because our broken nature split us off from a  perfect relationship with him. But in essence God says, "OK, I  understand you" when he sends Jesus to earth. He accommodated us. He  created us for relationship, and the only way to bring that relationship  back to life was with the perfect invitation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Whatever  shape your next disagreement takes, bow out of it. The other person  might be in the wrong, but it makes no difference. Just step aside, even  if you have to do it silently.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
