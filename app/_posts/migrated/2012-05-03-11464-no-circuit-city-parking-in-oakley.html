<p class="noPspace">Do you go to Crossroads Oakley and park in the lot of the former Circuit City? Beginning immediately, please dont. They have a new tenant (liquidator) and you could be towed. Please park at the Annex instead, and thanks for continuing to make space for guests in the main parking lot. In case you forget, well have volunteers to remind you of alternate spots this weekend.</p>
