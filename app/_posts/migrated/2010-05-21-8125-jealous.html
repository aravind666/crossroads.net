<p>Jealous</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We often think of jealousy as negative emotion, which it can be if its based on selfishness. However, there is such a thing as righteous jealousy. For example, in marriage, a spouse should be jealous protecting the other from anyone who wants to entice them away from the marriage commitment. This is not selfish; it is the appropriate expression of their love and commitment to person to whom they are married.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So it is with God. We create idols out of things that we bend our life around with an outpouring of our time, money, talents and affections. And when we do that, God is jealous for us. There is no selfishness in His jealousy. It is the appropriate expression of His love and holiness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What is in your life that pulls you away from your relationship with God? Consider what that thing or person offers you that you dont feel from God. Ask God to show you how he can fulfill you.</p>

<p><strong><br>Week One Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>This week we focused on five characteristics of God: creator, father, holy, forgiving and jealous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of Gods characteristics stuck out to you the most? Consider why, whether its because of past experiences, relationships or things youve been taught. Share that reason, and any new understandings. </li>
<li>Everyone share how they gave someone the benefit of the doubt (Thursdays response) or one thing you feel God revealed to you during the week.<br><br></li>
</ul>
