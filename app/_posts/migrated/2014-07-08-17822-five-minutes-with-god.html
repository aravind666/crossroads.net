<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, were examining our identities as treasured children of God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2031:6&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Deuteronomy 31:6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When Jesus was baptized, everyone who was there literally heard from God: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. We dont always have a physical experience like this, but todays Bible verse promises that God will always be with us--and no matter who "hears" or believes in our worth, we know the value God places on us.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday we compared the differences between orphan mentality and treasured child mentality (<a href="/index.php?action=viewpage&amp;filepath=pages/my/grow//orphanVsChild.htm">see the full list here</a>). Today, choose one orphan statement that stood out to you. Now take that belief to God, asking him to help you walk into the freedom of a treasured child.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God, thank you for always being near to me even when I dont know it. Help me to be brave and courageous.</p>
