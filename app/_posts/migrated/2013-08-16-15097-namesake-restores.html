<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Namesake: Restores</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants you to be all about him. He wants the world to be all about Him--not to puff himself up (hes already big) but to bring the world toward its only hope.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 23:3</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If your soul feels tired and worn out, you wont find peace, strengthening or comfort all on your own. You must find restoration through the Lord. He longs to restore your soul and to clear your path. As you let Him do that, let others see what he has done for you. Pray that He gains access to another persons weary soul--he longs to give love to the weary.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to restore your soul today to refresh you. If you experience refreshing and restoration, tell someone.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 13</a></p>
