<p><strong>Week One: The Power of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, July 18</strong></p>
<p>A Matter of Life and Death</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, teach me about the power of the tongue.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1106584187604&amp;s=0&amp;e=001wiigdP-9NrJwP1GD75kGJNwMyQc2_YuNtrrV_LQQoiP8LR-DwLDWb_R90KSym2rvVeT7n3bSSAhh73f0yZC_SnaIzLZrpjL0X7mg54t306j3hved6VkaLhiibcYZIIYswnHehiRfeT5Ul8tTDzLfDr5ee-elvsxZceYOitsE7lkca_cnoHFwD5f6i0ooEb_ygAmAUwHg3q_nOi77gAdmcQRXnVWjn9eo" target="_blank">Proverbs 18:21</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its  possible that the originator of the infamous nursery rhyme "Sticks and  Stones" had the best of intentions. However, this little saying has been  a twisted source of one of the biggest lies ever spoken. Not only can  "words hurt," the Bible says that they carry the power to speak life or  speak death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over  the next two weeks, well look at where these powerful words come from:  the tongue. The Bible has much to say about this mysterious little  muscle, with all its power and tricks. Well consider questions such as,  "What should my tongue be producing? When should it be still? And why  does it like the taste of my foot so much?"</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Has  anyone ever hurt your feelings with words? Did you try to seek comfort  in the nursery rhyme, "Sticks and Stones?" Or have you ever used that  rhyme to justify hurting someone else? Spend some time today considering  the truth that words have real power. Write down your thoughts.</p>
