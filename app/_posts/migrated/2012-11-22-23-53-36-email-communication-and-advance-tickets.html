<p class="noPspace">Hello 2012 Awaited Cast and Crew!</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">At this time, you should see any Cast and Crew group you are a part of under "My Groups" on the right side of your crossroads.net page. If you are in multiple groups (actors and shepherds, for example) you should see both groups listed. Please let me know right away if you are a part of a group and it is not listed. ALL communication from now on will be via this website so it’s extremely important that you are set up correctly. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>TICKETS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank you for committing to this year’s Awaited production! We created Awaited to share God’s story in a way that our unchurched friends would enjoy and understand. We really appreciate you giving so much time during such a busy season. As a way to say thanks, here’s an early opportunity to get tickets for your friends and family.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We only ask a few simple things</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">First, keep this early link to yourself. Please don’t share this yet; these early tickets are for you, only.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Second, don’t hoard tickets. This show was created for our unchurched friends, and we want as many people as possible to experience Awaited this year. The system only allows you to reserve twelve tickets per email address. So use the link below to score some early seats--but please, just be cool about it.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Third, only sit in prime seats for a single show, max. We not only want as many people as possible to experience Awaited, we want them to have sweet seats.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Fourth, be strategic about which shows you reserve. If you’re getting these tickets for an unchurched friend who may not otherwise hear the Christmas story, then by all means come to any show. But if you’re getting seats for your family, please come to one of the earlier shows in the run, or the first one of a two-show day (first-timers tend to fill up the later shows).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="" target="_blank">Click here to reserve early Awaited tickets.</a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ticketing will open up to the entire Crossroads community on Saturday. Once again, thanks for making Awaited happen this year!</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thanks everyone,</p>
