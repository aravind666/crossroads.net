<p><strong>Week 1: A Life of Adventure</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, June 14 </strong><br> Adventure</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes talking to God about whats been going on in your daily life.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, well be examining the question, Can a life of adventure coexist with a life of following Jesus?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For many of us, the idea of following Jesus may sound like the antithesis of a life of adventure. Christianity in practice has often been equated to following strict rules, playing it safe and staying comfortable. Yet when we look at scripture, we find example after example of people who embody adventure and excitement--along with a sold-out commitment to following Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write down every example you can remember of a Christian whose life looked less than "adventurous." Now write down every example of a Christ-follower whose life inspired you with action and adventure. Which list has more names? Ask God to strip away your preconceived notions, and invite his Spirit to lead you towards a renewed perspective on what life could look like following him.</p>
