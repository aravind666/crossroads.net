Don't miss our new message series, The Garden, beginning this weekend&#58;<br /><br /><img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/Garden_190x110.jpg\" alt=\"The Garden\" title=\"The Garden\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"10\" width=\"190\" height=\"110\" align=\"right\" /><em>Your life is a garden God has given you to cultivate. If you want the garden to produce fruit, you have to be intentional about tending it. Join us as we explore the fundamentals and disciplines of healthy growth.</em><br /><br />We're doing our best to alleviate the crunch between services and start on-time, so <strong>please do your best to arrive early and be in the auditorium before the service begins.</strong> Thanks!
