Thanksgiving Food Drive boxes for their families wrote to say thanks.
Here is a sampling of their notes&#58;<br /><br /><strong>Israel Baptist Church</strong><br /><em>&quot;Year after year, you continue to pour out your love upon those who truly need it, and we cannot thank you enough.&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>Body of Christ Deliverance Church</strong><br /><em>&quot;We thank God that you enabled our ministry to bless so many needy families.&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>Mission of Love</strong><br /><em>&quot;Thank you for all your help, that we can help other people in need...&quot;</em><br /><br />Thanks for giving generously to bless those in need in our community!
