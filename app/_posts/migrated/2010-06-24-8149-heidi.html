<p><strong>Thursday, June 24 </strong><br> Heidi</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to reveal his adventure to you and to fill you with boldness.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=John%2014:11-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 14:11-13</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>From the biblical accounts of David and Paul to men like George Mueller who died 100 years ago, a life of adventure seems possible. But what about today?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Jesus power, heres a snapshot: He did many unbelievable things, from healing the deaf to bringing his friend back to life. And John chapter 14 reveals Jesus telling his followers (us), that well do even greater things than him. If you think that sounds impossible, read about Heidi Baker, and you may change your mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Baker lives in Mozambique, the poorest country in the world. She and her husband care for thousands of orphans and they share the message of Jesus across that barren country. In order to demonstrate how much God loves the people of Mozambique, when Baker goes into a village, she requests to see the people who are deaf and blind. When someone comes forward, Baker prays for them and they are completely healed. Then she shares Gods love for all the people in the village, and hundreds accept and believe the message of Jesus on the spot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no greater adventure than a life spent passionately pursuing Jesus.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>When you hear about someone like Heidi, whats your immediate reaction? Do you dismiss a story like hers as impossible in todays culture? Or do you hear, "You could never do something like that?" The enemy has good reason to whisper those lies (and many others) when confronted with the awe-inspiring adventure that awaits the followers of Jesus. Write down every thought that stands in opposition to you receiving and displaying the power of Jesus in your own life, and then ask God to remove those thoughts and fears that would keep you from pursuing the adventure he has prepared for you.</p>
