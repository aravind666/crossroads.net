<p class="noPspace">Namaste,</p>
<p class="noPspace">All is Strong in Mumbai. We arrived late Friday night. All luggage made it safe and sound, and we were miraculously waved through immigration and customs while non-Crossroads folks waited in long lines. We were greeted by 5 of the Crossover staff, our hands and feet on the ground in Mumbai. Their warm faces made arriving more like coming home, and they had organized everything down to sweet Indian snack laden gift bags at the hotel. All slept well after arriving back to the hotel at 2am, but only after being greeted with pungent smells, loud honking, crowds of people everywhere, and large floral neck wreaths at the hotel. We had just arrived and India had already filled all of our senses.</p>
<p class="noPspace">Day one was a day of shopping and sight seeing, and many yawns as we adjusted to the 9 1/2 hour time difference. The gateway of India and St. Thomas Cathedral were welcoming, and wiith Crossover staff with us in the market none of us paid a tourist price.<br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Day 2 was an early start with breakfast , worship, and prayer, all before leaving to attend church. Christy said it best that when she pictured Indian church it never occured to her what that would look like. We arrived on a side street and entered an unmarked six story building, walked the stairs to the fourth floor and entered a small room with 40 chairs facing a small podium, keyboard and screen. The worship began and the forty sounded like hundreds. We worshiped with vigor with our brothers and sisters in Mumbai, and were energized by a sermon on the power of prayer. In a place where persecution as a Christian is assumed and only 1% of the population are Christians worship is a celebration and prayer is not a luxury but deeply depended upon.</p>
<p class="noPspace">We returned to the hotel to meet with the Crossover staff to brief about going to the aftercare home. The truth is nothing can really prepare you fully for this experience, but having Crossover train us gives freedom.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We arose early again today (day 3) and began our day with breakfast followed with a powerful time of worship lead by Cameron and Christine and Christy, and deep connective prayer, a great way to start a big day. We traveled to a home where 114 girls stay, the largest I have seen. There were 5 floors and no room was large enough for all of the girls. We did a music session upstairs with Cameron, Christine, Christy, and Victoria (who ended up teaching the girls the electric slide). Christine Falter was so excited about hearing the girls say "He makes beautiful things" after they taught them this song. On another floor Christine Wilson, Demian, and Carrie led a teaching on drawing the face, while the girls tried out their new art skills with charcoals. The drawings were almost as beautiful as the chai colored faces that filled the room. We joined them for a special lunch that the girls had prepared. It was almost too spicy for everyone but Carrie and Demian, and the Crossover aftercare director said that eating on the floor with the girls communicated as much as any activity with them. One girl shared during lunch that the home had been good to her, but that she had been there a long time. Soon she wanted to move out, get a good job, and pay her own bills. "Then" she said "I want to kick the mens asses." After lunch we switched floors and redid the activities with the other half of the girls. The rowdier girls were on the fourth floor while quieter girls, mainly girls with children or who were pregnant filled the third floor. When the fourth floor did music it was so loud, and the children fell asleep to the lull of the music. Every person found girls that they connected with, and the time was filled with joy. It was soon followed by time to leave, and tears in the vans on our way out. Our time here is filled with wild swings of joy and sadness, and tonight was no different. After a difficult time leaving and exhaustion setting in, we set out in the heavy traffic of Divali, the Indian holiday we are here during, for Sheesha. Sheesha is a rooftop restaurant with wonderful Indian dishes and kabobs, and a fantastic view of the fireworks of the evenings celebration of Divali. It was a strangely mesmerizing evening. We huddled tonight after dinner, almost too tired to sit up straight, and went over final details of the IJM retreat we will begin to lead tomorrow. Pray we lead strong, so that IJM staff may stay strong.</p>
