<p class="noPspace"><strong>Gods Faithfulness</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">For the past few weeks, weve been studying the force of money, and its effects on our relationship with God. Struggles with money often come down to struggles with security. So this week, well be looking at Gods faithfulness, and what it means to put our faith and trust in him fully.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%206:5-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">Exodus 6:5-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>One of the Bibles greatest examples of faithfulness is Gods deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt (the whole story can be found in Exodus 1-17). Its not only a story of Gods faithfulness, but also of the Israelites continued struggle to put their trust and faith in God.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Some things never change. Think about areas in your life where you recognize how God has shown up, and also the areas that you struggle to lean into him fully. Then pray that God will reveal his faithfulness to you (use the prayer below or pray your own). </p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>God, I want to rely on your faithfulness every day. Please give me the daily strength and faith to fully trust in you, and forgive me for the times that I havent. Amen.</em></p>
