<p class="noPspace"><strong>Community: Gifts</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue today looking at another section of Romans 12 to understand Gods view on community.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:6-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God has planted gifts in you. Truly, who you are is Gods gift to you. He made you with intrinsic value, in His image. What you do with the gifts He has given you is your gift or offering up to God and out to your community.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Two other places where gifts are listed is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:7-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 12</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 4</a>. You probably have more than one of these gifts, but choose right now one that you know or think you might have. Then decide one small humble way you can boldly use that gift and do it.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">John 13</a></p>
