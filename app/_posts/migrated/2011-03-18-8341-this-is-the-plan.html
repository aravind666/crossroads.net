<p><em>This</em> is the Plan?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for letting me play a part in your plan to restore the world.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Acts 1:1-11" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:1-11&amp;version=NIV">Acts 1:1-11</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>So if you were going to start a movement to radically change peoples lives and alter the course of human history, how would you do it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us would probably start by recruiting the most talented, experienced, well-connected leaders available. Then maybe have a fundraising campaign, set up the org chart, write the business plan, launch the marketing campaign, engage worldwide media channels, and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus took 12 uneducated nobodies, hung out with them for three years, and then set them loose. No funding, no marketing, no business development plan. More importantly, there was no Plan B. It was, is, and always will be in the hands of people like Peter, and James, and you and me.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about the idea that God doesnt have a Plan B? </li>
<li>How have you experienced this plan in action?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Gods plan doesnt rely on a particular leader or favorable markets. It relies on individual people connecting with others and showing them what a life with God is about. Take a few minutes today to think through who God may be wanting you to connect with.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway Hebrews 1" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 1</a></p>

<p><strong>Week 4 Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Among other things, the life of Jesus shows in practical terms how much he values individual people.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you struggle to believe that God loves you enough to die for you? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you struggle to believe that God loves others enough to die for them? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout this four-week journey, we have seen over and over how Jesus doesnt do things the way we would expect. As a result, his plan for how to grow this movement after he left shouldnt really be all that surprising.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about his plan? Why do you think he chose to do it this way?</li>
<li>How is God challenging you to take part in how Hes changing the world?</li>
</ul>
