<p class=\"noPspace\"><strong>The Vine&#58; Remain</strong></p>

The Daily goes to the vineyard this week. Anything that grows knows seasons, and we&rsquo;ll look at the rhythms of life that Jesus teaches through the vine. Since this was an intimate teaching with his disciples we&rsquo;ll look at it in the conversational style of The Message.

<strong>REFLECT</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A good wine even today, unlike other, more industrially-farmed produce, starts with a vine dresser or vigneron who truly cultivates the vines. Cultivating involves pruning, and pruning a vine well means cutting back up to 98% of the previous year&rsquo;s growth. This is why you see vineyards with poles, trellises and other ways of securing young vines because they are always so new. To spot what will soon be good wine grapes you have to look at the width of the mature stump and the root base beneath the surface. If a vine goes unpruned, it will eventually grow a thick vine that flowers, but never bears fruit.

<strong>RESPOND</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Close your eyes for a moment, and let the Gardner remind you that he is good. Then ask him to show you how he is pruning and cultivating you.
