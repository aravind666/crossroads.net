Crossroads volunteers picked up 5000-yes, 5000-boxes for this year's Thanksgiving Food Drive. In doing so, they've enabled other churches and charities to provide 66,000 meals both in Cincinnati and Mamelodi. That's a lot of cranberry sauce!<br /><img src="../images/uploadedImages/Corporate Blogger/tfd.jpg" alt="Thanksgiving Food Drive" title="Thanksgiving Food Drive" width="250" height="166" align="bottom" />
