<p class="noPspace">The Kennedy Connector, which&nbsp;will give Ridge and Madison better&nbsp;access from I-71, is under way.&nbsp;The city is working with us to&nbsp;minimize our impact, and we are&nbsp;working hard to adapt traffic flow.&nbsp;What to know:</p>
<p class="noPspace">1. There is limited access on&nbsp;both sections of Ibsen Avenue&nbsp;(and sometimes it is closed).</p>
<p class="noPspace">2. Allow yourself a few extra&nbsp;minutes before and after services.</p>
<p class="noPspace">3. Consider parking at the&nbsp;Annex&mdash;you can avoid Ibsen&nbsp;altogether.</p>
