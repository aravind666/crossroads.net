<p>The Invitation of Peace</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Ask God to reveal his peace in ways youve never known.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1108924140434&amp;s=0&amp;e=0010rdAeSxDY5XuPM8Tb8yI2zt2QkZqWWtRzKngxchCCx1k9BvRcP9GLcA_UovkCSw3K37nYPZ7HjfamznEyh9x9V94lExNn-XX07FDmxsgdqTZHO5hUXSlq8l-lrKfijPnEDnLNq__8KSRTtVtmRX5CzD6PsLN9s5sK50wEsOJB9fOAu7h3tC0CXVhq1B2x7-WyLxA5tsl0Efd5ivZv1rwSkMrqEgIBVNp" target="_blank">Luke 2:34-35</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>In  this part of Luke 2, Simeon holds baby Jesus and tells Mary that things  are about to get ugly. His description sounds less like a day spa and a  lot more like Jesus is going to wield some incredible power and disrupt  a thing or two.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Years  after Simeons prophesy, Jesus says to his close band of followers: "I  have told you these things so that you may have peace. In this world you  will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world" (John  16:33). In these words, we see the kind of peace Jesus brings. It isnt  the tranquil and calm state we often associate with peace, and it isnt  the avoidance of problems. Peace comes as we flourish in the midst of  our trouble, because of our relationship with Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have  you ever cut anything out of your life, and although it may have been  hard or painful, you can now see the relief and freedom it brought you?  Thank God for the peace he gave you. </p>
<p></p>
