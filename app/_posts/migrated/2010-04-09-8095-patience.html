<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>Friday, April 9<br></strong>Patience<strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><em><br>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em></p>

<p class="NormalWeb1"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2012:9-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 12:9-19</a><strong></strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">We never want to, but we all eventually mess up. When we do, we desire others, especially God, to be patient with usto show us some grace, give us the benefit of the doubt. But do we do the same for the people who offend us?</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Patience is a two-way street, and God clearly demands reciprocity. He expects us to pay it forward: to pass his patience and grace onto others. Yet, this doesnt just affect the recipient. When you release anger, annoyance, impatience and judgmentthe Spirit does its freedom work in you.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb1"><strong><br><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="NormalWeb1">Is there an area in your life where you would describe your current state as long-suffering? Ask God to help you experience joy through your patience.</p>
