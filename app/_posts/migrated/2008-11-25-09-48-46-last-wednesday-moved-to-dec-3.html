On the last Wednesday of every month, we gather for an evening of
worship and communion. But since many of us will be traveling to see
family,&nbsp; enjoying a night on the town or defrosting our turkeys
tomorrow evening, we've moved Last Wednesday to<strong> December 3 at 7pm</strong> in the Auditorium at Crossroads Oakley. See you then.
