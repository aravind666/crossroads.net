<p><strong>Week 1: Community</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, January 24</strong></p>
<p>Community Defined</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Acts 4:32" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%204:32&amp;version=NIV">Acts 4:32</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its the start of 2011, and often the new year comes with resolutions concerning change and growth. But what if, instead of resolving to change something about ourselves, we decided to submit who we are to our friends (the community of people around us), and allow them to speak into our lives about our strengths and foibles, and to love us into looking more like Jesus?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the next two weeks well take a look at a biblical case for community (friendship), and how the community around us will have a profound effect on our understanding of who God is, and who we are. While many of us have folks wed call friends, perhaps our definition of community isnt quite what God had in mind when he called us into relationship with one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Community means your lives are intertwined. Theres someone who knows who you are, and who cares enough about you to challenge you, to encourage you, to celebrate your success and mourn when youre in pain. And in the context of following Jesus, your community is there to speak into your life, pointing out what doesnt look like him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Define friendship in your own words. Did you write down any specific traits of a good friend? Consider why you wrote those particular traits, and identify whether or not the people you most closely associate with reflect those traits. Ask God to open your heart to new ways of experiencing friendship with others, and expanding your idea of friendship with him.</p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
