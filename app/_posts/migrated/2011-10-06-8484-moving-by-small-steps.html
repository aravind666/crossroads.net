<p>Moving by Small Steps</p>

<p><em>Ask God to help you step out and trust him today.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>In  1834, a 28-year-old pastor in Bristol, England founded an organization  called the "Scripture Knowledge Institute" to train and support  missionaries, distribute Bibles, and feed, house, and "scripturally  educate" orphan children. Over the next 68 years, George Mueller would  build five large orphan houses and care for over 10,000 orphans...all  while pastoring a church and preaching three times a week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Heres  the crazy part of this whole story: over 68 years and 10,000 orphans,  but not once did he ask for financial support. There was no government  aid, no commercial appeals, no fundraising plan. Whenever they needed  something-food, money, clothes, whatever it was-he prayed for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>That  story is very cool, but it can also sound very intimidating. Yet the  thing we need to realize is the same thing that George Mueller learned  early on. The kind of life we have been talking about these past few  weeks-this radical movement into trusting God-doesnt come in a huge  event. It is a long series of small choices made each day.  These small choices increase our capacity (faith) to follow Gods voice  and move in his direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Take a few minutes and ask God what ONE way he wants you to trust him today. Then move.</p>
