<p class="noPspace"><strong>Discern: Love</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We finish out our week on discerning the aroma and personality of Gods voice.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:2-7&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 13:2-7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Of all of the verses weve studied this week, todays is the most clear. When the Spirit is whispering to you, our first concern should not be gaining super spiritual gifts or being spiritual supermen and superwomen, but love. When it describes what love looks like in action, this should line up with all nudging and prompting we are receiving from the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">When you read 1 Corinthians, you might have thought of a wedding or funeral that you have attended, but this verse has daily application. Read the descriptions of love in verses 4 through 7, and pick the description that stands out to you. Practice it today, and make it your focus.</p>
