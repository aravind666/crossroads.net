<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>A good father loves his children. He desires to tell them who he is, who they are and what is best for them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More than 1,000 years before the birth of Jesus, God told his childrenagain and againof his love for them. They had a choice to live a blessed life. But His children, distracted and wandering, rejected him. They made destructive choices and felt the intense pain of separation from their Father. But the birth of Jesus is our Fathers choice to fulfill his promise of our deliverance. We, too, have a choice.</p>

<p><strong>RESPOND</strong> <br>Ask God to reveal to you how you choose life or death, blessings or curses, in your daily routine and thoughts. Where do you choose life? Where death? What changes could you make?</p>
