<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Pursues a Pure Life</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The New Man makes tough choices and takes a minority position. This week, The Daily will focus on what God says to men about living and working in the minority.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you pursue a holy and pure life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A14-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Peter 1:14-16</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Turn on the TV, open a magazine or listen to the radio and you might hear a story that speaks about men and their sexual conquests. But God asks us to take a minority position and pursue a life of holiness and purity. When we do, our relationships---single, dating or married---will be different and even more intimate. This doesnt mean we condemn ourselves or each other for our impure thoughts or actions, but to ask God what he wants to tell us about them. Then, we can to decide to pursue what He says.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What does God want to say to you about purity? Spend some time talking with him about what it looks like in your own life. Dont worry about whats on your heart. God is ready for it when you are.</p>
