<p>Work Builds the Kingdom</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me to see the meaning you put into work.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%203:%207-13&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">2 Thessalonians 3: 7-13</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its tough to talk to someone about God if youre just mooching off of them. Being idle leads to disruption, but when we work, we build relationships. Its no surprise then that Jesus worked as a carpenter, many of his disciples were fishermen, and Paul, who wrote many of the books of the New Testament, worked even as he traveled the world sharing the story of Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All of them could have demanded money for their services of teaching, but instead they exemplified obedience to God and heeded his direction to work. When we work, others see that were not just talk. They see that theres something different about us, and that invites a conversation about the Kingdom in a way no other method can duplicate.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Working for others isnt always something that comes easily. In the next week, ask God to show you opportunities to work. Perhaps its helping a neighbor carry in groceries, or stepping up for that extra project at work. Or, maybe for the first time in a long time, you just simply do your absolute best on the work you already do everyday. Whatever it is, embrace it as a declaration to God that youre willing to do any work he lays before you.</p>
