<a href=\"../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=549\"><img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/stafftraining.jpg\" alt=\"Staff Training\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" align=\"right\" /></a>As many of us heard this weekend, Brian Wells has announced that he will be leaving Crossroads' staff. (He will be staying on as a member of the Board of Spiritual Directors and will still be actively involved at Crossroads.) For those who want to hear more about Brian's future plans, we recently <a href=\"../../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=549\">posted a video</a> from our 2/13 meeting where Brian made his announcement to staff (**If you're having difficulty watching the video, it's likely due to high traffic. If this is the case, please try again later.)<br /><br /><strong>If you have any thoughts or questions, we've also <a href=\"../forum/viewtopic.php?t=153\">created a forum</a> for discussing them. Brian will be answering as many questions as he can there.</strong>
