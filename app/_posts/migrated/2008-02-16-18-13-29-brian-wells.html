(He will be staying on as a member of the Board of Spiritual Directors and will still be actively involved at Crossroads.) For those who want to hear more about Brian's future plans, we recently <a href="/messages/2008-06-21-week-three.html">posted a video</a> from our 2/13 meeting where Brian made his announcement to staff (**If you're having difficulty watching the video, it's likely due to high traffic. If this is the case, please try again later.)<br><br><strong>If you have any thoughts or questions, we've also <a href="/messages/2008-06-21-week-three.html">created a forum</a> for discussing them. Brian will be answering as many questions as he can there.</strong> </body></html>
