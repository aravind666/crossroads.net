<p><strong>Week 2: Community</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, January 31</strong></p>
<p>Fun Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Acts 2:46-47" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:46-47&amp;version=NIV">Acts 2:46-47</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>How many times have you left a party and thought, That wasnt fun. Thats not the sort of reaction we want after a night of revelry. So why should the idea of deep, rich community not also embrace having fun?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A community thats functioning well loves to have fun together. The early church was described as meeting together daily, sharing everything they had, and eating together with glad and sincere hearts. The picture that paints just sounds fun, and its a beautiful reminder for those of us who follow Christ to celebrate together with happy hearts and thank him for all hes done for us, and through us. So plan a party, make some dinner, or grab a cup of coffee with friends. And with glad and sincere hearts, have fun!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Not one for fun? Thats not OK. At some point today, call a friend or two (or ten) and get something on the calendar. It doesnt have to be expensive or extravagant, but be an initiator of fun, and celebrate with people you love. Nothing to celebrate? Make it up. The sun rose today, youve got fresh water to drink, the Bengals...never mind. Youll think of something. Have fun with people you love, and watch your community come alive.</p>
