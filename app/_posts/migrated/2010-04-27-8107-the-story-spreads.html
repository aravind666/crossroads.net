<p>The Story Spreads</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:42-47&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:42-47</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>The book of Acts reveals how the good news of Jesus spread. Its the story of the beginning of the churchGods new way of conveying to the world his character. Acts depicts an exciting community that was rapidly growing. The believers lived in the favor of God and man, and when you read this passage in Acts, you can see why. It was a community of people dining together, talking together, sharing their lives and learning from the apostles (Jesus twelve closest friends).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Acts also starts with the coming of the Holy Spirit. While in the Old Testament God spoke through individuals to his larger community, and then Jesus lived on earth for 33 years, from Acts until the present day were living in an incredibly exciting time: we all have direct access to God through his Spirit that lives in each of us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Invite someone to dinner this week. Set aside time to experience God in community on purpose this week.</p>
