<p><strong>Week 1: Faithfulness</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, August 16</strong></p>
<p>What is Faithfulness?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Today, ask God to reveal his faithfulness in your life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2054:10-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 54:10-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>For the next couple of weeks, we are going to be talking about faithfulness, first from God, and then from people. Seems simple enough, but maybe we should start at the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what is faithfulness anyway? The dictionary calls it the characteristic or quality of being faithful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>OK, not very helpful. So what is faithful then?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In its simplest form, faithful is reliable or true to ones promises. If someone is faithful, they can be trusted to keep their word.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the essence of faithfulness when it comes to Godthat he is who he claims to be, and that he will keep his promises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a hard time believing that God will keep his promises? Why or why not?</li>
<li>In what ways are you a faithful person?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Read back through the passage for today one more time. These are promises that God makes to his people. Spend a few minutes asking Him what promises he has for you.</p>
<p></p>
