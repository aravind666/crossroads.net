<p></p>
<p><em>God, allow me to hear your voice today.</em> <br><br><strong>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=ya4txrbab&amp;et=1104132326692&amp;s=0&amp;e=0011bYXBJkniSu-ZTCuhL_gTTN9nvUyMw06YApny3qThk3WfC07hNC1941sqLpmJp-xw1DHTIGJuRBXKsDYJ1-gNy3yxJhUeAv7AG-7_IPBBYr6VFyDj12E3hxzQo-ciCk3z_smWv69MtqkBIdpLKKjg3P9LwNsym61SqEEtYtklStfWslOgitxsIwQFZGJVZ0H09xSVdvDBqqkrjrEu9JJtIh4xY8hu4q_" target="_blank">Proverbs 11:28</a> <br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>It  seems like Solomons editor might have missed this one, right? After  all, most of us can think of people whose trust seems to be in their  money, yet it doesnt appear like theyve suffered or "fallen." But  certainly, none of us know the full details of anothers life (even if  were related). And none of us can see where each persons path is  leading. Better, of course, to bank on Gods wisdom that relying on  money for security will ultimately disappoint. But trust in Him for  security, and we will be supported with everything we need. <br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong> <br>In  the midst of the frustrations of daily life, it can be difficult to  feel like were "flourishing like leaves in spring." Grab a sheet of  paper, and jot down a quick list of ways that God has blessed or  provided for you in the last month.</p>
