<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodnews: Restraint</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue this week to look at how Jesus interacts with us in our brokenness through a story found in John. Focus today on the added verses 7-8.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:2-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">John 8:2-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The word Gospel means good news. Jesus doesnt just teach good news, he is the walking, breathing good news. There are two camps of condemnation that Jesus could fall into here--he could condemn the woman, or he could condemn the religious. He starts by lowering himself in stature. He doesnt speak, he simply scribbles in the sand. The most powerful intelligent man in the universe, God in the flesh, shows restraint. The good news is that the only man there with no sin, who might really have the authority to condemn, chooses another path.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Take a moment to remember and imagine what it means that Jesus is holy, without sin, set apart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%208&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 8</a></p>
