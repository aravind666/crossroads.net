<p>The Meaning of Immanuel</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%207:14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 7:14</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%208:9-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">8:9-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Come, O Come Immanuel and ransom captive Israel. These words from a Christmas carol proclaim a human yearning to be delivered from this world. The song quotes the prophet Isaiah who calls the one who will come Immanuel, meaning God with us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God yearns to be with his children to speak words of life that they would hear and choose to follow. But whether in the Garden of Eden or while ignoring prophets, His children continued to reject him and wander into slavery. What more could a father do? He could choose to become one of his own children, to be with them even more personally, even as a child, to show them the way to freedom. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong><br> Ask God to help you experience him every new moment of this day. Then look back at the end of today and consider how God was with you. Where did He rescue you?</p>
