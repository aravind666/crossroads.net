<p><strong>Week Four: The Life of Jesus</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, March 14</strong></p>
<p>Not the Way</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me to have your kindness and patience for those who dont like me.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="bible gateway Matthew 26:47-56" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:47-56&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 26:47-56</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>It almost feels like TV crime drama. Theres the inside guy whos setting up the head guy to be arrested. Hes going to come in, give the signal, and then the SWAT team will bust in and grab everybody. The first part, here, goes according to plan. Judas gives the signal, the troops rush in, and one of Jesus disciples slices off a bad guys ear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But heres where it gets odd: Jesus puts a stop to the whole operation. He heals the opponents ear. No rage, no retribution, just pure kindness in the midst of what He knows will lead to his pain, suffering and death. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>How would you have reacted if you were one of the disciples? Can you relate to a time like this?</li>
<li>How would you have felt if you were one of the soldiers part of this strange scene? </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of what else is happening, Jesus is always keenly aware of opportunities to impact the lives of people around him. For the man whose ear was healed, God had impacted his life in a radical, unforgettable way. Take a few minutes and ask God if there are people that he wants to impact through you today.</p>
