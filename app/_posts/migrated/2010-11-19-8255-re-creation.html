<p>Re-Creation</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to keep your eyes open to the bigger story hes unfolding in the world.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Isaiah%2065:17-25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Isaiah 65:17-25</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God spoke words through his prophet Isaiah that had a meaning greater than the story of the nation of Israel. The grand sweeping story of God is all about re-creation. That means that right now, God is creating a new world right in the midst of this one, and that hes inviting everyone to be part of it. Anytime we get to engage in things like seeking justice, serving the poor, or loving our next-door neighbors, were participating in the bigger story of Gods re-creation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Celebrate the ways you get to participate in Gods unfolding story in the world. It may help to list them out.</p>
