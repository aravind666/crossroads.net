<p>Singing Worship</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%20100&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 100</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAKE ACTION</strong></p>
<p>While weve established that singing is not the sole expression of worship, singing songs to God is a fantastic way to worship him. When we sing, were essentially putting our prayers to music, and expressing the desires of our heart towards God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So today youll need to find a spot where you can belt it out. Yeah, were singing out loud, and its going to be awesome. Whether you have speakers in your house or you want to plug in some headphones, load up a song that expresses your current attitude towards God. Dont have one? No sweat, just go to the <a href="/media/music/">music downloads on our website</a> and download songs for free. If its an unfamiliar song, go ahead and listen to it a few times. When youre ready, join in. Dont worry if youre not a singer. God created you (he knows), and what hes interested in is the tone of your heart, not the tone of your voice.</p>
