We're putting on an experiential, multi-sensory, self-guided Prayer Experience from Sunday, March 9 through Saturday, March 15 as part of the Consumed journey. We need lots of greeters to welcome people and get them started. Available shifts are listed below&#58;<br /><ul><li><strong>Monday</strong> (3/10)&#58; 7&#58;30-9&#58;30pm</li><li><strong>Tuesday</strong> (3/11)&#58; 3&#58;30-5&#58;30pm &amp; 7&#58;30-9&#58;30pm</li><li><strong>Wednesday</strong> (3/12)&#58; 7&#58;30-9&#58;30am; 9&#58;30-11&#58;30am; 7&#58;30-9&#58;30pm</li><li><strong>Friday</strong> (3/14)&#58; 1&#58;30-3&#58;30pm</li></ul>Greeters won't have to pray with anyone, and don't even need to believe in God. We just need welcoming folks who can give directions. Interested in helping? Please email <a href=\"mailto&#58;prayerexperience@crossroads.net\" title=\"Email Us\">prayerexperience@crossroads.net</a> and let us know&#58;<br /><ol><li>How many shifts you'd like to work,</li><li>Which shifts you're available, and</li><li>Your phone number</li></ol>We'll follow up to let you know for which shift(s) you're scheduled, and give you any final details. Thanks!
