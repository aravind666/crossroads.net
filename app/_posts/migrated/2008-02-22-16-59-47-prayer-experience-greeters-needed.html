<p>We're putting on an experiential, multi-sensory, self-guided Prayer Experience from Sunday, March 9 through Saturday, March 15 as part of the Consumed journey. We need lots of greeters to welcome people and get them started. Available shifts are listed below:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Monday</strong> (3/10): 7:30-9:30pm</li>
<li>
<strong>Tuesday</strong> (3/11): 3:30-5:30pm &amp; 7:30-9:30pm</li>
<li>
<strong>Wednesday</strong> (3/12): 7:30-9:30am; 9:30-11:30am; 7:30-9:30pm</li>
<li>
<strong>Friday</strong> (3/14): 1:30-3:30pm</li>
</ul>Greeters won't have to pray with anyone, and don't even need to believe in God. We just need welcoming folks who can give directions. Interested in helping? Please email <a href="" title="Email Us">prayerexperience@crossroads.net</a> and let us know:<br><ol>
<li>How many shifts you'd like to work,</li>
<li>Which shifts you're available, and</li>
<li>Your phone number</li>
</ol>We'll follow up to let you know for which shift(s) you're scheduled, and give you any final details. Thanks!</body></html>
