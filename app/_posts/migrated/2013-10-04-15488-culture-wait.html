<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>#Culture: Wait</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We have been looking at the story of Mary and Martha all week in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:38-42&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:38-42</a>. Today were reading a verse in Psalms that Mary herself could have written, and then well put ourselves in her shoes. #bigshoestofill</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20130:5-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 130:5-6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">A watchman keeps watch through the night and he knows that his long and difficult work is over when the sun rises. Our journey here on this earth will be filled with difficult moments, and our true hope should continue to be in the Kingdom come. Dont plant your hope here in this earth, but wait, like Mary, for the true hope that is in Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make yourself a watchman today, waiting and looking for God and his Kingdom throughout your day.</p>
