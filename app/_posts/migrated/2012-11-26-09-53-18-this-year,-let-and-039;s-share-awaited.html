<html><body><p class="noPspace">We created Awaited so that our unchurched friends could hear Godâ€™s story in a way that they could understand. So enjoy a show. Invite your friends. But take only what you need, so that we can share the Christmas story with as many people as possible. Shows run December 14-24 at Crossroads Oakley. Early tickets are available <a title="Awaited early tickets" href="/">here</a>.</p></body></html>
