our 2008 "all church journey" is now in week four. This past weekend, Brian Tome spoke with us about how God's Kingdom brings freedom and when we engage with a generous ethic, we not only find freedom for ourselves but we bring freedom to others as well.<br><br>As always, if you missed the service you can <a href="../my/media/playMedia.php&amp;idMedia=562">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="../../my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=563">watch it</a><a href="../../my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=563">.</a><a href="../../my/media/playVideo.php&amp;idMedia=563"> </a><br><br>If you didn't get one last weekend, you can also <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy../documents/Consumed_Guide.pdf">download the Consumed Guide</a> (as a PDF), and find a <a href="../consumed/groups_small_group_search.php">Consumed group</a>. (<em>Note: Study Notes will be suspended for the Consumed Journey because we're all working through the Consumed Guides.</em>)<br><br>Feel free to share any thoughts or reactions to the weekend in the comments.        </body></html>
