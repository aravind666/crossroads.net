<p>Walk it Out<strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ  </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:31%E2%80%9311:1&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 10:3111:1</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Paul, the writer of 1 Corinthians, ends todays passage with the words, Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. At first glance, it sounds like Paul might have an ego problem, right? Actually, hes modeling an important spiritual principle that the best way to point others to the Freedom Giver is to follow Jesus example ourselves. In fact, thats the litmus test on whether or not our example is worth being followed: Does our life line up with Jesus life and teaching? Its a big questionand its worth considering.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>1 Corinthians 10:31 says Whatever you do, do it all for the glory (honor) of God. Ask God to help you walk out your freedom in ways that honor him and serve as an example of Jesus for others.<br><br></p>
