<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to fast this week on rice and beans only while looking at different areas where we can transfer our investment. Today we assess our assets. (say that 10 times fast)</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:16-18&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Luke 8:16-18</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lets look today at decisions we make to invest ourself (our resources, talents, time) and decide are we investing into a liability or an asset. Choosing to do the beans and rice fast means that you are investing your will and physicality towards change that matters: change in you that is spiritual and eternal, and change in our world as we choose to give that money outside ourselves.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Food is funny, we buy it on credit card and pay interest on it long after it has gone down the toilet. This week we invest a little further out (than the sewer).</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Set an alarm and sit quietly for ten minutes. Start with this simple prayer: God, help me to be more like Jesus who invested his whole self. Make me an asset in your Kingdom, amen.</p>
