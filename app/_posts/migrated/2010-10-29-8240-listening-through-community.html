<p>Listening Through Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you hear his voice through the people in your life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RE-READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%203:7-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 3:7-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Eli was the one who helped Samuel recognize the voice of God in his life. We all need people who hear from God to help us discern when God is speaking to us. Do you have someone in your life who fits this description?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to help you identify the "Elis" in your life. Ask Him who you should reach out to for wisdom and encouragement regarding Game Change.</p>
