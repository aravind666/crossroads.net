<p>Using Our Talents to the Fullest</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, teach me about my gifts and talents. Help me to honor you by bringing my whole self to any and all work that I do.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025:%2014-28%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 25: 14-28</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God has given each of us things were good at doing. Perhaps your gifts include a knack for increasing the bottom line. Or leading people. Or attention to detail. Whatever the ability, God expects us to put our gifts to work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Work is meant to be a blessing, not a punishment. When we work, we get to see reflections of God in our labors. Creativity, ingenuity, patience, endurance, sacrifice and promises keptall things that are needed to do work. And, all things that are a part of Gods character.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God doesnt expect everyone to become the star athlete, the best cook, or a CEO. He just expects us to bring the fullness of who we are to whatever our work is in the moment, and not to bury the talents that He gives us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever considered yourself a resource created by God? Ask God to show you what talents you might be burying. Write them down. Maybe youre already using that gift, but not to its fullest potential. Or maybe youre using it for selfish ambition, rather than for Gods intention. Maybe youre not even aware you have that gift! Acknowledge and thank God for your gifts and talents. Then, try to use them this week as you do your work.</p>
