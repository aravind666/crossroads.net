<html><body><p>Last night at <strong>Last Wednesday</strong> we spent time praying for the upcoming year and for what we see God doing in our community. The leaders of various ministries at Crossroads wrote specific prayers for their ministries and we prayed them together. If you'd like to continue praying for what's going on around here, you can download a PDF containing the prayers we prayed last night:<br><br><a href="">Prayers </a>(PDF)</p></body></html>
