<p>The Monster in Our Path</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see where you can take action and experience the miraculous.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%2017:20-50&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 17:20-50</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes when were face-to-face with something that feels monstrous in our life (debt, marital problems, a lie we need to confess), we want to avoid it at all costseither hoping to avoid the pain or not believing we can get through it. But consider Davids method: 1) He heard the battle and ran towards it. 2) He acknowledged Gods incredible power. 3) He fought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>David wasnt ignoranthe knew he was dwarfed by Goliath, he knew it looked crazy to outsiders. But he knew he wasnt going to win the battle because of his own strength. He stepped toward the monster, knowing he was following Gods audacious call, and believing that God would honor his action.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And so David experienced the miraculous.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of something you are terrified to do: Maybe its a conversation. Maybe its a project for work. Maybe its finding a new job or opening up to your kids. Write down all the reasons that you think youre going to fail. Now write in big, bold letters over top of it God. Carry that paper with you to remind you that God is bigger than any reason (legitimate or otherwise) that you may have.</p>
