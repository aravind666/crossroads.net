<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Its fairly common for people to assume that following Jesus is going to be a "sell everything I have" and live in burlap. Even this parable that Jesus tells us in Matthew might seem that way at first glance. It is true that for some of us, Jesus will ask for this level of purging because he knows what we actually need and where were getting stuck. But the man in this parable doesnt wind up with empty pockets. His pockets are just perfected. He pours all of his resources into something with incredible value: the pearl. And the pearl comes with land. And joy.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We all have resources. We all have the chance to invest in pearls. Its the choosing of the pearls that matters. "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matthew 6:21).</p>

<p class="noPspace">So we have to decide: Where do we want our hearts?</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Think of a time when you invested in something that felt like a pearl--something that felt good to have your heart tied to.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">God, show me where you want my heart.</p>
