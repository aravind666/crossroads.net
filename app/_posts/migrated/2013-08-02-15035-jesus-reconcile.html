<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays focus is on verses 19-20, as we finish out our week looking at Christs identity in Colossians 1.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 1:15-20</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Relationships are built on trust. Throughout the history of Gods story with mankind, we have failed to trust him--beginning with the fall of man and woman in Genesis. We are self-focused and untrusting and that is to be at war with a relationship with God. God dwelled fully in Christ on earth just so he could pursue us, and his blood on the cross writes the peace treaty for all the ways that our relationship with God is broken.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
