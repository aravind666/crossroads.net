<p class="noPspace"><strong>Salt &amp; Light: Opening Up To Others</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were unpacking Jesus descriptions of his followers as salt and light.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>"Let me tell you why you are here. Youre here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? Youve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage. Heres another way to put it: Youre here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. Were going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you dont think Im going to hide you under a bucket, do you? Im putting you on a light stand. Now that Ive put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand--shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives.By opening up to others, youll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven."</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Matthew 5:13-16<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0015sGt7-ox0DRHDzQCo2091ZiqrbIYaQrqmzO3Hf1VjBPbBhzF7z74M5uQOnbQtk2pjVot86yA2Wt63El5Fo7Y7Di_7yW4HI9R_eZJ3mWiaMRawUxi4004XVP6L0MDEBsMe-mnicGCXGzLLGgISrJN3A==" target="_blank">(The Message)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Being salt and light--sharing the good news of Jesus in a fresh, personalized and life-guiding way--usually happens in the context of established relationships. Theres already trust and camaraderie. Theres already "permission" to be invested in each others life, whether its at the best friend level or the guy you talk to every week in the office.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Make a mental list of the relationships you have with people who arent followers of Jesus--or who have church exposure but still need the salt and light you have to offer. Then pray for times of good, honest conversation with those people.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Talk about your experience sharing the good news about Jesus. Is it a topic that comes up often in conversation, or not at all? Is it energizing, scary, exhausting?</li>
<li>Share at least one way you see Jesus moving in your life right now. If youre not sensing His presence in your life, share one way that youve felt his presence in the past.</li>
</ul>
