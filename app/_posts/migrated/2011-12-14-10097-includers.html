<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We  might not all go the Tim Tebow route and paint "John 3:16" on our face,  but we all have ways of spreading our excitement, even if theyre  subdued. Yesterday, we considered those ways; in other words, we  discovered our style of sharing what we love.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Consider  the shepherds response when Jesus was born. They werent forced into  anything. They didnt have a formula or try to mimic someone else.  Rather, they had an experience with Jesus that they wanted to pass onto  others. It wasnt just an abstract idea; it was a person they met and a  power they saw. </p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Have  you ever been in a situation where it felt completely natural to tell  someone about how Jesus is part of your life? Be open this week to more  of those situations. If this hasnt happened for you, dont feel guilty  (because that guilt wouldnt be coming from God). Just spend some time  praying for a friend. </p>
