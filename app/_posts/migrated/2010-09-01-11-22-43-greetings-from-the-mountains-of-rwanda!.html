<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">Greetings from the mountains of Rwanda! A team from both Crossroads and Charity &amp; Faith are here in the midst of a three-day visit.  </span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal"><br></span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">Sixteen years ago, Rwanda was ground zero for evil in the world, when over just a few months almost 1 million people were slaughtered—that’s</span><span class="normal"> 1 in every 8 people!  It’s impossible to forget this as we drive around the city of Kigali and the village of Rwinkwavu, hearing stories of how neighbors killed their own neighbors and must now face each other’s families daily. </span></p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Remarkably, in the aftermath of that horror, there is great hope. We are visiting a provider of that hope called <a title="Partners in Health" href="/">Partners in Health.</a> PIH is the best organization in the world at caring for those living in extreme poverty. Seriously, their record for caring for people with HIV or tuberculosis can only be matched by God himself. PIH is graciously hosting us at their main site so we can learn how they do things and hopefully bring some of that knowledge back to Mamelodi. </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal"> If we can harness only a fraction of their mojo, people’s lives will most definitely change for the better in South Africa.    Today we heard how PIH does things from the key leaders here in Rwanda, and tomorrow we will be accompanying some of their community health workers to go into people’s homes and show them love. </span></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">Hopefully we’ll be able to post some pics and video once we return to the U.S.  </span></p>
