<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Carry On: Foot</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we finish out the series on Rhythms. Read Psalm 116, with a focus today on the foot.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20116:7-8&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Psalm 116:7-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Keeping rhythms, like agreeing to maintain a Sabbath, regular family or community meals, connecting with God or play is a commitment. You are going to stumble, make mistakes and learn what does and doesnt work for you. You will notice what distracts you and what woos you away. Take the time to notice, and then offer it up to God. Repent, which just means turn away from what doesnt work, and turn toward Gods goodness for you. Then ask God to protect your feet from stumbling.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Make a list of things that could rob your rhythms and commit them to God in prayer.</p>
