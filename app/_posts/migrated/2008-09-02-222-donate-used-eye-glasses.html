<div>The old eyeglasses collecting dust in your drawer at home could bring sight to a child or adult living in the slums surrounding Johannesburg, South Africa. Drop off your donated glasses at the Info Center this weekend or next weekend, and they'll be cleaned, measured for their prescriptions and taken to South Africa, where they'll be distributed via mobile eyeglass clinics. Reading glasses, often found at dollar stores, are also in high demand.</div>
