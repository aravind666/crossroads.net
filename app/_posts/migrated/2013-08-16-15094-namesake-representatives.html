<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Namesake: Representatives</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God is ______. Weve learned that there are many words that fill in the blank. This week well see how God points back to himself--hes a self-promoter. Well do that through five verses that say for his names sake.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2012:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 12:22</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you have repented and received Christ as the one who saves you and the one who is in charge of your life, then you are his people. You are a representative of His name--his namesake. And God is the answer to every problem, he is good, he is all that we need. If this is so, why wouldnt He want to promote himself among the people so that they will find the answer, the goodness and the source?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lectio Divina is a way of prayer that meditates on a passage of scripture. Today, just focus on for his names sake. You can say it repeatedly, putting the focus on different words as a kick start.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 10 </a></p>
