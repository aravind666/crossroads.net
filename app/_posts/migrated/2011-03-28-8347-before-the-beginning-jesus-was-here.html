<p><strong>Week 1: Before the Beginning</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Were taking a break from the current Daily study (The Good God of the Old Testament) to reflect for a week on what happened before the beginning. While Genesis 1 records the beginning of this created world, God existed before this event, and the Bible records several other things about God, Jesus and the world that likely pre-date Genesis. This week, as you look at these pre-Genesis passages in the Bible, allow them to open your hearts to the bigger picture of who God is and what he is doing in the world.</em></p>

<p><em>God, help me to see the timeless aspects of your character in scripture this week.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its hard for us to fathom life without the metric of time. What would it be like to live without this critical measure of the passing of days, seasons or NCAA tournament tip-off times?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet, before there was time, Jesus existed. He didnt just pop up in the New Testament periodhe is part of the eternal and outside-of-time Holy Trinity. In order to win our hearts, He took on the limitations of a human bodyincluding being subject to time. This is why John says, the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. This timeless God (Jesus) is willing to humble himself and experience life as we, too, live it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What does it say about the character of Jesus that he was willing to experience life in our shoes? Spend a few minutes sharing any thoughts that come to mind with Jesus through prayer.</p>
