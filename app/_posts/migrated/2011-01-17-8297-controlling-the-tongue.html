<p>Controlling the Tongue</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me see how the things I say are either wounding others or bringing them freedom.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%203:9-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 3:9-12</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me, might be the most used and least true saying in the U.S. The reality is that words do hurt. As James describes, they have the power of life and death. But for some reason, we usually have a hard time believing it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How many relationships have disintegrated because of hurtful words? How many people have been deeply discouraged because of a careless comment? Whether or not our words are justified is the wrong question. The question is whether or not our words bring life and freedom to those around us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>As you go through your day today, make a mental catalog of the things you say to those around you. How many of them are spoken out of lovethat is, for the good and benefit of the personand how many are said to satisfy your own dislikes, pet peeves or insecurities?</p>
