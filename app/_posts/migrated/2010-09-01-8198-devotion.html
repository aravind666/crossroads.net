<p>Devotion</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to speak to you about commitmentboth his and yours.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:42&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:42</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The word devoted means to give yourself over to a cause or activity, or to vow. Sounds like a marriage, doesnt it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If youre a commitment-phobe, thats quite alright. Its not that type of commitment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The early community of Christ-followers just gave themselves over to following the teachings of Jesus through his disciples. They also vowed to do life together: to be authentic with one another without pretense, to eat meals together, and to pray for (and with) one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They devoted themselves to these things together. And they didnt do it halfway; they were all in. Committed. Devoted.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What are you struggling with regarding commitment? Take a big step and share it with someone you trust, maybe over coffee or lunch. Then, talk to God about it together.</p>
<p></p>
