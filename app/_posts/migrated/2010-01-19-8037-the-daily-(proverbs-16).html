<p><strong>Tuesday, January 19</strong><br>Wisdom is a Choice<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Proverbs 16<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Within any relationship, how you really feel is better expressed by what you do each day for that person rather than by strategizing big surprises or gifts. <br><br>The same is true with wisdomit is less about the big decisions and more about the small choices of everyday life. This is exactly what Solomon describes here in a variety of contexts. Wisdom is an intentional, disciplined daily choice. We must choose to be wise; it doesnt happen naturally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the proverbs in this chapter connected with you the most? Why?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is one thing that you can do today to live more wisely?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>At its core, wisdom is about our connection with God, and one of the best ways that we can connect with God is by making his words part of our thought life. Spend a couple of minutes memorizing the proverb you connected with the most. Then ask God to help you remember it when you have an opportunity to make a wise choice.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Proverbs 2:1-5</p>
