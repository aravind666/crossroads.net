<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Last week, we read the entire book of James. This week, were focusing on one passage and going phrase by phrase.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 1:2-4</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Pure joy? In trials? Sounds like crazy talk. But we can take these trials as signs that 1) God cares enough about us to refine and shape us, and 2) we get to be part of his plan to redeem the world.</p>
