<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Give Your Very Best</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to follow the book of Acts and how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to reveal someone you can help.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+23%3A16-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 23:16-24</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Famous guys in the Bible like Paul often get a reputation for being big and tough. He looked like he had it all together especially because he was doing something big. But guys like Paul and the disciples needed help, too. Thats where his nephew and the commander came in. They knew he was in trouble and they gave their very best---all 200 soldiers, 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen (whoa)---to get Paul safely out of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Seek out someone to help and give them your very best. It could be someone you work with, someone in your family or someone you just met.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+23&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 23</a></p>
