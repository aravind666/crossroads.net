<em><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #292929">Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you<br>during this time</span></em>.<br><br><br><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana">READ</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>Ephesians 5:1-7</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana">REFLECT</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>At first glance, this section might look like yet another one of those lists of rules about behaviors that are so popular with religion. Its more of the, Do this, dont do that kind of thinking, right?<br><br>Look again. Its not that easy.<br><br>Paul starts the section off saying, Imitate God, because you are His much-loved children. Rather than doing the right thing out of guilt or obligation, he says that our obedience is an overflow of the love God fills us with. To use Pauls example from verse 4, we watch the way we talk not because were supposed to, but because Gods love is overflowing into our language and what we say to others. </span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana">It sounds counterintuitive, but following a list of
rules is really much easier than the nitty gritty of figuring out how to live
like Jesus, which should be the goal. In what ways are you tempted to live
based on rules rather than love?</span></li></ul>

<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">We will never break free of religionof living a life based on rules that attempt to earn Gods favoruntil we truly connect with the love that he has for us. Spend a few minutes writing down the ways God has poured out his love for you. When you are finished, read back over your thoughts, saying them as a prayer of gratitude to God.<br><br></span></p>
