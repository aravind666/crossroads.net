<div>Congrats to everyone who decided that they wanted to mark their faith in Jesus and make a public declaration by being baptized this weekend. Many of us decided &quot;in the moment&quot; that it was something we wanted to do.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">If you were one of these &quot;in the moment&quot; people, would you mind sharing a little about your experience this weekend and why you decided to be baptized?<br />&nbsp;<br /></span></div>
