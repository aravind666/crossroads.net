Take
a break from the heat with acoustic guitar duo Alex and Mia Carruthers.
The brother-sister pair will share original songs with jazz and blues
roots, all in the comfort of the air-conditioned Atrium. It's part of&nbsp; <a href="http://www.oakleynow.com/oakleyafterhours/" target="_blank" title="Oakley After Hours">Oakley After Hours,</a> so you can make a night of it in the neighborhood. Concert starts at <strong>7pm Friday, July 25.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>
