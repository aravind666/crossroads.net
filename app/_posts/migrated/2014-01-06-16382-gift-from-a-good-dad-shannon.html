<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>SHANNONS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God told me in a dream I would be moving to India. When I moved there to work with International Justice Mission, I still doubted He would use me to help bring freedom to girls forced in sexual slavery. What I didnt realize is he had already started using me the moment I said yes and obeyed.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">One day I went into the red light district and met a brothel owner. I was so mad when I met her. Thinking "How could she enslave young women and girls!" As soon as that thought came to mind, God spoke to me, saying "I love this woman as much as l love you Shannon." I knew we must pray for her after that. We sat on the floor of an old dirty building and prayed over her.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I dont know what she is doing or if she knows Jesus now, but I do know my obedience fostered freedom for this woman to be open and that room was filled with grace! God used me in ways I didnt even imagine.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, think of someone you dont normally pray for. Like a jerk, your second-cousin-once-removed or even yourself. Think about that unexpected person and pray for them. God has a good plan for them, too.</p>
