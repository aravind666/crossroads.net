<p>Sharing Life</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to ask God what it means to share your life with others.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Acts%202:46&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 2:46</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>To some, being a hermit sounds delightful. Introverted folks love solitude, and having some chatty Cathy talking their ear off is worse than sticking a pencil in ones eye. Solitude is good in some contexts, but even nonsocial introverts need people to grow, to survive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The early believers didnt seclude themselves or check out from everything that was going on around them. They had their authentic community with other Christ-followers, and they brought that same identity to the rest of their society. And the Bible says that they had glad and sincere hearts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How have different kinds of community affected you? How have you affected others in your community?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Share an aspect of your spiritual life with someone you trust. If you want to take it a step further, share another aspect of your life.</p>
