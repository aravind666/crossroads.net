<p class="noPspace"><strong>Salt &amp; Light: Light of the World</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were unpacking Jesus descriptions of his followers as salt and light.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.<strong>You are the light of the world.</strong>A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."</p>
