<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Rahab: The Red Cord</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue to look at the story of Rahab. Did you know that Jesus, who was not born for another 1400 years, showed up in the story of Rahab? Look for him in the reading today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%202:15-21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Joshua 2:15-21</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Israelites were delivered from Egypt through the blood of a lamb being rubbed on the door facing--the only thing that spared them from death and then delivered them from Egypt. This is a prophetic story of Christs blood on the cross being the only thing that separates us from death today. Jericho is about to be destroyed in battle by the Israelites through Gods power, but Rahab, based on her fear of God and loving-kindness, has offered her support to the Israelites. She will be spared through the red cord, another symbol of Christs blood, the blood of the lamb.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Tie a red yarn or make a red mark somewhere today so you can be reminded that God is the one who can spare you from death.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
