<p>During this past weekend’s <a href="/" target="_blank" title="Super Bowl (of Preaching) Video">Super Bowl (of Preaching) service</a>, Chuck, Brad, Brian and Jesus-Peter all encouraged us to be courageous about how we engage with the upcoming Reset journey (beginning Feb. 21). Here are three ways to follow through on their challenge courageously right now:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><a href="/" title="Sign Up to Host">Host a group</a>.</strong> We still need hosts, and we’ll give you everything you’ll need to facilitate a group for the Reset journey, including training (if you want it).</li>
<li>
<strong>Invite friends to participate.</strong> It can be a little intimidating to ask your friends, neighbors and co-workers to talk about Jesus for six weeks, but it might end up being the most important conversation you ever have with them. Once you've signed up to host, <a href="/" title="Invite A Friend">send your friends an email invitation</a> to get the ball rolling.</li>
<li>
<strong>Join a group.</strong> No one will make assumptions about what you believe, and we’ve got plenty of kind folks looking for people to join their groups. You can <a href="/" title="Find A Group">search for a group right now</a>.</li>
</ol>
