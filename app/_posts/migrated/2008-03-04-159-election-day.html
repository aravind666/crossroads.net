<html><body><p>It's Election Day, and six precincts are voting at Crossroads. It's awesome to see the people who are braving the 40-ish degrees and rain to come and vote, and once they are in the building we welcome them with a hot cup of free coffee. <br><br>I wish the people holding the signs outside would come in for some coffee (without their signs, of course). They look really wet. </p></body></html>
