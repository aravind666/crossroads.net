<p><strong>Tuesday, May 17 </strong><br>The Spirit of Goodness</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before reading the scripture today, spend a minute just being quiet and preparing to hear Gods voice.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%2015:14&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 15:14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God doesnt hold back on us. He doesnt say, "If you play by my rules, Ill take care of you." He loves us without hesitation, despite our imperfections. Thats the goodness and abundant generosity of God. And this part of His Spirit can overflow in us, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main thing that holds us back from reflecting Gods goodness and generosity isnt lack of caring. Its lack of experiencing and appreciating His goodness towards us. Until we fully receive the magnitude of His generosity, we cant reflect that to others or be "competent teachers" of His truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because of His goodness, we open up. We live generously. We set others free.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If you have a hard time reflecting goodness and generosity (with your finances, your time, your attitude), take some time today to reflect on the depth of Gods love for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2019&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 19</a></p>
