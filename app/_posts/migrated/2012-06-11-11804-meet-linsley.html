<p class="noPspace">Linsley Hartenstein showed recently that you can combine the things youre passionate about to have a positive impact on people, no matter your age.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Awhile back, the 16-year-old high school student entered a contest to get the Christian indie rock band Cloverton to play here in Cincinnati. I met the Cloverton guys at a camp I attended. They were super cool, Linsley says. A couple weeks after camp, the band posted a message on Facebook saying they were having a contest to bring the band to your hometown. One of my friends told me I should enter, so I did! Linsley recorded a video of herself singing one of their songs and posted it on YouTube. To her surprise, it was a winner. I was excited and humbled, Linsley remembers. I knew God could do some awesome things through this event.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Music is a big part of Linsleys life, but before the contest came along, Linsley had been praying and talking to her dad about something else close to her heart: the Game Change campaign. I felt called to do something. I told my Dad that if by any slim chance I won, I would ask the guys if they would be willing to make it a benefit concert, she says. So she did just that: on April 17 at The Underground, Linsley and her band The Emerson Project opened for Cloverton, enjoyed a rocker of a free concert and ended up raising $1,000 for Game Change. My friend and I had written a song for the benefit, Linsley recalls. We made this our last song and I explained what the song was about and a little bit of my heart for [India]. Concert attendees could then get their own CD of the tune for a donation of $5 or more. The donations rolled in, everyone had a great evening and more people were made aware of whats happening in India.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Where others might lament whats happening on the other side of the world and simply go enjoy a concert with friends, Linsley proved that the actions of one person really can affect the lives of many. God is definitely moving, and what He is doing through Game Change is going to change peoples lives, she explains, pointing to multi-site, South Africa and India as her motivators. I have been going to Crossroads Mason since it opened and have watched it grow and reach so many people, she explains. I went to Africa when I was 13, and seeing the need with my own eyes makes it very exciting to hear whats taking place in South Africa. With India, I think freedom, restoration and redemption for girls who are suffering is very parallel to our story. If God restores and redeems our brokenness, how can we not help them?</p>
