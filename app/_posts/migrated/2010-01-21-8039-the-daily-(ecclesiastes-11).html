<p><strong>Thursday, January 21</strong><br>The Reward<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Ecclesiastes 11<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Scientists have estimated that as many as 90% of the species on our planet remain unknown. Despite all our technology, we have no idea what mysteries our own solar system contains. In fact, we dont even know how our own brains work.<br><br>Long before humanity was admitting how little we know, Solomon was already there. He saw how limited our understanding is, and realized that part of wisdom is stepping back and enjoying the life that God has given us. Our stubbornness and pride can get in the way of it, but the decision to relax, trust God, and enjoy our lives is one of the wiser things we can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways do you have a hard time enjoying life? Why?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is one thing you can do today to enjoy your life?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>No matter what we go through, life itself is a gift from God. Take a few minutes to thank God for the life he has given you, and ask him to help you enjoy it in a new way today.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>Psalm 65</p>
