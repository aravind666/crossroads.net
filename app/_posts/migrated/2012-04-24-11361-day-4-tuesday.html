<p class="noPspace">Greetings from Mumbai!</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Its your intrepid band of explorers, back to the hotel at 11:47pm and facing a 6:45am curtain call in the morning. Tonight will be brief, but tomorrow will return with both guns blazing (and Brandon). Today was another first concerning our work in Mumbai, as we assisted Crossover in supporting one of their partners (Vision Rescue), who provides services to street children in and around Mumbai. With a city this size, its an all too familiar reality here to see young children on the streets, caring for and supporting even younger brothers and sisters. And kids who find themselves facing these circumstances are often easy targets for traffickers, looking to ensnare a young kid for an easy dollar (or rupee).</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">So today was straight out of a made for Mumbai movie, starring your very own motley crew of Americans, wrangling 100 Mumbai street kids. And it was full success, no matter who you asked. Between a giant parachute, Hindi kids worship songs, hopscotch, coloring, origami, and necklace stations (and one very sweaty jump rope station), the kids were kept busy, engaged, and smiling all day. There was quite a bit of talk involving the placement of extremely cute, extremely small children in various pieces of luggage, but due to my incredible leadership, we successfully avoided an international kidnapping incident. I know Don Gerred will be so proud of me.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Since its late (and the kids are super cute), weve attached some pics. I think they tell the story of the day better than I can.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Good night!</p>
