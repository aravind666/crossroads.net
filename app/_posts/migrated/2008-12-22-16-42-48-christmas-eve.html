Here are a few answers to common questions:<br><br><strong>Are tickets needed?</strong><br>No. This will be open seating.<br><br><strong>What time are the services?</strong><br>11am, 1pm, 3pm, but <em>arrive a little early to enjoy the atrium Christmas experience including free (of course) family portraits, hot chocolate, goodies and more.</em><br><br><strong>How long will services last?</strong><br>About an hour. Maybe less. Maybe more.<br><br><strong>Is it "kid friendly"?</strong><br>Oh yeah. Bring the whole family. (Even your weird uncle.) <em>Please note that there won't be childcare at Crossroads that day. </em>(For the record, there won't be "weird uncle" care either, so don't even think about it.)<br><br><strong>What will the service be like?</strong><br>We'll be walking through the Christmas story with music, images and storytelling. <br><br><strong>Is it really going to be 58 degrees on Christmas Eve?</strong><br>Derek said it would be like that, so yeah...I guess it probably will be.</body></html>
