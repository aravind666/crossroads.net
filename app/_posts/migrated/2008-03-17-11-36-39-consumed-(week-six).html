our 2008 &quot;all church journey&quot; is now in week six. This past weekend, Brian Tome spoke to us about how generous communities change the world. We were each challenged to live more generous lives and the &quot;mark the moment&quot; by tacking our commitment to the big screen. It was a very cool and significant moment for our community.<br /><br />As always, if you missed the service you can <a href="../my/media/playMedia.php&amp;idMedia=567">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="../../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=566">watch it</a><a href="../../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=566">.</a><a href="../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=564"> </a>
