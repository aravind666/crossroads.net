<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Receives Feedback</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about how men play on a team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you receive feedback.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 27:17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Iron sharpens iron can sound a little harsh, but it means we need our team to tell us the truth. The truth can be good stuff we need to hear (like a compliment) or stuff thats not so good, but we need to hear it. Like any team, players only do better when they are able to recognize what theyre good at and how they can be better. When the truth comes from someone we trust, we have to remember that its being given to help and strengthen not only us, but the team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, receive feedback no matter how its being given.</p>
