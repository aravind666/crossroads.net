<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">The hyper-religious Pharisees taught that imperfections like disease and physical challenges were the repercussions of sin, either within the individual or the family. Jesus teaching on this is all new. He sees possibility in our brokenness; its a possibility for God to engage and shine light. The night/day reference in verse four is a metaphor for life/death, and worthy of noting that he sayswein this verse.Weare called to join Jesus in Gods work.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
