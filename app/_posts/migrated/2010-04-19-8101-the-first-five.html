<p>The First Five</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to quiet your mind and help you focus on him. </em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%201:1-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 1:1-31</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT </strong></p>
<p>Do you want to know Godto really know his character? Understanding God is easier when we start with understanding his story as told in the pages of scripture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the next two weeks The Daily will survey collections of books in the Bible, and stop along the way to focus on how this truth intersects our life and relationship with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well start this week with the Old Testament, which is Gods story in all years ending in B.C. It begins with five books, also called the Pentateuch, the Torah or the Books of the Law.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Genesis and Exodus capture the beginning of Gods story and his connection to his people, the Israelites (or Hebrew) nation. These books include big stories like Adam, Abraham, and Moses, who led the Israelites out of bondage and into a promised land. Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy are books that teach Gods way of life to his first people.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Were created in the image of God. What does this say about the relationship God desires to have with you?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Genesis%201:1-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis chapter 1</a> again, picturing God as an artist.</p>
