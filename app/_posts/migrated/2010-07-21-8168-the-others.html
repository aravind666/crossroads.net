<p>The Others</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment to pray that God fills your heart today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2018:21-22&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 18:21-22</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Once our eyes have been opened to see the enormity of our offense against God, the injuries which others have done to us appear by comparison extremely trifling. If, on the other hand, we have an exaggerated view of the offenses of others, it proves that we have minimized our own. (The Message of the Sermon on the Mount, John Stott)</p>
<p></p>
<p>God has perfect grace toward you. We have imperfect grace toward others. Forgiving others is gratitude for the perfect grace that we have been given.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Forgive again, today, those who you forgave yesterday. Repeat tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask for the Spirits help in erasing the debts of others in your life.</p>
