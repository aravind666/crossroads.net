<p>Trust Demolishes Fear</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, build my confidence in the promises youve made to me, and in the unconditional love you have for me.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Living with peace doesnt mean were passive or detached from whats happening around us. It means were trusting that God is bigger than the world (this belief crushes fear) and that he will guide us into action that brings us freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A story of peace:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have a discipline where I take 30 minutes out of my work week, every week, and sit quietly with God. I used to wrestle with whether I was in the right job, should I be doing more, doing something different, making more of an impact, etc. What I heard clearly in one of those quiet times was that I was exactly where God wanted me and he would let me know if and when that needed to change. Receiving that (i.e. believing that), created for me an incredible level of peace. I no longer need to wrestle with the inner turmoil of those questions. I keep my head down, work hard on what is in front of me, and rest in the knowledge that God has me where he wants me. And that is a peaceful place to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I still check in weekly to make sure Im in the right place, but I rest easy knowing that hell make it abundantly clear when its time to make changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>In the past couple of weeks, maybe youve identified an area where you need peace. This might be a hard step, but take this moment to promise God that you are turning that worry/issue over to him. Not just for the time being, but completely.</p>
