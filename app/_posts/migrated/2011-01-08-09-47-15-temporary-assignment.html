<p class=\"noPspace\">I&rsquo;m excited to tell you that my husband &amp; I are taking a temporary assignment in Mamelodi, South Africa. For the next six months we&rsquo;ll be helping move the initiative forward in a variety of ways.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll dive into the Charity &amp; Faith community, help at the AIDS hospice, host a few medical trips, capture some &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; stories and enjoy the adventure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">We&rsquo;ll be sure to keep you posted, so stay tuned by reading this blog or get twitter alerts by following @Andrea_Summer. &nbsp;I hope to share new music with you &amp; maybe a video of my attempt to drive on the OPPOSITE side of the road. &nbsp;&nbsp;Though we will miss our community, family &amp; fav Cincy food, Tye &amp; I feel INCREDIBLY BLESSED to go on this adventure. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">If you&rsquo;re interested in going to Mamelodi, there will be several opportunities to do so this year. Info is coming your way this month.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s to adventures!</p>
