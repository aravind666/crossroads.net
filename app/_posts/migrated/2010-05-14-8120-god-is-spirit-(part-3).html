<p>God is Spirit (Part 3)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study His nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Psalm%20139:7-10&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Psalm 139:7-10</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God is not bound by physical laws. He isnt bound to being in one place at one time. He is able to be present everywhere at once in a way that we, and even other spiritual beings, cant. Hes also not bound by the limitations of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reality that God is not bound by the same constraints that we are means that he is able to be present with us in ways that we cant even imagine. God is able to enter into our pain, our joy and even our thoughts and be with us. God is not running out of time or resources for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does imagining God being with you right now (He is!) make you feel?</li>
<li>How would it change your life if you were to imagine God being present with you all the time?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to send you reminders today of his being present with you. Ask Him to show you that he is always with you.</p>
