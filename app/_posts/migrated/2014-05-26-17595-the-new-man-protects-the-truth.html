<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Daily continues to explore what the Bible says about men. This week, well focus on how the New Man is a protector.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you find, listen and love the truth.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Titus 2:6-8</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In a world with Wikipedia and Google it is hard to imagine a question for which we cant find the answer. But those who want to grow intellectually are in search of wisdom and truth. There are a lot of answers, but not all of them are true. A man seeks to be an intellectual protector---that means he is not easily tossed back and forth by every kind of information that comes his way. Instead, he searches out the truth, and is made even more confident when it is discovered.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we hear conflicting information were quick to jump to conclusions. Today, be determined to seek the truth in your work, relationships and your time with God. </p>
