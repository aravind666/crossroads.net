<p class="noPspace"><em>CSM student Ben von Korff traveled to India with a small team from Crossroads earlier this year. They visited aftercare homes in Mumbai and Kolkata as part of their trip. In this entry, Ben shares his story of finding hope in a hopeless situation.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">On August 3, 2010, our team visited a government-run aftercare home in  Mumbai. This is the place where a girl rescued from human trafficking  goes to begin her rehabilitation process. As we entered this place it  was reasonable to assume that we would be experiencing something that  would bring us down in spirit. I at least believed that we were going to  witness a seeming bleakness and hopelessness. God however, had  something else in mind for us. Here is what happened upon entering the  home:</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Twelve of us entered a room with a cold concrete floor and florescent  lighting. As we looked across the room seventy beautiful girls returned  equally inquisitive looks. We proceeded to sit in front of the girls  where we would play a song. Scott Dill, one of our team members,  announced that he would play a song from a Bollywood movie, <em>Three Idiots.</em> The songs chorus is  in English while the rest of song is in Hindi (most of the girls  native language). As we sang the chorus, many of the girls recognized  the song and returned with a verse from the song in Hindi. As we sang, an immediate connection  formed between us and the girls. The Kingdom of God was in that home,  we were singing with girls who we had never met. We were experiencing  joyous singing with girls who not only live 8,000 miles away, but that  have a past that makes joy appear to be a long shot. </p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">After we sang,  everyone was instructed to pair up for the next activity. In this  activity each girl would receive a pad of paper and colored pencils to  draw their partners face. I paired up with a girl named Anjani (not her  real name). Anjani wore a purple kirta with an orange scarf and had a  beautiful, simple smile. </p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">As partners around the room began  to settle in, the laughter began. From pair to pair laughs were  exchanged. Soon Anjani and I would be joining the laughter. I began to  draw her face with as much precision as my ability allowed and I have to  admit, it wasnt bad. As she saw my drawing however, she began to laugh  at my inability to draw. Soon she began to draw me and she too began  hysterically laughing. As the only natural reaction, I also began  laughing. </p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">It was at this point that something very  interesting happened. I felt connected to Anjani as if she were my  family, as if we had known each other for years. If there is evidence  for the existence of God here it is: two strangers from totally  different backgrounds, after three minutes of drawing each others face,  sense a family like connection through laughter, as if they were of the  same father.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">I began to try speaking with Anjani, but  she did not understand me. Soon the girls around me told me that she  knew no English. After some urging by her peers however, she practiced  what she did know by saying, Hello, my name is Anjani, I am seventeen  years old. I responded, Hello, my name is Ben, I am  seventeen years old.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">There were many giggles exchanged between girls  as I announced my age. I laughed as well while internally many emotions  rushed through me. Here I was in the presence of a girl my age that had  been rescued from the sex trade. She had probably been raped on a daily  basis for a period of time and there she was laughing. I,on the other  hand, have had a very different past and speak a foreign language, but  we shared that moment, connected in what I believe was the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">So what was India like? My experience was hope in the midst of  apparent hopelessness, joy in the midst of brokenness, beauty in the  midst of seeming ugliness, and mostly God redeeming his people.</p>
