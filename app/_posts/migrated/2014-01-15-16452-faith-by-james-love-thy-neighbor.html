<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for an open mind to whatever he wants to teach you today. Pray that what He says moves you to action.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A8&amp;version=CEB&amp;interface=print">James 2:8</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A28-31&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Mark 12:28-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">James outright tells us its wrong to have favorites; to treat others like theyre beneath us. He even quotes the big guy: Jesus. But we do it all the time. We go out to dinner and treat the server differently than if we invited them to dinner. The intern at work gets the coffee because he hasnt earned trust to do anything else. At work and in our social groups, there is someone we look at and treat differently. But lets do what Jesus says: Love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of someone or a type of person in your life who you treat as a person beneath you or not worth your time. Take an action today that shows Gods love to that person. You might not get thanked or even acknowledged, but gratitude isnt the reason for doing this.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 9</a></p>
