<p>Forgiving Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway Matthew 18:21-35" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2018:21-35&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 18: 21-35</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Its inevitable: You are going to hurt others, and they are going to hurt you. A primary risk of living a life in community is that you will be hurt by someone else. Even Jesus disciples experienced this messy side of community, arguing over who will be greatest among them. Eventually, they ask Jesus how many times they have to forgive their brothers. Ten? Twenty? They were looking for a numbera rule to follow before harboring bitterness and resentment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The thing is, the Kingdom isnt governed by a rule or a law. Its fueled by forgiveness. Jesus understands this, so he offers up a story that points to unlimited grace. If you have received the grace that a relationship with Jesus affords you, Jesus requires that you give that grace to others. He doesnt ask that you forgive your brother ten times or twenty times; the answer is much more simple. People who follow Jesus forgive every time, because they deeply understand how theyve been forgiven every time for their sins by Christ himself. And by practicing forgiveness, you and your community will find freedom from the bondage of bitterness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Forgiveness isnt for the person that wronged you, its for you. So dont take this as your ticket to call up your friend and let him know that you forgive him for being such a jerk. Not OK. Instead, think of people you need to forgive, then let God know you are ready to forgive them. Let Got know that youre sorry youve held onto bitterness, and invite him into that area of your life. Write a note (it doesnt need to be sent), record a message, or simply practice releasing the hurt and pain you carry with you.</p>
