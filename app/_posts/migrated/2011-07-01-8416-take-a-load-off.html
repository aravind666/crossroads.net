<p>Take a Load Off</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me see your heart for work, and for rest, in my life.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034:21&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Exodus 34:21</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>After God created the world he rested. It wasnt like he said, Whew! I just cant create another universe today, Im beat! Rather, God includes rest as a part of the work cycle. God designed us with a need to rest, and so he modeled this discipline for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can work really hard, but no matter what is going on, you need a break. Consider the many laws given to the Israelites that emphasized the need to rest: Harvest season or plowing season, free or slave, Israeli or foreignereveryone is commanded to rest. Even when our livelihood depends on the work, God still says, rest. Reject the temptation to feel guilty, but rather understand that resting is an act of obedience to God. Reclaim work by knowing that you were designed to rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>This week, set aside a day to rest. Or if you cant find a day, start with finding a few hours and work your way up to a day. Consider how you can incorporate this discipline into your life.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 2</a></p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content.</em></p>
<p><em>These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, weve considered how weve turned Gods plans for work into something else. And weve seen a few ways we can reclaim Gods plan for work in our lives. You dont have to be a slave to your work; you can find freedom in work, by trusting God. Which, admittedly, is a pretty radical idea. But isnt that the fun of it?</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>How have you personally changed the meaning of work from Gods original idea of work?</li>
<li>What steps can you take to start reclaiming Gods plan of work in your life?</li>
<li>Reflecting on the last two weeks, what was the most impactful message for you to hear? How can you keep that message in mind as you continue to work for the rest of the year?</li>
</ul>
