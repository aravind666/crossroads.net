<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A24-31&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Acts 17:24-31</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul found himself in one of the most religious cities in the world: Athens. The city was filled with statues the Greeks idolized and worshipped---and it was easy because they could see and touch these idols. Pauls words to the Greeks speak to a common struggle we still face today: when we cant see or touch God, we find other things to put in his place. We worship our own idols. But God wants us to seek him. When we do, we will find him.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What idols could be keeping you from seeking God? It could be money, food, work, or a relationship. Think of one thing you idolize. Today, dont make it a priority.</p>
