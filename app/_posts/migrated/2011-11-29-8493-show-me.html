<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Spend some time focusing on God as an inviter. Ask Him to reveal this part of his nature to you.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Weve gotten an invitation from God that others begged to receive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moses,  an adopted child who ends up leading a suffering nation into freedom,  tells God one day that he wants to experience Gods full glory. The  backstory is that Moses has already experienced the intense power of God  and miracles so astonishing that people will never stop talking about  them. But now Moses is asking for something deeply personal: a  relationship with the Creator. God, however, denied Moses request  because His full presence, in its perfection, couldnt mingle with the  broken world. So Moses, living before Jesus came into our world, dies  without the intimate relationship he begged to get.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And  thats the same intimate relationship into which were invited. Because  Jesus came with the invitation the moment he was born.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Its  probably not a long shot to assume many of us think that if only we  could see God divide an ocean in half or bring a crazed dictator to his  knees, then that would be an invitation to which wed RSVP. Is there something youre waiting for God to do? Talk to Him about it.</p>
