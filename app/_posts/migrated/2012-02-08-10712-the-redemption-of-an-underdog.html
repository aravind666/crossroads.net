<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">As weve considered this week, underdogs win only when they acknowledge their weaknesses, lean into Gods grace and pursue the right things that bring life. King David stopped doing these things, had an adulterous affair with a woman named Bathsheba, and murdered her husband to cover up an unwanted pregnancy. Talk about a fall from grace.  So what did David (the underdog) do when he failed? Psalm 51 is Davids prayer after his affair with Bathsheba and the fallout that ensued. Even in the midst of his great failure, David believed God still had unfailing love for him, and he was right. In fact, among all the generations detailed in the first chapter of the book of Matthew, only Abraham and David are mentioned by name in the summary of Jesus lineage in verse 17.  Despite Davids failures, God still used him in mighty ways. Because he acknowledged his weaknesses and leaned into Gods grace, David finished strong as an underdog.</p>
