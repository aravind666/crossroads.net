<p>Favor</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute or two in quiet with God, allowing him to be close with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>"Peace  on earth" has a feel-good and familiar ring to it. Yet as we see in  Luke, theres more to that phrase. The angelic beings say: "on earth,  peace to men on whom his favor rests." On whom his favor rests. If this part sounds exclusive, thats because it is. But maybe not for the reason we think.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God is full of grace and he loves us, no  strings attached. But we will only experience the fullness of peace  (shalom) when were aligning ourselves with Him and obeying his commands  for our life. As our creator, He understands each of us perfectly. He  knows what will make us flourish. And this is why obedience leads to  peace. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Try  following this command today: "But now you must also rid yourselves of  all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy  language from your lips" (Colossians 3:8). Then see what measure of  peace God brings you.</p>
