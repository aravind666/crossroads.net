our 2008 "all church journey" is now in week three. (Gee..where do the weeks go?) This past weekend, Chuck Mingo shared about how debt is bondage, but there is freedom to be found on the other side. We also heard some amazing stories from within our community of people who have overcome their issues with debt.<br><br>As always, if you missed the service (slacker) you can <a href="/">listen to the talk</a>, or <a href="/">watch it</a><a href="/">.</a> <br>Also, for those <strong>Trendspotting</strong> fans among us, here's the link to the <a href="/">Demetri Martin Daily Show clip</a>.<br><a href="/"></a><br>If you didn't get one last weekend, you can also <a href="/">download the Consumed Guide</a> (as a PDF), and find a <a href="/">Consumed group</a>. (<em>Note: Study Notes will be suspended for the Consumed Journey because we're all working through the Consumed Guides.</em>)<br><br>Feel free to share any thoughts or reactions to the weekend in the comments.</body></html>
