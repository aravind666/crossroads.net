Sign-ups for<a href=\"../my/connect/communityGroups.php\" title=\"Comm Group page\"> community groups</a> are under way. One of the more popular groups is Dave Ramsey's <strong>Financial Peace University,</strong>
which teaches about eliminating debt, staying out of debt, building
wealth and learning to live more generously. Sasha and Therese, a
couple who completed FPU last spring, talk about why it's a great
community group.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you sign up for FPU?</strong><br />We
were striving to be better stewards of our money.&nbsp; We had always had
some type of budget; however, we never really paid attention to the
fact that we would go over in several categories.&nbsp; We knew we needed
help.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>What made the greatest impact on you?</strong><br />The
biggest impact was teaching us to know and&nbsp; change our behavior
patterns.&nbsp; Everyone knows you should save more and spend less. It's
actually doing it that's tough.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Why would you recommend this class to others?</strong><br />Yes.&nbsp; It was all very practical and useful -- not over our heads.&nbsp; God truly blessed us by allowing us to attend FPU.<br /><br />FPU starts this Saturday, but it's not too late to <a href=\"../my/connect/communitygroups/CG-DescFinancialPeaceUniversitySaturdaymornings.htm\" title=\"FPU sign up\">sign up.</a>
