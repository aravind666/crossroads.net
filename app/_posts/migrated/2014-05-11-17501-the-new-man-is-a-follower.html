<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man is a Follower</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><br>The New Man follows before he leads. This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about men who have been rewarded for remaining diligent, accountable, and connected to God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you be a better follower.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A1-11&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 5:1-11</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">It can be scary to try something new. We become anxious about the unknown, even afraid of it. When Jesus chose his twelve disciples, it took a lot for each of them to drop what they were doing to follow Him. But we know they all went on to do some pretty sweet stuff (with one exception). Jesus calls all men to do this. He calls us to lead. First, like the disciples, we must be willing to follow.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God where youre leading when you should be following? Spend a minute and think about it. When something comes to mind, take a step following in that direction.</p>
