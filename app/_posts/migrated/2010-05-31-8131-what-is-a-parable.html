<p><strong>Week 1: Parables</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, May 31</strong></p>
<p>What is a Parable?</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p><strong><br><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew%2013:10-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 13:10-17</a></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Great communicators use the tools at their disposal to convey their point, and Jesus was no exception. In ancient Jewish culture, there was a mode of storytelling referred to as a parable, or hard saying. Stories like this would often catch the listener off guard, forcing them to wrestle with some nugget of truth. Parables werent easy learning, thoughyou had to work for it, to ponder and struggle for the meaning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus put a twist on things, though. He used parables not just to convey truth, but also to shed light on Gods way of doing things.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Put simply, biblical parables are descriptions of how Gods kingdom works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think Jesus would communicate like this? Why would he make his message difficult to understand?</li>
<li>How is God challenging you to understand him more right now?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>You may have already heard the stories well be talking about these next couple weeks, and it can be easy to assume we already know what they mean. Yet for each of these, there is more that God wants to show usso spend a few minutes asking God to help you see these parables with fresh eyes.</p>
