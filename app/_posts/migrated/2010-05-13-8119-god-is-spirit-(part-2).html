<p>God is Spirit (Part 2)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study His nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:16-26&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:16-26</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The passage we read today talks about the Fruits of the Spirit, a subject we looked at in detail a few weeks ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most people look at a list like this and immediately feel intimidated; in part, that happens because we generally begin by looking at where we fall short.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember, this is a picture of what life lived with Gods Spirit looks like; it is not a checklist we have to live up to. This is the great thing about a relationship with God. As we grow closer to Him and allow his Spirit to flow through us, we begin to bear the fruit of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Fruit of the Spirit do you see God beginning to form in you? How do you know?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Write the Fruits of the Spirit on a post-it note and put it on your mirror. In the morning when you see it, pray this simple prayer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear God, help me to be open to allow your Spirit to flow through me today. Thank you.</p>
