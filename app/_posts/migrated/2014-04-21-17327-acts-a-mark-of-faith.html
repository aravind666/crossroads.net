<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: A Mark of Faith</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the last few weeks, The Daily has taken a deeper look at the book of Acts. This week, well finish our study of how its lessons apply to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to strengthen your faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+25%3A8-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 25:8-12</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">In Pauls self-defense he makes a serious claim: If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. Whoa. Hes willing to die. This is the mark of his faith. Hes 100 percent all in. Hes up close and personal with some of the Roman Empires mightiest (and arguably scariest) officials. But Paul never backs down from his innocence and he stakes his life on his faith in Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What would have to happen or would you need to do for your faith to look and feel like Pauls? Think and write about what it would be like to have a 100 percent faith and what you can do to get there.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+25&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 25</a></p>
