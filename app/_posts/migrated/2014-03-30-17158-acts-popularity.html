<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Monday, March 31</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Acts: Popularity</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the next few weeks, The Daily will follow the book of Acts and look at how we can apply its lessons to our own lives.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God for wisdom to make the right decisions.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7%3A54-60&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 7:54-60</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You might be thinking this a heavy story to read on a Monday morning. But Stephens story is about trusting and obeying God even when it feels like the most unpopular thing you can do. He was charged with blasphemy in front of everybody. In his defense, he retells the stories of people who were considered outcasts like Joseph and David, yet had Gods approval. His approval is all that matters and weve always had it, even when we feel unpopular and not part of the in-crowd.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We all have to make unpopular choices. Whether at work or at home, if you have to make a decision today that could be unpopular, trust that God will help you make it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE BOOK OF ACTS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 6</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Acts 7</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>EAT CHEAPLY, CHANGE THE WORLD</strong></p>
