<p>Encouraging Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, consider the fact that the Lord created you for relationship, and that his deepest desire is for intimate relationship with you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway 2 Corinthians 7:12-14" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2corinthians%207:12-14&amp;version=NIV">2 Corinthians 7:12-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Heres a multiple-choice test. (Dont worry, theres no grade.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Who would you rather spend time with:</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. Someone who consistently critiques you?</p>
<p>B. Someone who consistently embarrasses you?</p>
<p>C. Someone who consistently encourages you?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets assume you chose C. So, are you that type of person? In the passage for today, Paul is encouraging the church in Corinth for their devotion to the faith, and personally thanking them for their encouragement of his close friend, Titus, who was refreshed by his time with the believers in this church. Yes! Thats what encouragement does. It refreshes us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever known someone who refreshes and strengthens others? Its a life-giving thing, and within the context of your own community, encouragement can go a long way to deepening your ties to someone else. When you see something that looks like Jesus in a friend, tell them about it. Its harder to see things in ourselves, so lend courage to a friend by spelling out how their life helps you know Jesus more. Its not scary; its encouragement. And it looks like a biblical definition of friendship.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to bring to mind a few friends, and consider ways theyve impacted your life. Take a moment and let them know. Make a call, write an email (do it over Facebook if you must), but practice intentionality and encourage a few friends. Then watch how your community is refreshed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
