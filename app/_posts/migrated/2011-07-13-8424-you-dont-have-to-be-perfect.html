<p>You Dont Have to Be Perfect</p>

<p><em>God, do not let my fear of failure get in the way of doing your will.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Rahab  was a prostitute, rejected by society. She was not a person who most of  us would expect to be used by God. But God worked through Rahab, and  because of her help, Joshua and the Israelites eventually toppled the  walls of Jericho.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rumors about the coming invasion were all over the city, and living on the city wall,</p>
<p>Rahab was especially vulnerable. But she didnt let her fear get the best of her. She</p>
<p>knew that God was in charge, and that he wanted the Israelites to conquer the land of</p>
<p>Jericho.  So, she put her trust in the Lord and hid the spies at great personal  risk. As a result, God rewarded her. This prostitute became one of Gods  people and even became a part of the lineage of Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>None  of us are perfect, and we all sin. Yet God has big plans for us, and  desires us to advance the Kingdom. There is no sin in your life that  changes Gods mind about you or his plans for you. Do you have a  specific sin in your life that is keeping you from being obedient to  God? If so, ask for His forgiveness and ask him what his will is for you  in that area of your life.</p>
