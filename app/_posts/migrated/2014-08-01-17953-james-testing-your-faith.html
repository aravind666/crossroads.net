<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>James: Testing Your Faith</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Last week, we read the entire book of James. This week, were focusing on one passage and going phrase by phrase.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>JAMES 1:2-4</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday we talked about how James looks reality square in the face. All of us will experience trials in some way--whether its physical suffering, the temptation to fall into an old habit or just the daily grind. We cant prevent these tests. But instead of letting them derail or immobilize us, James reminds us that we can be strengthened through them. And then were more fully prepared for the next round.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think of an area of your life where you feel like God has strengthened you--a trial by fire of sorts. Is there someone who would be encouraged by your experience? Today, look for a chance to share it.</p>
