<p>Before the Beginning: God had an Enemy</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me understand my enemy and stand strong in your protection</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2014:12-15&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>; <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:10-17&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 6:10-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Spiritual warfare is real. God created angelic beings and one of them chose to rebel out of pride. Satan wanted to live independent of Gods authority, and his fateful choice literally caused all hell to break loose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a result of his choice, he was eternally separated from God. His response? To make it his lifelong mission to influence as many people as possible to join him in a life of rebellion against a loving God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But thankfully, God is also on a lifelong mission to redeem the very people Satan tries to take down, and God strengthens those who trust in him. So even though we take bullets in this life, and we will struggle with sin, we can stand strong in Gods protective care.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Go back to Ephesians chapter 6 and list out the armor of God mentioned in verses 14-17. As you list each piece, ask God to teach you how to use this armor to be spiritually strong.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 10</a></p>
