<p class="noPspace">Have you ever turned your faith walk or relationship with God into a task list? You can be doing this whether you feel like you are failing or succeeding at that list. The guy in the story that buries the money is the one who keeps the rules, while missing the whole point.God isnt looking for someone to just check boxes, he wants you to engage. He is giving you opportunities everyday to move in your faith and not play it safe. You can be sure that He is giving you opportunities by the mere fact that he has trusted you with resources.</p>
