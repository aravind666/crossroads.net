<p class="noPspace"><strong>MEET SHALIE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">"Most of my journey with God has been me working diligently to earn his love. My earthly father was unable to love me and receive me as he should have, so my life became one big performance. Whether it was being the "good girl", being physically attractive, singing, saying the right things, being super spiritual, achieving academically, being popular, leading a ministry, being the perfect wife and mother, it all left me exhausted, resulting in feelings of depression and hopelessness. I was in bondage to this performance "thing". Although I knew that the Father was alive and well in my life, it felt as if I hadnt fully received all that He had for me.</p>

<p class="noPspace">"Recently, I was in a position of weakness, where I was unable to perform for God and others in the way Im most comfortable. I was in a vulnerable place, in which receiving from God was the only option. A couple of close friends prayed over me in a way that made me not feel fear, or care about what others think of me, and only receive my Fathers love for me. This was probably the most loved and received Ive ever felt from God. I was simply receiving how the Father feels about me, which is that he loves me perfectly, completely and, most of all, unconditionally! Nothing that I could do or say could change how much He loves me and receives me just for existing! He sees me as his precious daughter, in whom he delights! I RECEIVE!"</p>
