<p class="noPspace">In <a title="Amazon Link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Understanding-Poverty-2009-Printing/dp/B001A1MDGM"><em>A Framework for  Understanding Poverty</em></a>, Dr. Ruby Payne defines poverty as the  “extent to which one does without resources.” These resources are not  just financial; they relate to a person’s emotional well-being, mental  abilities/education, support systems, relationships, and more.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Most of us don’t think  about our lives in terms of resources—but we all have a specific  measure of them; and we belong to a specific economic culture based on  those resources and the shared beliefs, norms and practices that  correspond with them. These cultural practices guide us and provide a  value system that we pass along to our families, perpetuating practices  for generations to come.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">How can a specific resource level  influence a cultural practice/value? Let’s look at one example:  Financial resource is defined by having the money to purchase goods and  services. If you have limited income, your primary objective is to pay  for your basic needs: food, clothing, housing. If there is literally not  enough money remaining—then there is limited opportunity or reason to  practice money management skills, and therefore, little to no  transference of those skills to your family. What you practice becomes a  norm generationally unless there is an intervening relationship,  resource or opportunity that introduces a new way of thinking and  practice.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Now consider a broader view on the impact of  growing up with limited financial resources: With limited financial  resources, someone in poverty may not have built financial management  skills and may have developed mistrust of banking/financial institutions  based on inexperience. He may not have had a relationship with an adult  who had a salaried job, and thus does not understand the practical  importance of education and skill development for career employment.  Career advancement is based on long-term patterns of employment, and if  there are little to no family members with career jobs—then he may not  have developed practical value for a consistent work history which can  impact overall income.</p>
