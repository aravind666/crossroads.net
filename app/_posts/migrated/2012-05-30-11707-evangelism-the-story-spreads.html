<p class="noPspace"><strong>Evangelism: The Story Spreads</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were learning about evangelism by studying Pauls words to the Colossians.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all his people--the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true word of the gospelthat has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world--just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood Gods grace.<strong>You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><em>Colossians 1:3-8<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001C2qJ-4xUhUXbgG3ul7OOrCJMboiOrW--N42VDRSfuZoUOTCcrC207n2NavtzZrqeSpLKj_Ybr2N0tHyH6UOJkSqvHOxwRewyPsMUIaRJ9dMenF0gGb3Nc6nK64TXY7vSm1HM_Ph9vWDKN9oK7uS-3fG-ap_gfuNEKZmm2mE2NhYKcrj2HvrJ9A==" target="_blank">(TNIV)</a></em></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>In the above passage, we see three generations of believers: Paul to his disciple Epaphras to the believers in Colossae. When the motive is love and the message is Jesus, evangelism begets evangelism. Our personal, compelling stories are bound to spread.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong><em>You can use these questions to spark conversation with people who also do The Daily.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Yesterday, we considered how Jesus is marking our life--and how that makes a personally compelling story. Share a story with each other.</li>
<li>Who are the people in your "backyard" setting (i.e., people you interact with often and care about)? Of those people, who might need your compelling story right now--even if it seems like a long shot?</li>
</ul>
