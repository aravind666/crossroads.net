<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Build Leaders: Offer</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God has given each one of us gifts to offer up to help serve someone else. Today we look at how we can offer our labor. Focus on verse 5.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:1-5&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Genesis 39:1-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Although Joseph wasnt in an ideal working environment being a slave, God blessed Potiphars house simply because Joseph was in it. Many of us are in situations that we dont particularly love--it can feel like we are doing the daily grind. When we offer up our labor to God and allow him to be glorified first, our actions will be blessed. That can look like offering our time, our actual work or our intentions.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write down ways that you can be present and offer your time so that it honors God. Trust that he will bless it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201%20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 1 </a></p>
