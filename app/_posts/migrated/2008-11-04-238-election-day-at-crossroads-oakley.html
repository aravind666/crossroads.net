<html><body><p>Crossroads Oakley is serving as a polling location again this year. Many residents in the Oakley area will vote at Crossroads and enjoy some free coffee (yes, Starbucks is giving it away today, too, but ours is better and the lines are shorter). Because it's a big election year, Local 12 is even broadcasting live from Crossroads all morning. If you get a chance, check it out.</p></body></html>
