<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Kingdom Come: Dan</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Read Dans story of what happened when he submitted to the King.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>DANS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I had been abusing alcohol in one way or another since I was a teenager and it created many problems in my life. Not only for me, but for the people I really cared about. After two failed marriages and a DUI, I moved to Cincinnati, happy to start a new life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Life seemed great. After about a year I met Brenda, an awesome woman, and we started dating. Shortly after, I made a bad decision and drove while intoxicated, receiving my second DUI. I had been great at hiding my drinking from Brenda and I thought this would change everything. But she didnt run for the hills. She stayed with me. This was Gods first big move.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ordered by the court, I went to 12 weeks of intense group therapy, 1:1 counseling and AA sessions. I made it through all of this, fell in love and married my girlfriend. But I never stopped drinking. I figured I had it under control. I just had to change my habits, no more than a couple of drinks. Little by little my drinking habits started creating problems in my marriage.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Four years ago I made the decision to get baptized. Afterwards, God came to me and said very plainly, If you want to serve me, you must serve Brenda and quit drinking. It was that simple, you must quit drinkingright now! So I did. Right that day. After years of abusing alcohol, I didnt quit until that day when God gave me the courage, the strength, the wisdom and the Holy Spirit to guide me. I could not do it without God. Now, Im living a life without alcohol, and I am in a marriage that will last forever! I am living in Gods Kingdom and it is sweet!</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Dan submitted his life and his addiction to God. When he did, he experienced the freedom that comes when you obey your Dad. Read it aloud in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:44-45&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Psalm 119:44-45</a>.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether its hitting the snooze button, gossiping, or your daily pumpkin spice lattequit it. Just for today, find one thing and quit it. Ask your Dad to guide you through it and write down how quitting this activity might have brought you freedom.</p>
