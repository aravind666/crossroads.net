<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, Laura shares how receiving Gods love filled her up more than any romantic movie, song or TV show.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>LAURAS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I love a good love story. But I allowed them to influence my thoughts and feelings. I found myself wondering when my own Mr. Darcy would come to sweep me off my feet. My life didnt look like I thought it was "supposed" to look, and I believed the lie that I needed romantic love to add value to my life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">These feelings that my life was empty without romantic love typically brought on a major depression. I cried out to God to help me. He revealed to me that the messages from music, TV and movies are not his messages. I clearly heard Him say that I needed to do a "Romance Fast"--no more Twilight movies, love stories, or romantic music.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">My depression dissolved into peace as I began to focus on how love is defined according to the Kingdom of God. I no longer needed to seek validation through romantic loveGod already loves me with a deeper love than I can imagine.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">My "fast" turned into a way of life. I want to know love according to the Kingdom of God and that means quieting the loud voices of the kingdom of the world.</p>
