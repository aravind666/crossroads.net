<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Goodness: Dialect</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We continue in Ephesians 5 as we look at Gods good purpose for sexuality. Today, we look at practices.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:3-5&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Ephesians 5:3-5</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yesterday we talked about stepping away from a consumerist, self-focused view on sex. Today, we see what the mindset of what can I get? leads to. The downhill momentum leads to bad sexual choices, gossip (locker room talk) and bad use of our language. If we can take our eyes off of objectifying people, we can put our eyes back on the One who created us. We can rediscover worshipping God (someone we are intended to give thanks to) without being constantly distracted by worshipping skin.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Write a letter to God telling him about the ways in which you are thankful for sexuality.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 13</a>.</p>
