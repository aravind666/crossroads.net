<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God has all that you are looking for and if you seek, knock and ask, he wants to be generous toward you. But did you know that what He gives you in response to your seeking, knocking and asking is the Holy Spirit? When you are lost, He doesnt just give you a quick fix, he gives you his full authority through the gift of the Spirit. No really, its like that.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
