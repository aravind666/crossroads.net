<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Value</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve been looking at planting and building this week. Todays verse turns up the heat, but some fires are worth walking through instead of backing away from.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:12-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 3:12-13</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What you are doing and creating in your life might look really good on the outside, or conversely really ordinary. It doesnt matter if its made of gold or wood. What matters is Gods opinion and if Christ is at the center. It doesnt matter if it shines like gold, only God can assess if it has real Kingdom value.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Journal today about something in your life that might not be what it seems. It might look good but isnt, or it might be unassuming, but its totally God.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 1</a></p>
