<p>The Double Portion</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see where you can take action and experience the miraculous.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Elijah  was an amazing prophet who performed 14 miracles during his life. When  he was about to die, Elisha (his sidekick) asked God to perform a  "double portion" of miracles through him. Most of us might think thats  kind of forward, a little aggressive. Even Elijah responded, "You have  asked a difficult thing." But God granted his wish: Elisha performed 28  miracles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elisha  asked God for something with boldness. He didnt want to sit by and  passively miss an opportunity. He seized it. And God loved that. What if  Elisha had sat back and said, "Whatever number you want to give me God,  is fine with me." Would he have experienced any miracles?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes the difference in our lives is just asking God for a double portion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend some time talking to God. What area in your life would you like to see more of Him? Ask Him to give you a double portion.</p>
