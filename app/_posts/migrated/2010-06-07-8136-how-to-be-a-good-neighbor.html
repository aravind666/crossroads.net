<p><strong>Week 2: Parables</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, June 7</strong></p>
<p>How To Be a Good Neighbor</p>
<p><em><br>Take a moment and ask God to reveal truth and meaning to you through Jesus stories.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>

<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, And who is my neighbor?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine that: a religious person wanting to make themselves look good. Much to his disappointment, Jesus doesnt play along. He tells this story about a man in need, who sees two different religious leaders pass him by and completely ignore him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Who helps? The Samaritan. (Or for Jesus audience, you might say half-breed, traitor, or outcastbecause in their eyes, the terms were interchangeable.) Yet this is the exact person who helps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember that parables are pictures of what Gods kingdom looks like. It isnt based on religious titles, social standing, ethnic heritage, background, wealth, or anything else that we tend to use to make ourselves look better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its all about whether or not we love as God would.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you think of a time in your life when you acted like one of the religious leaders? What was your reason?</li>
<li>Can you think of a time when you helped someone in need? What was your reason?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Even if were doing the right things, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that our actions make us acceptable to Godto start justifying ourselves based on what we do or dont do. Yet it is our motivationsour love for othersthat makes the difference. Take a few minutes and ask God if there is someone in your life who is in need of experiencing his love from you. Once youve decided on someone, commit to loving him or her TODAY in some kind of practical way.</p>
