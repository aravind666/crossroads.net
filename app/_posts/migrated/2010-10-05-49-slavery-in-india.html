<p class="noPspace">According to Ben Skinner in his book<a href="http://www.acrimesomonstrous.com/">A Crime So Monstrous</a>, there are 10 to 20 million slaves in India. That means there are more slaves inIndiathan anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">For the past seven years,Indiahas been ranked as a Tier 2 Watch List country in the U.S. State Departments <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/index.htm">Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report</a>. This means it is not in compliance with Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, that the number of victims of trafficking in the country is staggering, and that the government is not taking appropriate actions to end the problem.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">It is the opinion of the U.S. Government that theGovernment of India is not doing all it should toeliminate slavery. That said, the U.S. does recognize that India has begun making significant effortstoenforce the <span id="shorten_3" title="already-existingIndianlawagainst"><span id="shorten_4" title="already-existingIndianlawagainst">existing laws against slaver</span></span>y. Its all about<em> law enforcement.</em></p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yet even with their law enforcement efforts, men, women and children from the lowest socio-economic backgrounds inIndiaare particularly vulnerable to trafficking, whether its bonded labor or commercial sexual exploitation. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime recently <a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/saipe/saipe.cgi">interviewed</a> my good friend from IJM, Saju Mathew. In this interview, he provides a great overview of the problem of bonded laborIndian men, women and children in debt bondage who are forced to work without pay in brick kilns, rice mills, rock quarries and salt worksand how to combat it.</p>
<p class="noPspace"></p>
<p class="noPspace">Here at Crossroads, were focused on one specific aspect of the slavery problem: combating sex trafficking of children inIndia.
