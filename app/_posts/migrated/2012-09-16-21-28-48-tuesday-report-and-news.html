<p class="noPspace">Good Evening Team,</p>
<p class="noPspace">I’ve been waiting for the report from last Tuesday to review but when it didn’t come I thought I better check the schedule to see who I needed to contact......IT WAS ME! Sorry I forgot.....I was pinch hitting for Rob who had to change dates because of a conflict in his schedule. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">So here goes....testing the memory of an old guy:</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Nate, Dan A., Mike, Dan C.,Will, Gary Matt and a new guy Troy joined me in the Wheels shop. Troy is collision repair specialist for Joseph Automotive (Cadillac) in Florence. He jumped right in, taking on the task of repairing the right side sliding door on the Honda Odyssey before Ryan got a chance to whack it. I have ordered all the necessary parts and will hopefully have them available for Tuesday evening.   </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Nate completed the A/C compressor installation on the Cougar. All that remains is getting the serp belt back on and checking out the rest of the vehicle. Matt offered some encouragement and a lot of elbow grease! I have a new belt there waiting for them....</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Dan A (or P depending on who you are talking to) continued working on the PT Cruiser with his partner Sam. This is the Wheels rendition of the "Odd Couple" but they really work well together and the head is now back on and reassembly continues!</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Mike and Dan C did the assessment on the Miata.. I am trying to locate new steering cooler lines for this twenty year old roadster but the vehicle itself is nice and Mike could not resist lowering the top.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Gary worked his magic on the Sienna van...we agreed that it is something like puttin’ perfume on a pig but when he got ’er done it looked respectable! It runs well and should be the answer to someone’s transportation problems. THIS IS A HIGH MILE VEHICLE WITH MINOR OIL LEAKS and several non-safety issues. It goes "AS IS" with a warning to check the oil level FREQUENTLY!!!</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">While all this was going on John Eric, Jay, Walt, Jerry and Dan H. and several others (notably Patrick from the AV Team) were helping out at the Haupert house this evening. Hopefully Greg gets home soon and is pleased by all their efforts.  I understand that things are really shaping up over there.....</p>
<p class="noPspace">WAY TO GO GUYS! YOU MAKE US ALL VERY PROUD.....</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Saturday was DIY Day at Wheels so there will not be a report other than to tell you that we accepted a very nice older Plymouth Grand Voyager as a donation, adding to the Nissan Maxima and Dodge Caravan we took in earlier, and the Ford Expedition, Toyota Corollas (2), and Pontiac Sedan we expect to have in hand in the next week or so! THE STAGE ANNOUNCEMENT DID THE JOB!</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Jay and John are planning another work session at the Haupert’s for this Tuesday. If this is your talent please contact John to volunteer, but for the rest of you we have plenty to do at the Wheels shop so plan to stop by. We’d love to see you and could sure use a hand.... </p>
