<p>Lions in the Street</p>
<p><br>God, help me tap into your wisdom today. <br><br><strong>READ</strong> <br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%2026:13-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 26:13-16</a> <br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>Its quite the picture Solomon paints in these verses. Surely no one is that lazy, right? But is it really that far-fetched? The lazy person only wants to rest, fails to do even simple things that will benefit them, wont accept input from someone else, and makes excuses the whole time (i.e. the lion in the street).  Ouch. Put in those terms, maybe laziness hits a little closer to home. Each of these things, in their own way, are moments where we refuse to be challenged and grow. The heart behind laziness actually has less to do with inactivity and more to do with complacency.  <br><br><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>Complacency starts most often in the small, unnoticed areas of life. Spend a few minutes asking God what one specific thing you need to do to root out laziness today. Once he shows you, do it as soon as possible. <br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Colossians%203:23-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Colossians 3:23-24</a></p>
