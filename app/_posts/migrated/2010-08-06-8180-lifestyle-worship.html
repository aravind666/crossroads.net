<p>Lifestyle Worship</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Before you begin, ask God to give you eyes to see him in the world around you, and to experience him throughout your day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Chronicles%2016:29-34&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Chronicles 16:29-34</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAKE ACTION</strong></p>
<p>As our last look into worship, its time to ask God how this lifestyle of worship weve been examining can be a reality in your own life. At some point in the next day or two, head outside into nature (your backyard totally counts).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Get on the ground, look to the sky, or get close to a tree. Stop and examine whats happening: all the activity, the life that teems right under our feet or over our heads. In the quietness of that moment, ask God to reveal areas in your life where opportunities for worship teem right under your nose but you havent noticed them. Ask God to illuminate these moments for you at all times, so that a lifestyle of worship would become a mark on your life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then just be still and listen. Record any thoughts or promptings you have in this time.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the last two weeks weve looked at worship in a context different than the two songs to start a church service variety. Hopefully, youve discovered new ways you can worship God, and new avenues you can connect with him apart from a weekly gathering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig out the list you made from Day 1 of this study, asking for your definition of worship. How has your definition changed or not changed?</li>
<li>What has been the most surprising way of worship to you, during these past two weeks? Had you ever considered it as an worship before?</li>
<li>How will you continue to implement these things into your lifestyle of worship?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
