<p class="noPspace">After her mother sent hert to live a life of bondage in the brothels of Sonagachi, Samudri* was rescued by local law enforcement earlier this year  with the help of <a title="International Justice Mission" href="/">International Justice Mission</a> (IJM)’s offices in Mumbai and Kolkata.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Since then, Samudri has been in  the care of an IJM partner aftercare home. For months, Crossroads volunteers have  been praying alongside IJM for Samudri as IJM social workers engaged with  her, giving her love, encouragement and support, despite her negative attitude  and dejected disposition.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Recently, an IJM social worker shared a  breakthrough with the rest of the IJM-Mumbai team: Samudri has been formally enrolled in  the 10<sup>th</sup> standard English medium and a joyful spirit has renewed her! The  superintendent of the home commended Samudri in front of our social worker, saying that  she was not only making progress in her studies but that she also was excelling at them!  Imagine the smile on Samudri’s face upon hearing such praise. God is performing  miracles in our midst and it is amazing to see the lives of these young women  changing before our very eyes.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">This is why we are dedicated to creating quality aftercare in India, so that we can have many other answered prayers like Samudri. Please continue to keep her and all of the girls who are (or were) victims of forced prostitution as we work to rescue them and then help them build new lives.</p>
