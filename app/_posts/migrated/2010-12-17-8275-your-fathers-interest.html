<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God the Father desired Joseph and Mary to receive personal affirmation.  He wanted them to be assured that their choices would lead to his  promised salvation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God  always wants to assure his children. He knows this world threatens to  distract, even dissuade us, from his promises that are so powerful and  real. Are you assured or dissuaded about Gods interest in you?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong><br>Ponder your reflections on Jesus coming these past few days. Ask God to assure your hope in him.</p>

<p>God  divinely orchestrated Jesus birth to be both lowly and lonely, yet  known to kings, wise men, holy men and prophets. How do you believe God  is working now in your life in small ways that may produce big endings  some day?</p>
