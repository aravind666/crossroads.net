<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Truth: Eternal Life</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily assumes that the Bible is only a big book about God and hes the main character. Well look at verses and mull over what it means for us if what they say is true.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to help you see how he wants you to grow today.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print"><strong>JOHN 5:24</strong></a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgement, but has passed from death to life.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>ASK YOURSELF</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What does it mean to receive eternal life? How does it feel to get this back?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Change your perspective on your day. If youve gained new, eternal life, what becomes important and what falls away?</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 13</a></p>
