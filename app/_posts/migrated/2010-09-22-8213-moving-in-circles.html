<p>Moving in Circles</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God for the faith to follow him, no matter where he leads you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Joshua%206:10-16&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Joshua 6:10-16</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever feel like God is leading you in circles?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every Christ-follower experiences seasons when theres no forward progress. In times like these, faith is a continual choice to trust, obey and keep walking with God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Israel faced an enormous challenge in conquering the walled city of Jericho. We dont know for sure how high the walls were, but estimates range between 15 to 50 feet. Usually when an army laid siege to a walled city, the strategy was a frontal assault. But Gods instructions were quite different: Dont even give a war cry, just walk around the city.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you were given these strange instructions, would they have been easy to follow? Would fear, frustration or doubt lead you to tweak the battle plan or abandon it altogether?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Talk to God about any place you feel like hes leading you in circles. What do you need from Him in order to trust and obey? Ask Him for what you need.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%203:5-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 3:5-6 </a>is a good reminder of the benefits of trusting in God.</p>
