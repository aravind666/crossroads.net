<p>The Invitation to Move</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Pray this prayer: God, today I want to respond to your invitation to move in faith.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2012:1-3&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 12:1-3</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>These last two weeks weve looked at story after story of people who moved in faith and radically experienced God. Jesus friend, Peter, stepped out of a boat and walked on water. David defeated a giant. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego survived a fiery furnace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In all these stories there was an explicit or implicit invitation to move in faith. This same invitation gets extended to us every day. So throw off the things that keep you from moving in faithwhether thats guilt, fear or the need to control. Respond to Gods invitation to move in faith. Then what? Just keep your eyes focused on Jesus and take steps in his direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What keeps you from responding to Gods invitation to move in faith? Ask God right now to set you free from this weight so you can run in his direction.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Week Two Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The Friday edition of The Daily features discussion questions based on the weeks content. These questions are meant to spark conversation with your spouse, your roommate, or a small group of friends who also subscribe to The Daily.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Weve spent the last two weeks looking at people who moved in faith and experienced the miraculous. God extends the same invitation to you. How are you responding?</p>
<ul>
<li>In what area of your life are you feeling encouraged to ask God for the miraculous? Share that thought with someone you trust so they can partner in prayer with you about it.</li>
<li>Is there a particular section of scripture or a particular character from this week who you identify with strongly? Consider doing some further study around that scripture or character. This could mean reading a book about that character, or discussing a section of scripture with a group of people.</li>
</ul>
