<p>Welcome to The Daily.  <a href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">Click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.<br><strong><br>Tuesday, December 1<br></strong>A Healthy Body<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 4:7-13 <br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>Way back in high school biology we were taught that the body is made up of cells, that become groups of cells called tissues, that become groups of tissues called organs, that become groups of organs called systems, that becomeYOU. Put simply, life exists because of vital connections at every level.<br><br>The same is true of the global collection of people who make up the Church. A healthy body of Christ is made up of vital connections at every level. Together this body acts as the hands and feet of Jesus, continuing the mission of transforming love that he began when he walked the earth.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>According to Ephesians 4:13, what is the ultimate goal of the gifts we receive as part of the body of Christ? </li>
<li>No body part can survive without the rest of the body. How have you benefitted from being connected to others?</li>
<li>Have you ever thought about the part you are meant to play in the body? What do you think that might be?</li>
</ul>
<strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Ask God to show you how your gifts can be used in the part of the body to which youre connected (i.e. your local church, your small group, your family, etc.)<br><br><strong>For Further Study:</strong><br>When you have the time, consider checking out these other passages about the body of Christ. Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you how these passages apply to your relationships.<br><br>1 Corinthians 12:12-13:13; Romans 12:3-8<strong><br></strong>
