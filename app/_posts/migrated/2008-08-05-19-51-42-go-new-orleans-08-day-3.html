We're here to partner  with Habitat for Humanity in building homes for displaced New Orleans residents and to love kids from Franklin Avenue Baptist Church by spending time with them.<br><br>Yesterday we took a tour of the entire region by bus. In spite of images and advance warning, I was not prepared for what I saw. Many parts of the greater New Orleans area are still in devastation. It looks like someone dropped a nuclear bomb (a few days ago.) Entire neighborhoods were flattened and haven't been touched in three years. <br><br><strong>Here are a few random tidbits from the  bus tour:</strong><br><ul>
<li>New Orleans Parish is 185 square miles. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, 145 of them were covered with water. Lots of water. Rich and poor alike had their homes completely destroyed.</li>
<li>The 1.5 million residents of the New Orleans region had less than 24 hours warning to evacuate. When many Houston residents tried to evacuate they went 12 miles in that amount of time. </li>
<li>There is nothing French about the French Quarter. It was built by the Spanish. Hmm.</li>
<li> Before Katrina, there were over 3,000 hospital beds in New Orleans Parish. <strong>Today there are less than 500.</strong>
</li>
<li>Before Katrina, the population of New Orleans was a little over 600,000. <strong>After, it's under 300,000.</strong>
</li>
<li>Over 5,000 children were separated from their parents during the
Katrina aftermath.  <strong>The last children were not reunited until March '06
- nearly seven months later.</strong>
</li>
<li>Until 1805 you couldn't live in New Orleans unless you were Catholic. </li>
<li>320,000,000 trees died in the storm.</li>
<li>100,000 homes flooded in the New Orleans metro area.</li>
</ul>Today we began work at the job sites and with the kids. We'll be posting more throughout the week. You can also keep up with the "goings-on" at <a href="">crossroads.net/goneworleans</a>.</body></html>
