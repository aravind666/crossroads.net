<p><strong>Week 1 - Proverbs: Snapshots of Wisdom<br><br>Monday, December 27</strong><br>Snapshots of Wisdom<br><em><br>God, open my mind to the wisdom you have for my life.</em></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Proverbs%201:1-7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 1:1-7</a> <br><br><strong>REFLECT </strong><br>So  what is a proverb, anyway? For many of us, its a short statement  closely related to the fortune cookie. In other words, its disconnected  from real life.But  according to Solomon (writer of most of these things and the wisest guy  who ever lived), the opposite is true. Biblical proverbs are supremely  practical and teach us how to live wisely.<br><br>Over the next weeks,  well spend some time learning about what it means to be wise, but  always in the practical context of our daily life. <br><br><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Take a  few minutes and ask God for wisdom in any area you feel a lack of  clarity. (He has promised that if we ask for it, he will give it to us.) <br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK </strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%201:5&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 1:5</a></p>
