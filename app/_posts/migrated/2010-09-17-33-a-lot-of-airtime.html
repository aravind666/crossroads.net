<p class="normal noPspace">Rock star Bono, in his address at the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-02-bono-transcript_x.htm" target="_blank">National Prayer Breakfast</a>, called out that its not a coincidence that in  the Scriptures, poverty is mentioned more than 2100 times.thats a lot of airtime</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">In Richard Stearns recent book, <a href="http://www.theholeinourgospel.com/" target="_blank">The Hole in Our Gospel</a>, the World Vision CEO points readers to a passage  in the Bible (Luke 4) where Jesus unrolls the scroll of the prophet Isaiah and states  that the Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach  good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind,  to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lords favor. Isnt it interesting that the first recipients of this gospel are the poor? Stearns challenges  readers with this question: What has the church done to bring good news to the worlds three billion poor?</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Throughout the Bible, Jesus showed us how to tangibly love the poor by his example  of healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked. Perhaps  at Crossroads, youve demonstrated love for the poor in our city by participating in Angel Tree, Go  Cincinnati, Thanksgiving Food Drive, or Whiz Kids. But there is so much more to be done.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Just yesterday,  the US Census Bureau released its <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf" target="_blank">annual report on income, poverty and health insurance in the US</a>. The  latest poverty rate in America is 14.3%, which means that there are more people in poverty in America than ever before. Thats one in  seven, or 44 million Americans, who are living in poverty. the highest number of people in poverty since  the government began keeping track in 1959.</p>
