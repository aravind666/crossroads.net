<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Assists the Team</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week, The Daily will focus on what the Bible says about how men play on a team.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to show you how to be of great assistance to others.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Philippians 2:3-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Assisting is celebrated in many sports---when a player helps or assists another in scoring a point even if that means simply passing the ball. Jesus wants us to do the same, to take a mindset that when we assist or serve others, were contributing to a greater good even when we dont receive the glory. We can do some things on our own, but when we work as a team and assist each other, we can have astounding success.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Assist someone on your team today. Whether its someone in your family, a friend, coworker or even a stranger, give someone a helping hand. Dont expect a certain outcome, but pay attention to what happens because of your assist.</p>
