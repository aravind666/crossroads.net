<p class="noPspace"><strong>Move: Inside Start</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">This week, were looking at the church as a movement, not as an institution. In this passage from Acts, Pauls life teaches us how to move.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001gtMC54GwGFG7Vg0o-tENhXp8sZQ5g2HdG-u1UHVkQTzGp3NVJOWdjoFZmUsv1tbqWw2n4qaRaGINzBWVSufULtyipmAL0w-NcQueRyYrasAxh_VimFKIJ9Qb3M5w2sLfYzABBUdbFiHyWMgkIYzp_St1Mu7dtdrXGH301ZFrM3MuTjiWtdS1mVWUn8REuQMNVV1a4BtCtDVkE-QH33vW-A==" shape="rect" target="_blank">Acts 17:16-17</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong>Pauls missions have taken him to Athens. When he arrives, he surveys the area and his heart begins to ache for the many idols that he sees. God is about to do something cool through Paul.Not long before, Paul was highly persecuting Christians--even murdering them. He may not have worshipped the kind of idols that he sees in Athens, but he was clearly a prideful worshipper of rules and a murderer, until he encountered Jesus.</p>

<p class="noPspace">When our hearts break for something or someone, the way Paul shows distress for Athens, it doesnt come from a place of judgment. It comes from knowing how much God has freed us, and making the connection that he wants to do the same for someone else.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Take a moment and recall to mind your worst moment. A moment when you were the worst version of yourself. Then, survey your community: where you work, live, go to school, hang out. Let God move you to "distress" for people in your life who might be feeling that same kind of brokenness.</p>
