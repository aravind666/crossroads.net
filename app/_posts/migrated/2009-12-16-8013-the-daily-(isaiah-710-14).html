<strong>Wednesday, December 16</strong><br>God With Us<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Isaiah 7:10-14<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>In the midst of hard times, it can be difficult to believe that God is with us. Not just that He is around, aware, or watching, but that he is actually with us. <br><br>Hundreds of years before Jesus birth, a king named Ahaz was struggling to believe that God would keep his promises. So God sent a messenger named Isaiah to tell Ahaz about another sign that God was keeping his worda virgin would give birth to a son who would be Gods promised savior.<br><br>Virgins dont generally have children. But when God is actually with us, things happen that wouldnt otherwise.<br><br>Lives are changed. Promises are fulfilled. The sick are healed, the dead come back to life, and virgins have children.<br><ul>
<li>Does anything make it hard for you to believe that God is with you?</li>
<li>What would change for you, today, if you were convinced that God was with you?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Choose one of the ways that you struggle to believe that God is with you. Write a letter to God about why you feel this way, and how your life/outlook would be different if this struggle didnt exist. Then, ask Him to show you that he is with you in some tangible way you can understand.<br><br><br><strong>Another Look:</strong><br>Exodus 33:12-17<br><br><em>If you are new to The Daily, <a style="color: #3a6e8f; text-decoration: none" href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.</em>
