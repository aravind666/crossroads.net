<p>Moving Beyond Impossible</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Ask God to help you see past whats "possible" today.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Do  you ever have those moments in life where you look back and say, "I  wish that had turned out differently," or maybe "I wonder what my life  would be like if this had happened."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Abram  is the poster child for that kind of "missed opportunity." Hes 75  years old, has a meager set of flocks (the measure of financial  success), and no children (the sign of social success).</p>
<p></p>
<p>By all accounts, his life simply hasnt amounted to much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And  it is in this moment that God comes to him and says, in essence: "I  have something new for you. All of those things that you thought had  passed you by? Im bringing all that stuff starting now--all you have to  do is follow me and trust that it isnt impossible."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What  disappointments or missed expectations from the past still haunt you?  If we learn anything from the story of Abraham, its that it is never  too late for God to make something miraculous out of the "impossible."  Take a few minutes and sit quietly with God, and ask him to show you a  glimpse of what he wants to do with your life right now.</p>
