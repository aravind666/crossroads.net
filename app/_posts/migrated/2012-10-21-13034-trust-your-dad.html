<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">How much time do you spend everyday leaning on your own understanding? A good way to know the answer to that question is to ask yourself, "How far am I going into my day before I ask God what he has for me that day?" When you start your day acknowledging your Dad, like thanking him or pointing out where he is at work in your life, you can hear more clearly what he has for you. This week, try starting each day acknowledging your Dad, and then notice if your path doesnt become clearer.</p>
