<p class="noPspace"><strong>Real Relationships</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">As weve learned about sharing our faith over the past few weeks, "relationships" has emerged as one of the main themes. Telling others about the good news of Jesus often happens best in the context of a close, trusting relationship. This week, well study interactions between Jesus and his disciple Peter, discovering what we can from their boldly authentic friendship. (Heads up: youll also see Peter referred to as Simon and Simon Peter. Theyre all the same guy.)</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>This relationship began with invitation. Jesus met Peter exactly where he was: at his job, and as a self-proclaimed "sinful man." He didnt wait for Peter to fix his unhealthy habits, or make him fill out an official disciple application form. Jesus simply invited Peter into his life.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Do you find yourself identifying more with Jesus or with Peter in todays passage? Are you typically the inviter or the invitee when it comes to a new friendship? Today, ask God to reveal something new to you about how you approach relationships.</p>
