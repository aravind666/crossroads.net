<p>Mark the Remarkable</p>

<p><em>God, remind me of your power, presence and goodness in my life.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>God  called Joshua and the Israelites to do something remarkable, even  impossible. Basically, God told them to "take the Promised Land from the  big scary giant people. To get there, cross the Jordan River, which  happens to be at flood stage. When you step into the water, the river  will stop flowing and you will cross on dry land. Do exactly what I say.  Trust me." And they did. And God showed up, just like he said he would.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After  God showed up in a big way, he led the Israelites through the process  of setting up a memorial. Even today, God wants his miracles known and  celebrated. He wants his story told. And notice how He wants to be  involved not just in how the miracles happen, but also in how they are  celebrated.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  a time in your life when God did something remarkable. Maybe He healed a  loved one, or gave you a child you thought you couldnt have. Maybe He  asked you to do something terrifying, but you did it anyway. Today thank  Him for that miracle, ask him what kind of memorial he would like for  the miracle, and then create it. Maybe plant a tree, or make a garden  stone as a family. It doesnt have to be big or fancy, just something  that sparks the re-telling of the story - "This is to remember the day  that God did this in my life."</p>
