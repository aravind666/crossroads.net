<img src="../images/uploadedImages/iam90x90.jpg" alt="I Am" hspace="5" width="90" height="90" align="right" />This past weekend was the first week in our new &quot;<a href="../my/media/messages.php">I AM...</a>&quot; series. We're examining the life of Jesus and seeing what it looks like to live a life that's centered around a mission. This past weekend, we saw that when Jesus heard from God, he <em>bent his life</em> to that truth. We also learned about how temptations and intentions are not what's important, but action. <br /><br />In case you missed the service, you can <a href="../my/media/playVideo.php?idMedia=578">watch</a> or <a href="../my/media/playMedia.php?idMedia=579">listen to</a> the talk. Also, here are last weekend's <a href="../images/uploadedImages/Study-Notes-4.6.2008.pdf">Study Notes</a> (PDF) and <a href="../images/uploadedImages/0405_06Program.pdf">Program</a> (PDF).<br /><br />This coming weekend, Chuck Mingo will be talking about how Jesus engaged other people in his life.
