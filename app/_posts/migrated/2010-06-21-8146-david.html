<p><strong>Week 2: A Life of Adventure</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, June 21 </strong><br> David</p>
<p></p>
<p>This week well look at a few peoples stories (both from biblical times and more recently) that represent the adventure of following Jesus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spend a minute asking God to reveal his adventure to you and to fill you with boldness.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%2017:34-37&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Samuel%2017:45-50&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">45-50</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>How many of us have heard the biblical account of David and Goliath, but never read it for ourselves? Its a story that can make your heart beat fast as read about a young kid who courageously stares down a huge man in the midst of a war. Yet in the standoff, David is very clear where his power and strength come from: "the battle is the Lords, and he will deliver you [Goliath] into our hands."</p>
<p></p>
<p>David was a man as passionate about God as any whove walked on this earth, and his story also reveals a man who knew adventure. From killing a giant to slaying tens of thousands and being king of a nation, David lived a life focused on God, and it was filled with grand adventure. At the same time, David was a normal guy who wrestled with the same temptations we do. From an adulterous affair to disobeying the Lord, he made a mess of things more than once. But until the day he died, he never lost track of who owned his life and his allegiance. His life is a testament to the adventure available to those who follow God with reckless abandon.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever thought that passionately pursuing God meant following him perfectly? Does Davids life give you any personal context for following God into the unknown, and releasing an expectation that everything will go perfectly?</p>
