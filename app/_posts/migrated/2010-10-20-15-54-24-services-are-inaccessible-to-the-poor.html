<p class="normal noPspace">One of the most  compelling reasons behind the creation of CityLink Center is very clear:  people without access to reliable transportation cannot possibly  address all of the other areas of their life where they are lacking  resources.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Have you ever spent  most of the day running errands?</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Ikea and get the bookcase you saw online.</li>
<li>Pick up a prescription at the pharmacy.</li>
<li>Stock up at the grocery store (You&rsquo;ve got space in your pantry.).</li>
<li>Hit the gym and get in a quick workout.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal noPspace">Most likely, you zipped from place to  place easily with resources to pay for each stop. At the end of the day,  you&rsquo;re exhausted but happy that you&rsquo;ve accomplished so many  non-essential but still-have-to-get-done tasks. Life is now organized  and you can kick back and relax.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">But what if your to do list that day  looked like this?</p>
<ul><li>Drop off your tenth application in  three years to the McDonald&rsquo;s closest to your home (It&rsquo;s two bus  transfers away, but you haven&rsquo;t worked in five years.).</li>
<li>Go to Super Jobs to  ask again about the job you really want but don&rsquo;t have the training for  (You&rsquo;re hoping they&rsquo;ve changed the requirements).</li>
<li>Find a free babysitter  so that you can attend a GED class at Cincinnati State (You&rsquo;ve missed  three classes already, one more and you&rsquo;ll have to start over.).</li>
<li>Borrow money from your  mother who lives in Dayton, Ohio, so that you can take your rent to  your landlord who lives in the East End.</li>
<li>Get the baby to the  free clinic for the cough that won&rsquo;t go away.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal noPspace">Hard? No, impossible.  Without a car or someone to take you place to place, it&rsquo;s impossible to  navigate this list of essential and must-be-done tasks in a day. The  baby is sick and hungry, you have no money and no job. Everyone you know  is in exactly the same situation, so there is no one to help you. It&rsquo;s  so easy to give up.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">At CityLink Center, crucial services  like job training, GED classes, financial skill-building and health care  will all happen under one roof. One stop. That&rsquo;s possible. That&rsquo;s hope.  One by one, we&rsquo;ll help  people build up resources while walking along side them through job  coaching and mentoring. One by one, we&rsquo;ll break the cycle of  generational poverty in families.</p>
