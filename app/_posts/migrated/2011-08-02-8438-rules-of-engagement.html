<p>Rules of Engagement</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, teach me more about your presence and power.</em></p>

<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Regardless  of our church background or lack thereof, its easy for us to fall into  a thought pattern of the way things ought to be. The same was true for  Joshua.It wasnt that he wanted the men to stop because they were  saying anything wrong; rather, Joshua was concerned they were breaking  rules by doing holy things outside of the place that was established for  them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The  truth is that God can and will show up anytime, anywhere, to anyone.  Like Joshua, we can learn from Moses, who insists that receiving God  outside of the box is a good thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Are  you sometimes distracted by rules of when and where God can show up?  For example, you might think He only speaks through a pastor on Sunday  morning, or through a devotional you receive daily in your inbox.  But God wants to speak to you all the time, in both expected and  unexpected places. Today, ask God to reveal himself to you in a new way.  Look and listen for Him in unexpected places.</p>
