<p class="noPspace"><strong>Listen: Know the Voice</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">We continue to study listening as part of an active faith.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:27&amp;version=TNIV">John 10:27</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Jesus calls Himself the Good Shepherd, because he is willing to lay down His life for His sheep. He doesnt want to sway and influence for His own benefit, like a hired hand only in it for the pay. Jesus knows us, loves us, and cares for us deeply. How often do we let ourselves be led by voices that do not have that same love and care as their motivation? We are wooed by seducing ads, influential voices, hip trends, or our own self-focused gain--none of which have any desire to care or love, but instead to sell and self-serve.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">How do you train to know the voice of someone? You listen. Spend 10-20 minutes today just listening, and if you arent that good at sitting (or walking) and listening, try reading anywhere in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+1&amp;version=NIV">Psalms</a>. When we read the Bible, its good to just sit at our Dads feet and hear his voice.</p>

<p class="noPspace">READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>
<p class="noPspace">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20thessalonians%201&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">2 Thessalonians 1</a></p>
