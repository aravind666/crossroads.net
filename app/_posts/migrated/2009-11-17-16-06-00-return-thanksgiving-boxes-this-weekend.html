<strong>All Thanksgiving Food Drive boxes need to be returned this weekend.</strong> Drop-off weekend is always a lot of fun, and can be a little chaotic. Please remember:<br><ul>
<li>Shop early! Although we've done our best to prepare local stores for the demand created by our food drive, there's always the possibility that you'll have trouble finding items if you wait until the last minute. Remember, a family is counting on you.</li>
<li>Due to strict import/export laws for boxes headed to South Africa, we can't have deviations. Please purchase only the exact items and quantities listed on the sticker you received with your box. (Please note: Meijer gave us the heads up that they won't be able to stock as much rice as they'd hoped. So, again, please shop early.)</li>
<li>If you picked up a box at Crossroads Oakley, return it to the Oakley Annex parking lot on <strong>Saturday, November 21 between 3-8pm</strong> (best drop-off time) or <strong>Sunday, November 22 between 7:30am-noon</strong>. If you picked up a box at Crossroads Mason, return it to the rear parking lot of Mason Middle School on <strong>Sunday, November 22 between 8:30am-12:30pm</strong>.</li>
<li>Return products in the cardboard box we provided to you. Please tape the bottom of your box to support the weight. Do not tape the top.</li>
</ul>Â </body></html>
