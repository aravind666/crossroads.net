<p class="noPspace">As we move forward in South Africa, we intend to partner with secular organizations who can bring expertise and resources to the table. We just had tremendous success working with Luxottica/ OneSight, and now, as I write this, three students from the University of Cincinnati Pharmacy School are spending three weeks working at our clinic in Mamelodi as one of their official rotations for school.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The three pioneers, Justin, Jordan and Jeff, are doing a bunch of research to ensure that we are in complete compliance with South African drug laws. They&rsquo;re also spending time at local pharmacies to learn the ins and outs of the drug business in South Africa, doing training for the Bophelong Hospice employees on diabetes monitoring and management, working on an inventory system for the Bophelong pharmacy, and spending time going on home visits with the home-based care workers.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">This is just the first in what we hope to be a long line of student rotations, not just from the UC Pharmacy School but from other medical, dental, optometry and pharmacy schools around the world, that will bring expertise to our South Africa partnership while providing the students with invaluable experience working with those living in extreme poverty.</p>
