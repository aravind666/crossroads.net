<img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/Corporate Blogger/thanksgiving.gif\" alt=\"Thanksgiving\" title=\"Thanksgiving\" width=\"135\" height=\"135\" align=\"right\" />Here's hoping that everyone has a great Thanksgiving Day tomorrow.
Please note that the building will be closed tomorrow and Friday for
the Thanksgiving holiday. Join us this weekend, though, as we close our
<a href=\"../my/media/messages.php\" title=\"Context Messages\">Context series</a>
by sharing stories from Crossroads' history and hearing how regular
folks in our community are living out the vision of this place.
