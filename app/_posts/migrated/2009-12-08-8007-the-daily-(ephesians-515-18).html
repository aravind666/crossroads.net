True Wisdom<br><br><em>Take a moment to pray and ask God to meet you during this time.</em><br><br>
<strong>READ</strong><br>Ephesians 5:15-18<br><br>
<strong>REFLECT</strong><br>
Wisdom. Its a word that might conjure up images of white-haired old guys doling out fortune cookie-type statements (think Mr. Miyagi or the guy from the yellowbook.com commercials). Wisdom is supposed to be deep, meaningful, meditative and serene, right?  In other words, it feels like having a real life with a real schedule and real problems puts wisdom out of our reach.Yet Paul indicates something entirely different. He doesnt really offer much that we would consider deep or thoughtful, just encouragement to make the best use possible of our time, and to be filled with Gods Spirit.  Paul is calling us to be strategic about the way we live our lives. <br>What might this kind of wisdom mean<br>for:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>The way you use your free time?</li>
<li>The way you approach your relationships?</li>
<li>Your outlook on your job?</li>
</ul>
<strong><br>RESPOND</strong><br>While its important to be strategic about our lives, we must not forget that the<br>foundation of true wisdom is our connection with Gods Spirit. In fact, it says<br>in James 1:5 that if we need wisdom, we should ask God and he will give it to<br>us. Take the rest of your time with God today to ask him to make you wise in<br>the various areas of your life. If He brings things to your mind, write them<br>down in your journal.<br><br>
