<p class="noPspace"><strong>The Paralytic Healed: Believe and Act</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace">Frequently in the Bible, someone asks to be healed, and Jesus commends their faith and heals them. Jesus acts unexpectedly in this story because the faith moment happensafterthe healing. The paralytic man is given a moment where he can, in faith, agree with his healing. Look for it.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>The man had to first believe that he was cured, then act on that belief. (If you had never walked, can you imagine how hard it would be to believe that you suddenly could?) In this case, the man took the simple-but-hard steps of agreeing that he was healed, then getting up and walking.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong></strong>Today, ask God to help you believe in the impossible. Ask Him what taking steps in that direction might look like.</p>
