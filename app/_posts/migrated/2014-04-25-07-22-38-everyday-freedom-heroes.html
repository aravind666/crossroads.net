<p class="noPspace">Kerry and Annie Hilton moved their family from New Zealand to Kolkata, India, to live among the poor. Kerry took a walk at night and realized they had moved into the largest red light district in India. They had not planned on putting themselves or their four children amidst a massive, active commercial sex industry. They easily could have chosen the “safe” route—to find a better neighborhood. But instead, they stayed and took the time to get to know their neighbors. Two years later, they met with a group of 20 women to begin what we know today as Freeset, a business for freedom.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> <br class="pagebreak"></p>
<p class="noPspace">The Hiltons created a company to primarily serve the needs of its employees, rather than select the best employees to produce a profit. With employment criteria being need-based instead of ability-based, they turned business on its head. The economics of what they produce is essential to their success, but their workers are not the most obvious choice of business partners.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Freeset is the Hiltons’ solution to giving women a viable job option to the sex trade. They identified the problem as economic and began to create an alternative. A community formed as the Hiltons invited women to build a business that produces export-quality custom bags and organic cotton t-shirts. Now 200 women are working for wages at the industry standard, with a pension, child care and health care. Dignity and freedom come with the job, making Freeset the ultimate package.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">With 10,000 sex workers in a few square miles in Kolkata, Freeset has already given two percent of the women another way of life. This two percent is working in a sustainable industry and learning valuable skills. Although Freeset will continue to grow, it will not be able to accommodate 10,000. In response, the Hiltons have created a replicable model others can use to start businesses in India.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">They are now building into entrepreneurs who will expand the scope of job opportunities for other at-risk populations. They are sharing what they have developed over the past 13 years to spark widespread, long-term, kingdom-inspired freedom through the “Freeset Incubator.”</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">The Hiltons were recently honored at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center as “Everyday Freedom Heroes” for their outstanding work and commitment to freedom. Fair trade business not only offers a choice to employees but to consumers. As they choose daily how to manage their business, we can consider the impact of our everyday choices.</p>
