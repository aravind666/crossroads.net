Brian Tome recently taught at our weekly Staff Training about big-picture changes he sees happening in culture. His teaching preceded a time of &quot;big prayer&quot; in which our staff prayed for big, seemingly impossible things that we'd like to see God do in our city, country and world. <br /><br /><strong>Since we're all one team around here</strong> (paid staff + unpaid staff who happen to get their paychecks somewhere else), we thought we'd make this teaching available to the whole team. Enjoy.<br /><br /><a href="../images/uploadedImages/staff-training-040109.mp3">Brian Tome at Staff Training</a> (mp3)<br /><span class="dim">To save the file to your computer: If you're using a
