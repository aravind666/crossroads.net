<p>Easter is this weekend. Remember, there's an extra service in Oakley on Saturday at 3pm. All other service times remain the same at both locations. If you live in or near Mason, we strongly encourage you to attend Crossroads Mason on Easter. This will leave more room for guests checking out Crossroads this weekend.</p>
