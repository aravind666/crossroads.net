<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Comfort for Us All</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">This week weve explored what we can do when we are suffering or when we see trouble coming.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to share his comfort with you.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:18</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A3-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">When we suffer, its hard to feel like God is right there with us. It can be a really lonely place. But Hes there. He may not intercede, but hes teaching us, preparing us for something new, and caring for us. Sometimes, no matter what our affliction might be, the most important thing we can do is lean in to His comfort. That way, when our friends, family, and neighbors need it, we can give them comfort and a place to heal.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Think about someone you know who is suffering or in trouble. Who comes to mind? Spend some time praying for them. Then, go be with them and give them comfort.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">2 Corinthians 13</a></p>
