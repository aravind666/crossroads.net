<p><strong>Week One: Prayer</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, April 25 </strong></p>
<p>Prayer</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, help me identify and tear down the walls I put up around prayer. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:5-14&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 6:5-14</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>We can get hung up on prayer. Maybe it seems hard, intimidating, pointless, or even just too simple. Maybe we feel guilted into prayer. Or maybe its an incredible part of our days. </p>
<p><em>We today yearn for prayer and hide from prayer. We are attracted to it and repelled by it. We believe prayer is something we should do, even something we want to do, but it seems like a chasm stands between us and actually praying. (Richard Foster, Prayer)</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the next two weeks well look at some experiences people in scripture had with prayer, and then what Jesus says about having intimate conversations with God. Hopefully, along the way, well shed some of our own barriers around prayer and have conversations with God in a new, dynamic way.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Spend a few minutes making a list of anything that comes between you and talking to God. (Time? Ambivalence? Too much formality? Not enough? An old hurt?) Keep this list and check back with it these next two weeks, and take note of anything you hear God saying about those barriers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
