<p>Embracing the tension of purpose</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%204:1-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 4:1-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Unlike much of the worlds population, most of us have easy, reliable access to high quality food, medicine, clean water and secure shelter. Very few of us have to live a hand-to-mouth, subsistence lifestyle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But if its so easy to meet our basic needs, then why do many of us work ourselves into fits of stress and tension? Todays reading gives us some ideas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solomon notes envy, vanity and "a chasing after wind." Considering that biblical scholars date Ecclesiastes to somewhere between the tenth and third centuries B.C., its clear that these are long-held human vices. Our ancestors, and their ancestors before them, likely struggled with separating their unique purposes in this world with vanity and envy-induced distractions, the winds to which Solomon refers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Embracing the reality of this earthly human tendency makes it clear that we need to distinguish true purpose from pointless pursuits. And thankfully, God gives us a powerful tool for this very job: prayer, and the sense of quiet-minded peace and clarity it can bring to our lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Compose your own personal prayer asking for clarity of mind, and for Gods direction in helping you identify your true purpose. Dont worry about complexity. Just be honest and to the point. Consider memorizing it for the moments when you are tempted to chase the wind.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT<br></strong>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 8</a></p>
