<p>Words Bring Salvation</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please continue to purify my heart so that my words bear good fruit.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Were  learning that our mouth bears the fruit of whats in our heart. Paul  spells out for us that the recipe for salvation is simple. Its one part  heart (our heart chooses to believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of  God), and one part mouth (we confess aloud what our heart has decided).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Consider  the partnership between the heart and mouth. How much is in your heart  that youve never spoken aloud? About others, about yourself, about God?  As you go through your day, SPEAK ALOUD to God what you think of him.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
