<p>Embracing the tension of submission</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please help me trust that even though life sometimes feels uncertain, the changes and challenges that occur in my life are all part of something much bigger, a plan youve made that goes beyond what I can see or comprehend.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%208:1-6&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ecclesiastes 8:1-6</a></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This is a tricky one. How do we compel ourselves to submit to higher authority, even when it seems that doing so runs against our hunches or desires? Its a difficult directive, indeed, to submit to someone elses direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Solomon makes a powerful point when he refers not to mortal kings, but to the King over everything: its not always easy submitting to Gods will, but submission to the wisest of wise, the highest of all powers, is the only way to find our true missions and purpose in this life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Submitting to authority, whether its a teacher, a boss, a leader or even Gods will, isnt easy. The next time youre faced with the tension of having to submit to anothers authority, think about that persons or institutions perspective: can he or she see more about a situation than you can, information that could lead to a wiser decision? Does considering this make it easier to go along with the leaders direction?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT </strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 13</a></p>
