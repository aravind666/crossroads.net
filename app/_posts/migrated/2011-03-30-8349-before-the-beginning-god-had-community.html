<p>Before the Beginning: God had Community</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, thank you for inviting me into your loving community.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:20-24&amp;version=NIV">John 17:20-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Jesus says that God loved him before the creation of the world. This means that God existed in a loving community long before he created man. In our me-focused, consumer culture we can sometimes think that God created people because he was lonely. According to the words of Jesus, God doesnt invite us into community with him because he is lonely, but because he is generous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Think about when you experience something amazingwhether its a film, a new restaurant or a drive off the beaten path. In the midst of those kinds of experiences, inevitably you start to think about how you wish other people you care about (a spouse, a friend, your kids) could experience the same thing. This is why God invites us into relationship with him. Hes part of a community where we can experience perfect love. A community that has been together before the world ever began.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>God continually invites you to experience the reality of community with him. Are you availing yourself to His constant companionship?</p>
