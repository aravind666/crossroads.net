<p><strong>Wednesday, February 3<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Religion or Relationship</span></strong></p>
<p><em> Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%203:1-9&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 3:1-9<br></a><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">(Click to view the scripture online.)</span><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">The wonder and power of Gods Spirit (i.e. the Holy Spirit, or the third person in the Trinity) can only come from faith in Jesus. But we can fall into the trap of believing God expects us to be saintly rule keepers. While this seems to be a noble effort, a focus on performance eventually leads to judgment of others, arrogance, isolation and an entitlement mentality towards God. This is what religion does to us, and is why Paul calls his community foolish and bewitched: they tried to take matters into their own hands. They forgot the truth they heard Jesus speak.</span></strong></p>
<p>Paul seems to be making a connection between the Spirit and avoiding the trap of religion. Read the above scripture again, taking note of the references made to the Spirit.</p>
<ul>
<li>How could the Spirit keep us from the trap of religion?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">God puts his Spirit inside every person who believes in Jesus resurrection from death, and the Spirits role is to transform us, grow us, and guide us in our relationship with God. Ask God to fill you with his Spirit right now.</span></strong></p>
