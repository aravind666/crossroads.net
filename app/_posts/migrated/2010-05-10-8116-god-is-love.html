<p>God is Love</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal himself to you as you study His nature.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20John%204:7-12&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 John 4:7-12</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Romans%205:6-8&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Romans 5:6-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Love is a tricky idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its possible that many of us dont have a concept of real love because the word is thrown around so casually. We say we love cars, a new girlfriend, a TV series. This doesnt exactly set the stage for taking love seriously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At a deeper level, and more significantly, were taught (and shown) that love is situational or conditional. The world teaches us that the love we receive or deserve is based on what we provide, what we do, or how we live.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need to look at the source of love to really begin understanding what it means and how we can both receive and reflect it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why might it be difficult to accept the unconditional love of God?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND </strong></p>
<p>Consider a time when you offered someone love when they didnt necessarily deserve it. (Often, other people will criticize you when you do this, or make you feel like youre giving in.) What gave you the strength to offer this love?</p>
