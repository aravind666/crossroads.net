<p>The Fullness of Freedom</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20Corinthians%207:21-23&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">1 Corinthians 7:21-23</a><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Weve discussed how were all tied to something. The question is, whos pulling the strings? Is it someone (or something) that puts us in bondage, or is it someone whos fighting for our freedom?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember: Jesus has paid the price for your freedom. You can experience the fullness of freedom only when youre attached to Him.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>If youve never attached yourself to Jesus, you can do that now. Simply tell God you realize you cant earn your own freedom, and that want to receive what hes done for you through Jesus. If youve already chosen to follow Jesus, tell God youre grateful for what hes done, and ask him to bring you into increasing amounts of freedom in your life.</p>
