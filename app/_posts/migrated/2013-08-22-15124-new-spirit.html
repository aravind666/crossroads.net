<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>New: Spirit</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">There is a consistent pattern in Gods story (the Bible) that makes it seem like he loves the word new. Lets continue checking that out.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2011:19-20&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Ezekiel 11:19</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ezekiel is a prophetic book where God communicates with his people like they are truly his bride. He married himself through a covenant to them long before, and he wants them to be faithful. Not because He is a controlling husband, but because he adores them.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants a loving covenant with you. Hes all in, and marriages and healthy relationships are not filled with rules for the sake of rules. They are dynamic and growing, filled with rhythms and learnings, grace and challenges, and God wants all of the mystery and beauty of that with you.</p>
