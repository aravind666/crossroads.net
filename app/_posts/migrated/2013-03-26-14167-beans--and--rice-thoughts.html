<p class="noPspace">Im a little more than 24 hours into my beans and rice weeklong diet and have been reminded of some things that others may profit to hear. While this isnt a challenge to be hungry for a week, it is a sort of fast. The prophet Daniel had a form of a fast when he abstained from the normal food of his day and had only vegetables to eat and water to drink.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We are having a form of a fast in eating more rice and beans than normal, so we can identify with billions in our world that only eat that sort of meal their entire lives. In the process we are saving money from our normal food bill (prepackaged foods, restaurant tabs, higher end groceries, etc) in order to redirect it toward investments that we want to see flourish. Here are some things Im thinking as Im fasting:</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br class="pagebreak"></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Every thought I have regarding my different diet is a reminder to pray. I am praying for hungry children across the globe, families in our city who need to have fun at a city pool and children in our city who need a helpful nudge in the right direction through a pre-school scholarship.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.75;">When I do feel a grumble in my stomach I ask myself and God, Do I hunger more for You or pizza and beer?</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.75;">When Im uncomfortable, I realize that God is sustaining me and I pray that He is sustaining others who are going through discomfort and pain as a normal course of life.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Prayer is most powerful when multiple people are agreeing (Matthew 18:19). Our redemptive potential is extremely powerful at this moment. This week Im spending time thanking God for the community He has allowed me to be a part of that is united and moving forward under His leadership.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Whether you are fasting from normal food or fasting from normal entertainment expenditures or other normal spending patterns, lets lean into God and into each other and get done what He wants done. In the process His greatest work may be the work He does in us.</span></p>
