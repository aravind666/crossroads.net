<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Kingdom Come: David</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today, David tells a story about his neighbors change of heart.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>DAVIDS STORY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our street has a block party where we get neighbor signatures to block the street from traffic. One neighbor refused to sign. I decided I needed to go have a conversation with said neighbor, something I was NOT excited about.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">I prayed God would go before me, that whatever happened He would be involved. I timidly knocked on the door and waited. Finally the neighbor answered and we decided to have a seat on the front porch and talk. After 15 minutes of good conversation, getting to know each other, understanding each others position, and me feeling like I was able to extend her grace and love...she signed her name on the list.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">With the party in full swing, this neighbor and her husband walked by (not joining the party). I walked up to her to simply say thanks. As I approached, she smiled and gave me a hug!....A HUG! I feel like I saw the Kingdom right there in that moment....and it was good.</p>
