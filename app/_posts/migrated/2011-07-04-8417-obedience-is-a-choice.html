<p><strong>Week One: Obedience</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday, July 4</strong></p>
<p>Obedience is a Choice</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, make me mindful of the choices I make, and let me be obedient to your word.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%202:16-17&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Genesis 2:16-17</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Gods instruction was pretty clear do not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Here comes the SPOILER ALERT: Adam and Eve do eat the fruit, put on fig-leaf outfits, and are banned from the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe life would have been a little easier if God had not put that tree in the garden, or if God had forced Adam and Eve to follow the rules. But He didnt. God didnt desire us to be his little human puppets. He wanted, and still wants, to have a real relationship with us. And that means that we have the opportunity to freely choose Him, or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the next two weeks, were exploring the subject of obedience. Obedience is choosing to listen to Gods voice, and then following through because we trust that his way is best.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>God wants to have a personal relationship with each of us. We dont have to be perfect, and we will all stumble along the way. Take some time this week to reflect on the decisions you make, even the small ones. How often do you ask God to weigh in on those decisions? How often do you obey Him? How often do you eat the fruit anyway?</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT </strong></p>
