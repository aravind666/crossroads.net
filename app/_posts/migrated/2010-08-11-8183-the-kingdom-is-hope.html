<p>The Kingdom is Hope</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>Take a moment and ask God to fill you (or perhaps refill you) with hope.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Hebrews%2010:23-24&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Hebrews 10:23-24</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>The Kingdom is a present and coming reality; it has already begun, but it is not yet completed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scripture today reminds us that if we say yes to Jesus, were also saying yes to hope. In fact, one of our roles as followers of Jesus is to spur one another on, that is, to encourage others to live in the present reality with an unswerving hope for the consummation of the Kingdom that is yet to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>What can you do today to spur someone toward hope? It could be a simple word of encouragement, or a silent prayer on behalf of someone going through a tough time. Maybe its your willingness to hold on to hope as you face your own suffering and difficulties.</p>
<p></p>
