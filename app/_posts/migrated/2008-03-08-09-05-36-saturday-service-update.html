<html><body><p>Hamilton, Kenton and Butler counties are currently under a Level 3 snow emergency. This means that road travel is not allowed except in the case of an emergency.<br><br>This is uncharted territory for us. In the twelve years we've been around, we've never had to cancel services due to weather. As long as the roads were reasonably passable (and it's not illegal to be on them), all has proceeded as planned.<br><br>Napolean had his Waterloo, Custer had his Last Stand, and now Crossroads has 3/8/08.<br><br><strong>Saturday Night Services are canceled.</strong> <br><br>Sunday will go on as planned. (Make sure to change your clocks tonight so you're not late!)<br> </p></body></html>
