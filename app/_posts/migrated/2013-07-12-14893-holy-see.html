<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Holy: See</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Today we continue to look at how different God is from us. We are sticking with the same passage, but dont just skip over it if you read it yesterday, let it sink in a little deeper each day.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:29-30&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Romans 8:29-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you put your focus on the first half of the passage today, its all about Jesus. Jesus is both fully God and fully human. Good leaders show by modeling, and God came into the day-in-day-out life of humanity to model how to live holy lives. Jesus models holiness for us, but he does even more. Jesus invites us to connect with a holy and perfect God--even though we are not. He laid down his life as the path.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print">John 14:6</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Matthew 14</a></p>
