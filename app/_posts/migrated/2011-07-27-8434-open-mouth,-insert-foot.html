<p>Open Mouth, Insert Foot</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, please give me more self-discipline, and help me control what I say.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:7&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Proverbs 18:7</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Weve  learned that our tongues are inherently evil. They insult, gossip, and  crush spirits. They offer biting sarcasm veiled as a joke. They forego  integrity for selfish ambition and lies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But  our tongues dont just hurt others; they hurt us as well. With their  lack of self-control and compassion, our tongues can betray us and make  us look like fools. And were often our own worst critics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Im so stupid. I look like crap. Im such a failure."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do we find it so easy to agree with the accusers lies, instead of the truth of our Creator?</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Remember  Stuart Smalley? "Im good enough, Im smart enough, and, gosh darnit,  people like me." Well, Stuart was actually on to something. Today, stop  speaking harshly to yourself. Ask God what he thinks of you. And speak  out loud the good stuff He tells you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>READ THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>Todays reading is: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Luke 11</a></p>
