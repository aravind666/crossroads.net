<p><strong>Week 1: Game Change</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>Monday, October 11</strong></p>
<p>Game Change</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>During Game Change, The Daily will serve the role of encourager during the spiritual journey we began this weekend at Crossroads. Well start with a heads up about whats happening this week and spend the next few days revisiting important ideas from the weekend message.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Game Change Documentary Screening: Youre invited to come check out a short film about the four initiatives of the campaign: Multi-Site, CityLink, South Africa and India. The film tells the amazing story of how God is working through Crossroads. Show up any night this week at Crossroads Oakley at 7pm in the CSM room. (Childcare is available Monday, Thursday and Friday.) Or go to a screening at the Mason Middle School Auditorium on Tuesday at 7pm. (Sorry, no childcare is available at Mason.)</p>
