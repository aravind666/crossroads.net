<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Use Your Work for Good</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Weve been looking at what the Bible says about work. Today, well look at how one of Jesus followers, Paul, leverages his everyday work with Kingdom work.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018:1-4&amp;version=TNIV&amp;interface=print">Acts 18:1-4</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Paul (one of Jesus apostles) models a life of ministry. He leverages his trade (tentmaking) as a way to network places to stay and work in his trade while he traveled to do ministry. Whether you get a paycheck from a church, corporation or trade, all who follow Jesus are called to a life of ministry.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God how your current job is---and can be---a resource for his purposes.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You can use these questions to spark conversation with others or as writing prompts for journaling.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What do you love about your work now---even if your work is looking for work?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">What, if anything, at your workplace makes it hard to spot the Kingdom? (Stop and pray about those things.)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Have you begun to see your work differently this week? How so?</p>
</li>
</ul>
