<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Thank God for your body (thats right, your arms, toes, liver...) and ask him for healing if you need it.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Heres some good news: God gave you a body and made it just for you. Whether youre in perfect health or experiencing illness, its a gift and a sign of the wealth He has given you. Like all of the wealth we have, we need to take care of it. Some of those things look like eating well and exercising, but others are resting and laughing-out-loud with friends (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456?pg=1">were serious about the laughter</a>). Bottom line, take care of your physical wealth.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Do something today thats an investment in your physical wealth. You could run a mile, take a nap or grab a group of friends and just tell jokes all night. Do something thats good for your body.</p>
