Following the distribution of the new Serve card (pick up yours at the Info Center), tons of new volunteers are already working in Kids' Club, First Impressions and more. And the ones who signed up in time got to enjoy the sweet volunteer party on November 2. Not involved? <a href="../my/serve/index.php" title="Serve at Crossroads">Find out how</a>.
