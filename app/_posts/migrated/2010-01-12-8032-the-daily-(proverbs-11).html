<strong>Tuesday, January 12</strong><br>A Life of Integrity<br><br><em>Spend a minute asking God to help keep your mind and heart open to the things he wants to teach you.</em><br><br><br><strong>READ </strong><br>Proverbs 11<br><br><br><strong>REFLECT</strong><br>There is a term for the type of life that Solomon describes in this chapter - it's called integrity. It's when what we claim to believe matches up with what we do, and it's exactly the kind of life that wise people pursue.<br><br>They treat people fairly, speak with honesty, and live out God's desire for the world, even when it costs them to do so.<br><br>And this is exactly the kind of life God honors.<br><ul>
<li>What situation in your life challenges your integrity? How?</li>
<li>What will you gain if you refuse to give in to that temptation?</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>RESPOND</strong><br>Read back through this chapter and choose one of the proverbs that most connects with whatever challenges your integrity. Spend a couple of minutes memorizing that proverb, and then ask God to help you remember it when you face that temptation.<br><br><br><strong>ANOTHER LOOK</strong><br>James 3:13-17<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">If you are new to The Daily, <a style="color: #3a6e8f; text-decoration: none" href="/about/gettingstarted.htm">click here</a> for tips that will help you get the most out of it.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt"><span>   <br><br></span></span>
