<img src=\"../images/uploadedImages/HospiceConcert2.jpg\" alt=\"Charity &amp; Faith Worship Team Performing\" title=\"Charity &amp; Faith Worship Team\" hspace=\"20\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"right\" />They have landed in the U.S.A.  The Mamelodians were singing through the airport, and they are almost in Cincinnati. They'll stay in our homes as guests for almost two weeks. And this weekend, they'll be singing. Singing and dancing. I can't wait.<br /><br />The Charity &amp; Faith Mission Worship Team will sing at all weekend services, concluding with a special concert Sunday night at 6pm, benefiting the AIDS hospice in Mamelodi. (The concert is free; donations accepted.)  You can read about it here on <a href=\"http&#58;//www.wcpo.com/content/hoc/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WCPO story about Hospice Concert\">wcpo.com.</a>  If you didn't go last year, I'm sure your friends have told you that the concert, and the entire weekend, are not-to-miss. Be sure to wear shoes that can jump.
