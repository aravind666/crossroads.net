<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:19-21&amp;version=MSG&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:19-21</a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">God wants wholeness for you. Wholeness and integration means letting God have access to your whole life. When we try to connect to God, but close our bedroom door assuming we can leave God in the hall, or think that he is not there with us in the bar, at our computer, or anywhere outside of a church building, we begin to feel the force of disintegration.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
