<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This week, well revisit themes from our most recent weekend series, Kingdom Come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In John 18:36, Jesus says that his Kingdom is not of this world. He came to establish a Kingdom that operates in a completely different way than any manmade (worldly) authority structure. In the Kingdom of God, the way to get promoted is to become a servant; the way to gain power is to give power away; and the way to be rich is to give generously. The Kingdom operates in this countercultural way because God is pure love. He has no other motive. And Jesus epitomizes this Kingdom-kind of love by sacrificing his life for ours.</p>
<p><strong><br><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think of a time when you were the recipient of a completely selfless act of love. Chances are, even if you dont regularly see the person who did this act of kindness for you, they still hold a distinct place in your mind. If its feasible, thank this person.</p>
<p></p>
