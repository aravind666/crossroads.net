<p>Prayer of the Humble</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Jesus, help me to hear what you say about prayer, and then help me actually do it.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:%205-8&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 6:5-8</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes its tempting to use prayer as a way to show your spiritual level, or to impress someone around you. But Jesus had a word for that: hypocrites. Certain Jews would stand in public areas making loud, obvious prayers. They thought the louder and more obvious they were, the better it would be. (Kind of like how sometimes we pretend our lives are perfect, when were really feeling like a train wreck.) But Jesus emphasizes that our prayers should be authentic: true to us. So its better to pray to God and be unseen, than to pray in public when your motivation is guided by ego or pretense.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Pray in a new way today. If youre accustomed to praying with others, pray alone. If you typically pray in a closed room, go outside and pray while youre looking around at His creation.</p>
