<p><strong>Tuesday, February 16<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Fruits</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Spend a few minutes asking God to help you apply his truth to your life today.<br><br></em></p>
<p><strong>READ<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Galatians%205:19-26&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">Galatians 5:19-26<br></a>(Click to view the scripture online.)</span></strong></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">You can identify a tree simply by examining the fruit it bears. No one expects an apple tree to sprout oranges.</span></strong></p>
<p>In the same way, Paul tells us that we bear fruit specific to the life we choose to live. If we choose to live according to a sinful nature, we will reap bad fruit. For instance, if we choose impatience over grace, our relationships suffer and our anxiety grows. If, however, we choose to live by the Spirit, we will reap good fruit. So if we follow the Spirits prompting to give grace, then we experience the powerful freedom that comes with generosity.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you see evidence of good fruit in your life right now? It might help to think about specific relationships, your environment, and the areas where you feel peace or hope.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND<br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Write down the fruit of the Spirit you want more of in your life: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness or self-control. Ask God to show you how and when that fruit could reveal itself. Write down any names or actions that come to mind.</span></strong></p>
<p></p>
