<p>Will it Bring Freedom?</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Todays edition of The Daily highlights an important point from this past weekends message for you to keep in mind as you work through your guide and meet with your group this week.</em></p>

<p><strong><br><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>This past weekend, Brian shared one of the primary questions he's been asking himself when faced with a decision: "Will this bring me freedom?" Are you facing any key decisions in your life right now? Try thinking through that decision with the perspective of what will bring you the most freedom, as you now understand it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>PRAY</strong></p>
<p>Ask God to show you places in your life where you are unknowingly putting yourself in bondage.</p>
