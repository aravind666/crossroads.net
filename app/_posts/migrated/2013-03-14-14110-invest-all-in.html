<p class="noPspace">We finish out looking at the investment parable from the book of Matthew that Jesus taught us as a way to understand the way his Kingdom works.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025:14-30&amp;version=MSG">Matthew 25:14-30</a></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This parable as a whole can refocus us on the eternal. Do we trust God and take risks to invest the talents and resources that he has given us? We can focus on the immediate risk of failure or financial stress and the weight of that will swell. Or we can choose to put our focus farther out, in eternity, and know that there is a reward for trusting God and moving.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Thomas Merton wrote a prayer of trust, try praying it today:My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore, will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.</p>
