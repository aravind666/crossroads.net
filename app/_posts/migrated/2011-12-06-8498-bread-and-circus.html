<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>As  Caesar was leading Rome through a time of incredible power and  stability, the underbelly of all that "greatness" was dark. Abusive  taxes, massive exploitation of people, forced slavery. But Caesar knew  how to work the system. "Bread and circus" was his motto: distract the  people with enough food and entertainment and they wont notice the  madness around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This  is the world stage onto which Jesus appeared. The world was hooked on  bread and circus, and this was their measure of peace. But Jesus upended  their system, saying peace would only come to those willing to have  their plans, their ways, their priorities, their thoughts and their  lives interrupted by and submitted to the way of love. And such was the  scandal He created.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Have  you ever felt distracted by something that seemed good at the outset  but turned out to be a false promise (i.e. bread and circus)? Ask God to  help you uproot any current distractions so you can experience his  peace.</p>
