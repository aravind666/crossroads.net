<p class=\"noPspace\">Greetings from Mumbai.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">It&rsquo;s a beautiful Sunday night and some team members and I are sitting outside on a patio, enjoying a beautiful night and reflecting on a great day. The morning broke bright and early (earlier for some folks than others), and the day was filled with worship, eating, and some serious Mumbai style shopping. The team has been in exceptionally good spirits so far, and other than some stubborn jet lag for a few people, everyone has on-boarded to life (and driving) in Mumbai, and seem ready to begin the work we all signed up for months ago.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><br class=\"pagebreak\"></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Prayers are appreciated tomorrow as we spend our first day in one of the homes here in Mumbai. For most of our team it will be the first time they know the names and see the faces of these girls they&rsquo;ve come to love, and one day most certainly won&rsquo;t be enough for them. Please pray the girls receive the love we&rsquo;re bringing, and make meaningful connections with our team members.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">We hope all is well with our families and friends back home. If you&rsquo;d like to leave a message for any one you know on the trip, feel free to address a comment to them following the blog. I&rsquo;ll be sure to get the messages to everyone.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Be on the lookout for Brandon&rsquo;s Day 2 experiences - I heard rumors the \"authentic\" Mumbai shopping experience was stressful to say the least.</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">All our love,</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">Andrew and the team</p><p class=\"noPspace\"><em>In case anyone back home was wondering, God is alive and well in Mumbai.Today we were given the opportunity to worship Indian style at the Living Hope Church a short half hour drive from our hotel. And trust me when I say that half an hour is absolutely a short drive. Upon arriving at the church,we quickly became the object of attention as 22 Americans poured out of our cars on the church steps as the morning Hindi service was just letting out.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>Once our English service began, we soon discovered that despite the lack of air conditioning and rising temperatures, nothing would hold back anyone in the congregation from worshipping their God, and within minutes, the band had us jumping and dancing like no other Church I had seen before. No matter where you&rsquo;ve been born in the world, or where you call home, the love for God is universal. Typically I consider myself to be a somewhat reserved person, but I&rsquo;ll have to admit that soon enough I was unable to contain myself, singing and jumping along with the strangers and newfound friends around me. The service capped off with an awesome and soul-wrenching performance of \"How Deep the Father&rsquo;s Love\", a song that, unknown to the staff of Living Hope, we can recall hearing multiple times during service at Crossroads. Though we are 8,000 miles away, looking around us today at the congregation, at the peoples of many nations coming together as one to praise and rejoice, I had a personal moment that Pastor Andrew Peters has described, and many confirmed, as \"close to what heaven must be like\". Covered in sweat, and singing our hearts out, Living Hope Church gave us a morning that many needed as refreshment before the start of an unquestionably challenging week ahead.</em></p>
<p class=\"noPspace\">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"noPspace\"><em>After service, we were quickly driven off to lunch, and after a short stop at the hotel, we were off again to visit our 2nd shopping market. In a nutshell, Saturday&rsquo;s shopping experience at Colaba market provided everyone with a bit of sensory overload and tough obstacles through bartering, Sunday however, was quite toned down in comparison and gave us all an opportunity to dive into the Indian culture and shop around for our loved ones back home. With the \"days of rest\" now over, Monday waits ahead as we sit on the outdoor patio of our hotel, trading stories of our individual experiences so far. Tomorrow will be huge, our first visit to the aftercare homes. A sense of excitement can be felt throughout our group, we&rsquo;re finally coming to the day we signed up for, the day some have been waiting months for. Though we are not quite sure what exactly to expect, we know that we will absolutely be lead through this experience and become stronger as a whole because of it. I cant wait to see what tomorrow holds, and to be able to live it with the people around me. Mumbai so far has honestly been taxing on the group, but I know that we&rsquo;re gonna make it and we&rsquo;re all going to be in a better place personally no matter what. </em></p>
