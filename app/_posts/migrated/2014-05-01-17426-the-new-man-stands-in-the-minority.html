<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>The New Man Stands in the Minority</strong></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our culture has a lot to say about manhood, but God says something different about it. Over the next few weeks, The Daily will take a look at what the Bible says about manhood.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>PRAY</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Ask God to give you strength in making an unpopular choice.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A30-37&amp;version=NLT&amp;interface=print">Luke 10:30-37</a></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Were comfortable in the middle. It doesnt require us to make decisions. We say, Someone will take care of it. Someone will do it. But thats not what Jesus tells us. He calls men to make the less-than-popular choice. Get involved. Like the parable, its easy to walk by and ignore the choices we need to make. But the Samaritan---a despised character---made a decision. One that would cost him popularity, time and money.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If youve made an unpopular decision recently or you know you have to make one soon, Jesus has something to say to you about it. Invite Him to help you make that decision and trust that His answer is all the strength you need.</p>
