<p class="content">If you haven't signed up to host a small group for Free, the 2010 all-church journey, now is the time. We still need more than 1,000 more hosts so that everyone in our community can participate. If you have a place to meet, some friends or a willingness to find new ones, we need you. It's a 6-week commitment you won't regret.</p>
