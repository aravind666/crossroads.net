<p><strong>Week Two: Characteristics of God</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Monday, May 24</strong></p>
<p>All-Knowing</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Take a moment and ask God to reveal a fuller picture of his character to you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>READ</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>If God were on Facebook, he would never hide your status updates or be surprised by anything you write.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because God knows everything about you, he knows whats going on and how youre feeling in all parts of your life, whether its work, relationships, the team you play on, or your bank account. And He doesnt just know; he cares.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We might have many reactions to this idea: feelings of peace, anxiety, comfort, shame. But we have to keep in mind that God is about our freedom, and nothing short of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>If youre uncomfortable about Gods all-knowing character, consider why. Ask God to help you understand how he can bring you to a place of peace and freedom. Then thank God for caring for us so deeply that he never stops paying attention.</p>
