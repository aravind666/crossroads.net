<p>No Shortcuts</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>God, bring me to a place of peace and contentment as I go through my day.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=James%202:2-4&amp;version=NIV&amp;interface=print">James 2:2-4</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong></p>
<p>When were struggling through the days, or when life feels like its only a series of random events with no purpose, we often want a quick changea moving ahead to the next phase where we hope things are easier, pain-free or more exciting. But what James is encouraging us to do, here, is to see every phase of life as a time for intentional growth. Hes not saying we need to break out the confetti when were suffering, but rather see that time as an opportunity to pull close to God, to grow in our understanding of him, and to become mature in our character.</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>Think back to one difficult situation that, while you wanted out of it desperately at the time, you grew or developed some piece of your character you couldnt do without now. Write or think about that situation, and thank God for the growth that came out of it.</p>
