description: "The Game Change Campaign is focused on making room for friends and neighbors in different parts of Cincinnati to hear about God, tackling poverty in our city, expanding medical care in Mamelodi, South Africa and providing sustainable aftercare opportunities for girls rescued from forced prostitution in India.We've always played the game differently. From friends who decided to start a church for people who'd given up on church, to pursuing a revolutionary approach to tackling poverty in our city, we've seen God call us to big thingsand we've watched as He's used our community to accomplish them. Join us on a spiritual journey to discover how God is calling us individually to engage in his work in the world, and right in our own backyards."
