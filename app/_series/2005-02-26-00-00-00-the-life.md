description: "Who was this guy Jesus and what was he really like? What did he really do? What did he really say? Jesus came so we could have life, and have it to the full. Great. So what does that mean? From late February through mid April we'll look at how Jesus talked about his life, our life and life in general. And we'll do this through the eyes of his best friend John. As part of this journey we'll be linking our weekend services with short personal readings and follow-up discussion in Life Groups during the week."
