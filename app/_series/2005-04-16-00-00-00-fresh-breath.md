description: "Consider the natural things we do - the rhythm of life, eating, sleeping, breathing. Now, think of prayer. For most of us it doesn't fit. For many of us, prayer has become this unnatural, planned thing we do at ''official'' places like church and the horse track. The picture of prayer we get from Jesus, however, is one that's anything but ''official'' and unnatural. In fact it's as easy, natural and spontaneous as breathing. Join us over these five weeks as we learn from how Jesus prayed and enjoy a few surprises along the way."
