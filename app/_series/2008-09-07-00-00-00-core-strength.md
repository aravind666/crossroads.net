description: "Knowing God isn't about layering on religion or hopping from one spiritual awakening to the next, but rather connecting with him in an ongoing and dynamic relationship. And like any relationship, this virtually always requires intentionality on our part. This September, join our discussion on connecting with God and building spiritual strength via the fundamental, three-part regimen of Bible reading, prayer and life in community. "
