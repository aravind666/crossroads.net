description: "Bombarded with the promises of savvy marketers and easy credit, we're offered beauty, significance, security and happiness in just six easy installments and low, low monthly payments. In the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, we often feel like we never have enough. But there's another way. There's freedom to be had in a more open-handed approach to our time, money and possessions. In that freedom, we can discover what it means to be consumed with the One who designed us to be so much more than a cog in a consumer-driven economy. And that will change everything."
