description: "Jesus often engaged those around him with word pictures and metaphors to help them understand eternal truths. And it was often elements from nature that he focused on. He seemed to say that theres deep learning about God that can be found when we look closer at the creation around us. Join us over these four weeks as we take a closer look at a few of these symbols he used and what they mean to our lives today."
