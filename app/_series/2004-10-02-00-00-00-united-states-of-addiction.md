description: "Its no secret. Addictions seem to be everywhere. There are those of us that wrestle with the big stuff. Maybe its feeling trapped by drugs or alcohol. Or something like sex, overeating or gambling. And then there are some of us that struggle with not so obvious poisons. But where is the line anyway? How do you know if something you have is actually having you? And is there really a way out? Join us in October as we look at how we tell if were flirting with an addiction and what tools God has given us for health."
