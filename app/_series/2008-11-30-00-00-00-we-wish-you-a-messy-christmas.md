description: "Christmas celebrates Jesus' birth&#58; peaceful, gentle and serene, right? Not even close. When He came into the world, Jesus caused quite a mess by challenging assumptions and stirring up controversy. Join us this holiday season as we consider the beautiful messes Jesus still makes when he comes into our lives."
