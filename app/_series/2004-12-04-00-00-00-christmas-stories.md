description: "Most of us know the basics of the story. Baby in a manger, the angels, the star, the elf who wants to be a dentist (OK, maybe some of us could use a refresher). But what we dont often think about is that it wasnt just one story. There were several very different stories that collided that one night in history. Join us in December as we look a little deeper into The Story by exploring several of these Christmas stories."
