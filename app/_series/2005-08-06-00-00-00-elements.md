description: "Elements&#58; Fundamental, essential and basic assumptions or principles of a subject or entity.   Remember squinting your eyes at that ugly multi-colored chart on the science room wall - The Periodic Table of Elements? Well, the elements are the basic building blocks of everything we see and experience. In the same way, there are some elements to knowing God that are so core and fundamental that without them things make little sense."
