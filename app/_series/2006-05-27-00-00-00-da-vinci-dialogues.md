description: "The recent Da Vinci Code phenomenon has made all kinds of news, and stirred up all kinds of controversy.  While were not here to slam the book or blast the new movie, the Da Vinci Code does raise a lot of great questions worthy of consideration.  This three-week series explores many of the questions and conspiracy theories surrounding Jesus, the church, the Bible and its purpose, context and reliability."
