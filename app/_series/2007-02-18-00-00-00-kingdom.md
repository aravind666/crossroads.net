description: "Jesus didn't come to bring a new religion. He came to start a revolution. He called it the ''Kingdom of God,'' and he said that it operates in a totally different way than the world we see around us. It's radical. It's counterintuitive. It's an alternative way of doing life based on receiving love from God and living out of sacrificial love for others. This revolution is advancing and unstoppable, and you are invited to play a significant role in it."
