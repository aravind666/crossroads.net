description: "Were drowning in Spirituality. It seems to be everywhere. You cant walk 5 feet at Joseph Beth, or turn on the TV or go to a movie without bumping into someones new and improved take on the meaning of life. But at the core is any of it really new or improved? And isnt it all really just saying the same thing anyway? Join us over these 4 weeks as we explore both the new and the timeless."
