description: "What is it about us and coffee? Whether it's a Starbucks on every corner or the atrium at Crossroads it's everywhere. Have you ever thought that maybe this whole thing is about more than what's in the cup? Maybe it's about the connection, the community we look for in these gathering places. Join over these four weeks as we go below the surface to look at this thing called ''community'' and what we can learn about ourselves through it."
