description: "We live in a state of constant connectedness. We're wired, wireless and ''on'' 24/7. In the middle of all this activity, we've somehow lost that healthy place where we just... BREATHE. We were not designed to live this way. Join us in October as we take a look at how we can find our way back to that place where we have ROOM TO BREATHE."
