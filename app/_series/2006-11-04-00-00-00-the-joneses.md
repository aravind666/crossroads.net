description: "Do you know the Joneses? They live in bigger houses, drive nicer cars and wear more stylish clothes than you do. Try as you might to keep up, they always seem to be a few steps ahead. Might sound familiar, but the reality is that 'the Joneses' are a lie - they're just an invisible standard propped up by a consumer culture that profits from telling us what and how much we 'should' have. And pursuing this standard only leads to personal, financial and spiritual wreckage. Join us in November as we expose the faade of 'the Joneses' and kick 'em to the curb."
