description: "When we hear the word ''lavish'' we might think of over-indulgence, excess and even waste. But from everything we read in the Bible, lavish is probably the best way to describe God's goodness toward us. The real question is whether or not we're willing to receive all that He wants to give us. Join us as we take a look at God's lavish love for us."
