description: "No matter our history or family of origin, we can all feel abandoned and alone. In the midst of life's challenges, it's easy to default to operating as emotional and spiritual orphans. But God has something better for us in store. Join us as we explore our true identities as God's beloved sons and daughters, and take our place of honor at the Father's table."
