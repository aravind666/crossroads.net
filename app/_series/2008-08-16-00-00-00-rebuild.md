description: "We're each uniquely wired to see things that are broken and to want to fix them. But vision alone isn't enough. We need a plan. We need to undertake both the mess and beauty of follow-through. In August, we're going to learn more about this by looking at the story of Nehemiah and how one man engaged with his fallen city and began a restoration."
