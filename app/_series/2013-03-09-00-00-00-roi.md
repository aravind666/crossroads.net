description: "Jesus was a progressive economist. He described money as a resource to be invested for a return, charity as a tired tradition, and a coming Kingdom full of industry and innovation that would turn the world on it's head. He said money holds unique and incredible power--to cripple and consume you, or to set you free.And the key to it all? Getting the maximum ROI."
