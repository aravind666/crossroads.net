description: "Crossroads might seem like a pretty unusual place. But there's a method to our madness. That's why we're spending four weeks talking about who we are and why we do what we do inside this place to affect change on the outside. Join us to discuss the work God's doing inside each of us, and how those changes impact our families, communities and the world."
