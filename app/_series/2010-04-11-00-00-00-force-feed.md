description: "We've all heard the saying, \"you are what you eat.\" Tha's also true when it comes to how we feed our heart, mind and soul with messages we receive through TV, radio, books, the web and even our mobile devices. Because we're constantly conformed by the messages we're fed, we need to be discerning about the agendas they represent, and how to make space in our lives to be transformed by truth."
