description: "Your home is bigger than you'd think. It's the roof over your head, the family that surrounds you, the city in which you live and the planet we all share. God has given us these communities and charged us with caring for and growing them. And it all starts very locally. The world will be changed when individual relationships, families and tight-knit communities are changed. So you want to change the world? GO HOME."
