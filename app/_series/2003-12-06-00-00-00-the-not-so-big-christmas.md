description: "The Christmas season seems to grow bigger every year. Its more cards, more gifts, more parties and well, just more. Somewhere in all of this weve started to wonder why bigger isnt turning out to be better. What if getting more out of this season is actually found in less? Join us in December as we look at how we can have the Christmas we really want, the Not So Big Christmas."
