description: "Special effects are everywhere. Sometimes they're these huge, obvious productions used to bring to life the destruction of the world or to convince us that Billy Bob Thornton is sexy. But other times they're more subtle, in the background and hardly noticeable. However they're used, they have one goal&#58; to move us through a story. The Bible can be like this for us. Sometimes we encounter a passage and it's so obvious it challenges us immediately and we're never the same. Other times, it's a slower burn that's harder to put our finger on. Join us this summer as we look at the special effects that different encounters with the Bible have had on someone's story."
