description: "YOU SHOULD DO MORE.YOU SHOULD MAKE MORE.YOU DESERVE MORE.  Simple statements that have crossed our radar and somehow managed to become a part of our identity. But what if those statements youve embraced as your identity are actually lies? Consider the decisions you make or the dreams you discard because you believe the lies. Consider the freedom to be who you were created to be. What if God loves you as he made you and you have tons to offer? That just might change things."
