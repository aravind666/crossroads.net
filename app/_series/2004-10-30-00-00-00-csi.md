description: "Its a dirty little secret. Success isnt always what we thought it would be. In fact, sometimes success can be more destructive to us as than failure. Join us over these 5 weeks as we investigate the good and the bad evidence from a string of intriguing lives and look for the clues God has left for our lives."
