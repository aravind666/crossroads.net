description: "We might not be as free as we think we are. Even worse, we may have been duped into believing a relationship with God is about layering on rules and restrictions. But the Bible says, \"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\" Not fear. Not guilt. Not morality or religion. Freedom. Get yours."
