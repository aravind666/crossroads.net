description: "Can a local church really make a difference in someone's life? How about an entire family? How about a neighborhood, a city or a nation? Hey, how about the whole world? Sounds crazy doesn't it? Join us during this series as we look at where Crossroads is going, the crazy plans that are part of it and what this all means for you."
