description: "Everybody loves super-heroes. Maybe it's because we're inspired by stories of everyday people moved to action for something they believe in. The Bible has its share of ''super-heroes,'' the faithful, who show us through their actions that faith isn't staticit's life in action. Join us as we take a look at some heroes of faith to learn how to become people of action in our own lives.   "
