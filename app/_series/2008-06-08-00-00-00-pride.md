description: "Dig under the surface of almost any weakness in your life and you'll find pride. It's the root that feeds a host of problems. Until we unearth it, the weeds will continue to sprout. So join us this June as we hear how pride has affected people in our communityand how the truth helped them (and could help you) get above ground."
