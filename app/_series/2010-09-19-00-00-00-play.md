description: "Everyone is designed to work hard, but in the name of working harder, achieving more, and getting ahead, we can be tempted to completely squeeze valuable times of rest and recreation out of our lives. Without those times our lives can lack rhythm and leave us less effective. Join us as we learn how to play."
