description: "Ever felt empty and looked to be filled with something? Jesus' followers did. They thirsted for God and couldn't understand why he said it'd be better for them if he left. Turns out, Jesus wanted to fill his followers with God's own Holy Spirit. Join us over the next four weeks to discover how we can be filled, too."
