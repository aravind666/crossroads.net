<p class="noPspace">In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated a community that was already struggling. At that time, Crossroads sent $150,000 and a truckload of donated supplies to the Gulf Region. Over the last 4 summers, Crossroads followed up by sending hundreds of people to build homes with Habitat for Humanity, to love on kids at Vacation Bible School, and to provide family portraits to families that lost their pictures in the flood. Even now, almost seven years later, much work remains for us to do. So we&#8217;re going back. God calls us to help those in need, and we will do everything we can to be a blessing. This summer, we&#8217;ll send XXX people to New Orleans (That&#8217;s two trips of XXX each).&#160;</p>

<p class="noPspace">Take a look at the recap video below from the 2014 trip to New Orleans for a taste of what the trip is like.</p>
