<p class="noPspace"><strong>MENTORING</strong> (ALL SITES)<br>Build a relationship with an at-risk student (grades 2-6) on their turf. Time commitment is at least twice each month. Get to know their families, introduce them to your friends, go to a baseball game, bring them to Crossroads...anything that shows the child that you care, and that you are a trusted part of his or her life. Mentoring is typically an extension of tutoring. You must commit to tutoring for at least 6 months prior to becoming a mentor.
