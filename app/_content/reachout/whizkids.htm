<h2>Whiz Kids</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Change your life by seeing the world through someone else&#8217;s eyes. </span><br><br>And change a child&#8217;s life by giving your time and heart. Help tutor and mentor at-risk kids. Their test scores radically improve, and most importantly, <strong>they begin to feel hope</strong>.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Serve at-risk kids and impact the life of a child&#160;during the school year. From weekly to as-needed,&#160;the time commitments are as varied as the roles.&#160;In Oakley, we partner with students from&#160;Rothenberg Academy and Pleasant Ridge&#160;Montessori. In Mason, we partner with Mason&#160;Early Childhood Center, Mason Intermediate and Western Row.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><br><strong>DAYTIME TUTORING&#160;</strong>(OAKLEY)<strong><br></strong>Help students (grades K-8) with reading or math during the school day at Rothenberg Academy or Pleasant Ridge Montessori.

<p class="noPspace"><strong>SIGN UP TO SERVE</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">All volunteer positions for the current school year have been fulfilled. Please check back in the coming months.&#160;</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>MENTORING</strong> (OAKLEY &amp; MASON)<br>Build a relationship with an at-risk student (grades 2-6) on their turf. Time commitment is at least twice each month. Get to know their families, introduce them to your friends, go to a baseball game, bring them to Crossroads...anything that shows the child that you care, and that you are a trusted part of his or her life. Mentoring is typically an extension of tutoring. You must commit to tutoring for at least 6 months prior to becoming a mentor.
