<h2>Fall Feast on Thanksgiving Day</h2>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Serve with City Gospel Mission and Give Back Cincinnati</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">In 2009, our partner City Gospel Mission joined Fall Feast, a city-wide event created by Give Back Cincinnati that takes place at the Duke Energy Center. Now, we serve beside them each Thanksgiving. Hundreds of volunteers prepare and serve Thanksgiving dinner to people who might not otherwise enjoy one, and guests receive gifts such as free coats, haircuts, vision screenings and flu shots. This year, we&#8217;ll give away over 5,000 coats to men, women and children in need and over 1,000 people will receive medical care on-site will free follow up care if needed.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Crossroads volunteers also serve meals at nursing homes, shelters and other care facilities across the city so that people who cannot attend the meal downtown or who would otherwise be alone will have community on Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p class="noPspace">In the past four years, thousands upon thousands of people have been served, with loads of food and loads of love.</p>
