<h2>ReachOut: Whiz Kids</h2>
<span class="first">Change your life by seeing the world through someone else's eyes. </span><br><br>And
change a child's life, by giving your time and heart. Help tutor and
mentor at-risk kids. Their test scores radically improve, and most
importantly, <strong>they begin to feel hope</strong>. <br><br>Serve at-risk kids and impact the life of a child
during the school year. From weekly to as-needed, time commitments are
as varied as the roles. We partner with students from Rothenberg Academy and Pleasant Ridge Montessori in Oakley and Mason Heights Elementary in Mason. Whiz Kids offers three main volunteer
opportunities:<br><br><strong>DAYTIME TUTORS </strong>(OAKLEY)<strong><br></strong>Help students (grades K-8) with reading or math during the school day at Rothenberg Academy or Pleasant Ridge Montessori. Time commitment is an hour per week.<br><br><strong>MONDAY TUTORS </strong><strong>(OAKLEY AND MASON)</strong><br>Join
the army of volunteers to help run this weekly program on Monday nights
at Crossroads Oakley and Monday afternoons in Mason, where students (grades 2-8) receive a nutritious meal,
tutoring help, exposure to the arts and life lessons. Time commitment =
every Monday. Volunteer opportunities include: <br><ul>
<li>Tutor</li>
<li>Dinner/Snack Buddy</li>
<li>Meal Prep/Server</li>
<li>Large Group Programming</li>
</ul>
<strong>MENTORING</strong> (OAKLEY)<br>Build
a relationship with an at-risk student (grades 3-8) on their turf. Time
commitment is at least twice each month. Get to know their families,
introduce them to your friends, go to a baseball game, bring them to
Crossroads...anything that shows the child that you care, and you are a
trusted part of his or her life. <br><br><a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/WhizKids.htm" title="Whiz Kids Next Steps">Hop over here for next steps</a>. <em>(If you're not already signed in, you'll be asked to do so, or to register for crossroads.net.)<br><br></em>
