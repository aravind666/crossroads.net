<h2>Medical and Physician Opportunities</h2>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Thank you for expressing interest in our medical and physician team. This page will allow you to get a deeper glimpse on some of the initiatives that we are focused on, and where we need support from a medical perspective. We currently have a major focus on South Africa, but we&#8217;ll have additional needs overtime in India, CityLink Center, etc. The below information should be a solid guide pertaining to our new partnership with The Topsy Foundation. We&#8217;ve also included a survey at the bottom of the page that will allow us to capture the varying degrees of expertise and interest within our medical community. We appreciate your interest and hope to see you on a future trip.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Over the past 18 months, Crossroads has been in the process of forming a strong partnership with the Topsy Foundation, a non-profit organization in South Africa that cares for HIV/AIDS and TB patients in a rural area of South Africa about 1.5 hours drive outside of Johannesburg. (To better understand Topsy, we recommend you read their <a title="Topsy annual report" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/topsyfoundationannualreport2011.pdf" target="_blank">annual report</a>, as well as two articles from <a title="The Economist" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/economist_special_report_on_sa.pdf" target="_blank">The Economist</a> and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/lancet_special_report_on_sa.pdf">The Lancet</a>.) Topsy has asked Crossroads to regularly send small medical teams that can provide specialty services that they can&#8217;t provide and that are not available in this rural area of the country.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Crossroads has already started these efforts by sending a team of dentists to Topsy in February 2012. Most of the people in that area of South Africa had never seen a dentist in their lives and would not have had the opportunity to see a dentist unless we had provided that service. Topsy lined up their patients (some in great pain) and our dentists were able to treat them. Crossroads has already agreed to help fund Topsy&#8217;s home-based care program for this coming fiscal year, and we intend to take more dental teams likely starting in Q1 2013 with another in Q3/Q4 2013.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The MDs and DMDs who have visited Topsy with us over the past year have all said it was the cleanest and best organized medical facility they have witnessed in South Africa. No longer will we be working out of tents. And it&#8217;s our hope that as our relationship with Topsy develops, there will be a continuum of care provided, and that we will reach a point where we have Crossroads-sponsored medical professionals on the ground more often than not.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Topsy has suggested (as examples) that we send teams of urologists, gynecologists, radiologists (to better train Topsy&#8217;s staff on reading x-rays), podiatrists, etc. In an effort to meet their needs, we must first know what resources we can leverage within our medical community. That said, we are trying identify how many medical contacts we have to work with, who is interested in serving in South Africa, what are their specialties and availability, etc.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Once we capture this information, we can go to Topsy and discuss what is possible in the coming years. In addition, if Topsy doesn&#8217;t need a certain skill set, we aren&#8217;t going to force the issue. That said, there will always be the opportunity for physicians to go on a trip and support the work. You may not be able to work specifically in your area of expertise, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t be a doctor and help fulfill the mission. In the past, we&#8217;ve even had physicians working alongside our dentists in the dental clinic. We are also talking about doing some more education-focused trips to help build up the Topsy staff. And, Topsy managers are talking to the local government about possibly getting access to a surgical suite that could help facilitate outpatient surgeries, opening up the opportunity for more specialists to engage.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>To plan this project effectively, we need some information from you.</strong> Note, there is no commitment attached to you by filling out the below survey. It simply tells us that you might be interested in going to South Africa to serve if the opportunity presents itself. This will help us to know who is interested and what skills are at our disposal. We will then talk to Topsy about possibilities and, hopefully by the end of this year, start to assemble a good plan to support Topsy for the coming years.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">INSERT SURVEY</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Below are a few things we&#8217;d like you to know about Crossroads&#8217; trips.</p>
<p class="noPspace">-&#160;Anyone is invited, regardless of their beliefs, experience with Crossroads or experience in international mission work. As long as someone wants to serve, we want them to go with us. We encourage people to invite friends and colleagues to consider going with us. Sometime soon we will create an online invitation that will make it easy for you to invite others.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- Every Crossroads trip will include things like attending Grace Bible Church services (an awesome cultural experience), visiting historical sites, like the Apartheid Museum, going on a safari, and working really hard.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- Trips range from 8-10 days, and volunteer leadership will be on each trip to ensure everyone is taken care of.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- Trips range from $2500 and $3000 (depending on flight costs) and are all-inclusive. If participants are not able to pay for the trip themselves, they have the opportunity to raise the money using our online system to ask friends and family to support them. We do allow participants on small trips to upgrade airplane seats if they are willing to pay the (huge) cost to do so.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- Participants in small medical trips will be able to make their own arrangements to travel before/after your trip if you desire (i.e. Cape Town, Victoria Falls, etc.) We can&#8217;t help with these arrangements, and we have some rules as to when you will need to be in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- We encourage married couples and families (with older kids) to go together. Every small medical team will have a collection of non-skilled participants who can support the work of the team.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- All trip participants are covered by a separate health insurance policy that we purchase as part of the trip cost. We are also looking into inexpensive, temporary medical mission malpractice insurance to ensure everyone is protected.</p>
<p class="noPspace">- All physicians and dentists will need to be credentialed by the Health Professions Council for South Africa (HPCSA). This will involve the timely delivery of documents, including copy of diploma, medical license, letter of good standing, etc.</p>
