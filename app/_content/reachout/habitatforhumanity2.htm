<h2>Habitat for Humanity</h2>
<span class="first">Pick up a hammer and help us build a home for a family in need.</span><br><br>Our city has one of the lowest home ownership rates in the country.
Only 42% of residents in our city own their homes, compared to 68%
nationally. Statistically speaking, home ownership leads to significant
increases in family stability, financial security and a sense of
belonging to the community. And all of those things increase the
likelihood that children can escape a cycle of poverty.<br><br>We believe that decent, affordable housing for all people is something that God cares about deeply.<br><br>So join
us on Saturdays as we give volunteer labor to help build homes in
Cincinnati. Come every week, one Saturday or anywhere in between. No
construction experience is required. <br><br>If you'd like to help out, <a href="/content/reachout/habitatforhumanity.htm" title="my serve habitat">click here</a> for more specific information about our current construction project and to fill out an application. <em>(If you're not already signed in, you'll be asked to do so, or to register for crossroads.net.)<br></em>
