<p class="noPspace">Our city has one of the lowest home ownership rates in the country. Only 42% of residents in our city own their homes, compared to 68% nationally. Statistically speaking, home ownership leads to significant increases in family stability, financial security and a sense of belonging to the community. And all of those things increase the likelihood that children can escape a cycle of poverty.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We&#8217;re starting a new home for the Thomas family and we&#8217;d love your help. It&#8217;s good to know:</p>
