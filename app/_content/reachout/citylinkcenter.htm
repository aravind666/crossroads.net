<h2>ReachOut: CityLink</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><br><span class="first">We believe we need a revolutionary approach to defeating the cycle of poverty in our city.</span><br><br>Because there is no current infrastructure equipped to handle the thousands of volunteer hours per year that Crossroads could generate, we&#8217;ve joined a consortium of local churches and non-profit organizations to build CityLink, a centralized campus where people can connect with each other and with the services they need to find holistic life change and break the cycles of poverty.<br><br>The process of making CityLink a reality has been challenging, but we&#8217;re making a lot of progress.&#160; In the meantime, we&#8217;re forging ahead with several <strong>CityLink Now initiatives</strong> alongside several partner organizations:</p>
