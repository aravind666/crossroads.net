<p class="noPspace"><span class="subheading">Considering Your GO Trip Options</span></p>

<p class="noPspace">It&#8217;s ultimately up to you to decide which trip is best for you, but we can suggest a couple of ways to think about it. Begin by looking at trip descriptions on the <a title="GO Somewhere (Trips)" href="/go">GO Somewhere page</a>&#8212;it&#8217;ll give you a sense of the desired skill sets and other needs for each trip. It might also be helpful to know how we think about these trips. We generally look at GO trips in two ways:</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>THE BIG TRIPS: SOUTH AFRICA &amp; NEW ORLEANS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">These are open to anybody who&#8217;s at least 13. Big trips are high energy events; they&#8217;re great opportunities for someone looking to engage deeper in the Crossroads community, to be part of something bigger than themselves and to serve others. There&#8217;s no spiritual test to pass, and no special skills required&#8212;everyone is welcome.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>SPECIALIZED TRIPS: INDIA</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Our work in Mumbai and Kolkata is a little different. The intensity of our work fighting sex trafficking calls for a higher level of emotional maturity than the other trips. While you won&#8217;t be kicking down brothel doors, you will probably be spending much-needed time building into our partners and the local Indian church as they journey into providing quality aftercare for survivors of trafficking and making the bold move to sustainable independence.&#160;</p>
