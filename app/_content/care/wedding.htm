<h2>Weddings</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">If you just got engaged, first of all, congratulations!</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We&#8217;d love to partner with you as you begin to build a strong foundation for your lifetime of marriage. We aren&#8217;t about just doing weddings here&#8212;we&#8217;re about building into marriages. For that reason, anyone desiring to get married in Crossroads&#8217; chapel or by a Crossroads pastor will need to be a part of our wedding process. This is a fun and engaging process that will provide some necessary tools for a healthy marriage.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We believe that marriage is a sacred covenant established by God to teach two people to love each other with God&#8217;s kind of love, for better or worse, for a lifetime. It&#8217;s not a 50-50 proposition, but a 100% commitment by both people to love and serve one other. Crossroads will marry two Christ-followers, OR two people who are not Christ-followers but have similar spiritual desires, but we won&#8217;t marry a couple where only one person is following Jesus. This is based on what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 6:14-16, and also on experience that has shown there can be great tension caused by a couple not sharing a common spiritual foundation. Also, at least one member of the couple must have attended Crossroads regularly for at least six months, and considers this place to be their &#8220;home&#8221; church.</p>
