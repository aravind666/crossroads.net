<h2>Weddings FAQ</h2>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What is required for me to get married at Crossroads?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We really value preparing for marriage and have built a whole process around investing in your relationship--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we ask that you enter our process at least four months before your ceremony date</span>. We ask that all couples who are planning to get married at Crossroads or by a Crossroads pastor fully engage with our Premarital Process. We aren&#8217;t just a venue, we are about your spiritual growth and the growth of your relationship.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We&#8217;ll give you more in-depth instructions once you&#8217;ve put your date on hold, but the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">goal of our premarital process is to create an environment for you to reflect on how spirituality, finances, communication skills and community all factor into your relationship. The majority of the work happens in the first 30 days of being in the process so make sure that you&#8217;re prepared to set aside some time that first month.</span> Some of these environments will be individual reflection, some just you and your fiance with another couple, and some will be group-oriented. If you have specific questions, email <a href="mailto:weddings@crossroads.net">weddings@crossroads.net</a>.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Can I choose the pastor that will marry us?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yes, you can request a specific pastor but we cannot guarantee they will be available. Feel free to let us know who you would prefer to do your ceremony. Brian Tome and Chuck Mingo are not available to officiate, given their weekend responsibilities at Crossroads. Our Spiritual Growth Team pastors perform most weddings. However, many ministry directors are also marrying pastors. <a href="/sendMail/16">Contact</a> our pastoral care coordinator for more information.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If I don&#8217;t know a pastor at Crossroads, how will you assign me?</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We have an incredible team of pastors and any of them will do a great job at officiating a wedding, but we know that it is the details that can make that relationship really connect. We help match you by sending you a survey that captures what you are looking for in a pastor and a little bit about yourself. That information from the survey helps us make some suggestions of who would be a good match for you. We guarantee that we will match you with a pastor at least 2 months before your wedding, most are much earlier. However the timeline depends on how easy it is to match you with a pastor based on availability and fit. If we need to, we&#8217;ll spent a bit more time to make sure we get the match right.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Can an outside pastor perform our ceremony at Crossroads?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yes. We do ask, however, that you provide the contact information for the visiting pastor so we can connect with him/her and make sure that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Can I get married at another location other than the Crossroads Chapel?</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yes! About only half of Crossroads weddings are on-site. We will send a Crossroads marrying pastor to an off-site location anywhere in the Greater Cincinnati Area. If you are considering a destination wedding or a ceremony a bit farther away, just let us know at <a href="mailto:weddings@crossroads.net">weddings@crossroads.net</a> and we can see if it is a doable distance.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Do I have to attend Crossroads to get married here?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We require that one or both of you are regular Crossroads attenders. &#160;A regular attender is defined as someone who has been attending Crossroads for the past six months.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Do my fiance and I have to both believe in God to be married at Crossroads?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Both must be Christ-followers or both must be seekers. We want you to be on the same page. This is based on what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 6:14-16, and also on experience that has shown there can be great tension caused by a couple not sharing a common spiritual foundation.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>May we have our reception at Crossroads?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Due to time and space constraints, we are unable to offer wedding receptions at Crossroads.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>How many people does the chapel hold?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The chapel comfortably seats 250 people.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What are the basics about using the Crossroads Chapel?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- On weekdays, the chapel is available for weddings or rehearsals after 6:30pm.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- We&#8217;re more flexible on Saturdays.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- Keep our weekend service times in mind when planning the date and time of your wedding as noise from Kids&#8217; Club and the Atrium, as well as traffic and parking can be...interesting. You can find our service times </span><a style="line-height: 1.75;" href="/about/serviceTimes.php">here</a><span style="line-height: 1.75;">.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- We recommend 11AM, 3 or 3:30PM, or 6:30PM as the wedding times that work best with the weekend services.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- The chapel is not available for weddings on Sundays.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- The best place to park for a wedding is on the east side of the building. The chapel entrance is the glass entrance closest to AutoZone.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- Currently, the only available Crossroads Chapel is the Oakley Chapel. The Crossroads Mason Chapel will open for limited weddings in February 2015.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Is there a set wedding service that Crossroads follows, or may I individualize my service?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You are more than welcome to work with your pastor to individualize your service in order to celebrate your day personally. See the Wedding Resources section of this web site for a sample wedding service outline.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>May we decorate the chapel?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Yes; minimal decorations are welcome. Decorating may begin in the chapel two hours before your scheduled wedding time. Please <a href="/sendMail/16">contact us</a> to let our pastoral care coordinator know your decorating plans, as there are a few decorating guidelines for the chapel.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What is Building Blocks for Marriage and how do I sign up for the class?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Building Blocks for Marriage classes are held at Crossroads four times a year. They focus</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">on skill building, relationships and stories of married couples&#8217; lives. We encourage you to</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">enroll in classes for community and group learning. The topics covered include: personalities, family heritage, biblical marriage, prayer, communication, love languages, sex, conflict resolution and forgiveness. The classes are a combination of large group experience, small group discussion with a married couple facilitating, and one-on-one time with your future spouse.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The classes are held on three consecutive Saturdays, which include two half-day classes (8:30AM-2:30PM) and one morning class (8:30AM-12:30PM).</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">If you are entering a Stepfamily situation, you are required to attend the Step Panel on the third Saturday from 12:30PM-2:30PM. Lunch is provided.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S-0qbAt9L0CmwJATaLEkdWxooewac79l-vVQaNYbNSo/viewform">Click here for the signup form and to see upcoming dates for Building Blocks.</a></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>If I&#8217;ve signed up for Building Blocks for Marriage, am I signed up for the Premarital Process?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Building Blocks for Marriage is a stand-alone class and attending it does not indicate that you are in the Crossroads premarital process. In fact, about half the couples that take Building Blocks don&#8217;t get married at Crossroads or by a Crossroads pastor. If you&#8217;re getting married at Crossroads or by a Crossroads pastor, we want you to participate in Building Blocks for Marriage! We think it is one of the best things we do around here. But Building Blocks is only one of many steps in our process so the sign up forms are separate.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What if Building Blocks for Marriage schedule doesn&#8217;t work for me?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You may also choose professional Christian counseling. A minimum of seven sessions are required if you choose not to attend the Building Blocks for Marriage classes. A trained professional counselor can lead you through testing that identifies your individual personality types. Also, he or she can work with you to see how both your personalities, no matter how different, need to be honored and valued in your relationship.</p>
