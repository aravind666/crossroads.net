<p class="noPspace">If you&#8217;re skeptical about God, if you&#8217;re wrestling with who God is,&#160;this group may help you sort through the unanswered questions.There are tons of obstacles on the path to saying yes to Jesus. Questions about his character, his identity and how he feels about us can be a few along the journey.&#160;We&#8217;ll meet and explore these questions to learn more about God&#8217;s story.</p>
