<h1>Adoption &amp; Foster Family Resources</h1>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">We are adoptive, foster and kinship parents who are committed to caring for the fatherless. We join together to grow through training, education and most importantly building community with other adoptive and foster families. We are encouraged as we share stories and learn from others who are on a similar journey. We believe that the church can be a part of equipping and empowering families as we together &#8220;take up the cause of the fatherless&#8221; Isaiah 1:17.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">As both a writer and public speaker, Carissa brings a unique perspective as a Korean adult adoptee and professional counselor/marriage and family therapist as she speaks with authenticity, humor and insight. For every adoptive and foster parent, there is a sacred story of how a child entered their family. But for the child there is a story that is often untold, a story of loss and brokenness and shame, a story of the heart. These two stories share space and a place in the heart of every adoptee. Carissa shares both the brokenness and beauty from her own story, the impact loss has on the human heart and mind, and what it looks like to discover the truth, hope and redemption that exists in every adoptee&#8217;s story.</p>
