<h2>Going Deeper</h2><span class="first">Wednesdays from 7-8:30pm at Crossroads</span><br /><br />For anyone wanting to grow in relationship with God, this topical Bible study translates spiritual truths into real world transformation. This group begins with large group teaching, followed by small group discussions of the teaching topic. Come for a week to check it out, or stay for the whole teaching series.<br /><br /><strong>Childcare</strong><br />Childcare for nursery through fifth grade is available in Kids&rsquo; Club only by reservation in advance. Donations of $5/ child or $10/ family will help cover the cost. (A ten-child minimum is required per session/ date. If this minimum is not met, childcare will not be provided for that session and you&rsquo;ll be notified three days prior to the session.)<br /><br />
