<h2>CSM SR</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">An experiment to change our world through God's love.</span><br><br>We are literally experimenting to see how we can be a part of world change...and we're starting with our world. The "whole" world is a bit overwhelming. So come and check it out. Meet some new friends. Start moving with us. We're not going to entertain you...but if you want to engage in the experiment...CSM is the place for you.<br><br></p>
<h3>WHEN WE MEET</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Oakley Campus:  6:15pm Saturday &amp; 11:45am Sunday<br>Mason Campus:  11:30am Sunday<br><br></p>
<h3>CURRENT SERIES</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>PINEAPPLE.</strong><br>Just imagine the first person to discover the pineapple. It's not exactly a fruit you just pick up and take a bite out of...pretty rough, pretty sharp, not as easy to get to the good stuff...or even know it's in there. Sometimes following God is just like a pineapple...you've gotta push through all the rough stuff that is in the way in order to get to the unexpected sweetness on the inside. Come hang with us as we discover what pineapples can teach us about serving others. <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacyhttp://www.crossroads.net/mysend/3" target="_blank">click here to contact Justin Wolfenberg</a>.

<h3>COMING UP</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>GO CINCINNATI with CSM on Saturday, May 16!<br> </strong>Sign up to hang with CSM when you come on Sunday. CSM kids and leaders can choose to help assemble care packages headed to children in slavery in Haiti (thru the Restavec Foundation)...or, you can head downtown to help invite people and spread the word about a huge party called "GO GRUB" for homeless people in the Over th Rhine area. It's gonna be good. And if you're in CSM Mason, we'll be headed up to King's Domain to get our hands dirty on some sweet projects on their grounds. Don't miss it!<br> <br> <strong>NEXT SERIES: "UP"<br> </strong>It's graduation time! Sixth graders moving UP from Kids' Club to CSM. Eighth graders moving UP to CSM SR High. And Seniors heading out of CSM. So we'll be celebrating, welcoming, and experimenting as we learn about a guy in the Old Testament named Samuel...and how he grew UP in the Lord.</p>
