<h2>Body and Soul&#160; <br>
</h2>
<span class="first">Six Mondays: September 29-November 3. 6:30-8pm</span><br>Connect with other women who want to understand how God fits into forming a healthy body image.<p><br>You might struggle with weight or feel guilty about what you eat. You might be tired of failed diets and exercise programs. Whatever the case, join us as we discuss ways to grow our connections with God and each other. We'll meet in both large and small groups, and get to know each other's stories and experiences. You don't have to go through this alone.<br> <br>This is not a weight-loss program; it's a place where you can experience mutual accountability and encouragement in a community of like-minded women.<br> <br>Six Mondays: Sept. 29, Oct. 6, 13, 20, 27, Nov. 3; 6:30-8pm</p>
