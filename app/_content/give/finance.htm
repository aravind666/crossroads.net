<p class="header noPspace">Financial Philosophy</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Many believe the Bible says &#8220;money is the root of all evil.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noPspace">Not true. What it actually says is &#8220;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8230;&#8221; (1 Timothy 6:10). Well, we don&#8217;t &#8220;love&#8221; it, we just &#8220;like it as a friend.&#8221; Here&#8217;s how finances work at Crossroads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generous people in our community love contributing to the things they see God doing around here. So they give, and <strong>we use that money to bless others</strong>. </li>
<li>
<strong>We base our budget on what we believe God wants</strong>, not on what we think we&#8217;ll get.</li>
<li>
<strong>Money gets spent here, not stashed</strong>. People give to Crossroads so we can build into the community, not a mutual fund.</li>
</ol>
