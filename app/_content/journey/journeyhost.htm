<h1>What is a Journey Host?</h1>
<p class="noPspace">Being a host means that you welcome a small group of 6-12 people into your home&#8212;or another suitable spot&#8212;for six weeks. You don&#8217;t need to have all the answers, and we don&#8217;t expect you to be a Bible expert or therapist. Just be friendly, inclusive, a quiet leader and a good role model.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><span>-Be a timekeeper. Just be sure your group is starting and ending at the agreed upon time.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span>-Bring everyone into the conversation. If you notice someone being quiet, ask if they&#8217;d like to give some input.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span>-Make it safe&#8212;respect any and all questions.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span>-Feel free to pray for your group during group time.&#160;</span></p>
