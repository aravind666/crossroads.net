We believe that big impact results from the life change that happens in small community. <strong>Because we're not made to do life alone.</strong> So God uses intimate connections with other people as catalysts for change—in us, in our relationships with him and others, in our families and in the world. Big stuff. Ready for something big? Start by getting small. <br><br><a href="">Register</a>, and you'll see more about how Small Groups happen. <a href="">Why register?
