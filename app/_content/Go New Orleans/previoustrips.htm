 <br /><br /><br /><h3>TRIP BLOG </h3><br /><h3>08.08.08 | Friday &ndash; Transformation </h3>
 <p>Only a week ago we were at our homes, stuffing our last pair of socks in our
suitcases. This week has flown by. Unlike our normal day-to-days, each
day this week held something new. We slept hard each night because of
the fullness of our days. Full not just with the foods and sounds of
New Orleans, but with the love that we&rsquo;ve received from one another,
from the New Orleanians we met, and from the joy of serving. We&rsquo;re
tired, for sure, and we miss our families, so we&rsquo;re almost ready to go
home. But we still had one more day in which to complete what we came
here to do and say our good-byes.</p><p>The children in VBS were
entirely different today than they were on Monday. Monday, only three
kids wanted to get on stage and sing with our volunteers during the
opening worship rally. Tuesday, a few boys had joined the girls, which
totally surprised Pastor Mack, one of the pastors at Franklin Avenue
Baptist. Today, nearly three-quarters of the kids ran to the stage to
sing. Not only that, they were hugging on our people, laughing with
them, telling tall tales, and loving us. One of the kids told one of
our volunteers they liked us because we &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play favorites.&rdquo; God
loves us all equally, and we did our best to love those kids the same
way. </p><p>On the Habitat sites, on this our last work day, we pushed
just a little bit harder. (That&rsquo;s pretty darn hard. The Habitat and
Americorps volunteers who manage the sites have said that they were
extremely pleased and somewhat surprised by how hard our crews worked.
One even said we were his favorite, though he probably says that to all
his groups.) Our work truly reflected these words from Nehemiah 4:6 &ndash;
&ldquo;for the people worked with all their heart.&rdquo; </p><p>Today we did have
our first accident on the work site: one man fell off the roof and
fractured his toe. Don&rsquo;t know about you&mdash;but knowing that this man only
fractured his toe, we think God may have been looking out for him. And
for this trip, too, for that matter. All in all, our crews completed 23
projects. That&rsquo;s phenomenal! More phenomenal are the people who now
call each other friends because of these projects, and the people who
saw God through our work and decided to get baptized. </p><p><img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/baptism-web-nola.gif" alt="Baptism in Nola" hspace="10" width="400" height="265" align="left" />Celebrating
the week with baptisms is something Crossroads has done in Mamelodi,
South Africa, too. You never know how God will move people, or how many
will feel called to publicly proclaim that Jesus is their lord and
savior. Everyone&rsquo;s journey is different. This afternoon, 30 people were
baptized. We feel humbled and honored that we got to be a part of this
experience. We can&rsquo;t wait for them to tell you all their stories. </p><h4>The joy of the city beneath the sea </h4><p>The
hope of the people in this city is a like a thirst that can&rsquo;t be
quenched. You might think New Orleanians would be sad or angry after
all the devastation wrought by Katrina. But the atmosphere here is not
of sadness or despair. People don&rsquo;t seem to be mourning a loss. Perhaps
they did mourn for friends or relatives, or for the belongings they
can&rsquo;t replace, or the pets they lost. But now, they seem to be
celebrating the life of a city that&rsquo;s part of their family. New Orleans
is in their blood. After only a week here, it&rsquo;s starting to be in ours,
too. </p><p>We&rsquo;ve been here long enough to understand how unique this
city is&mdash;in its architecture, its food, its music, it&rsquo;s vibe and its
vibrancy. It&rsquo;s easy to see why people love this city and want to come
back and rebuild, which is why leaving saddens us a bit. We have a
feeling may of us will be back. </p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * </p><h3>08.07.08 | Thursday -  Appreciation <br /></h3>
<p><img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/Musicians-village1.jpg" alt="Musician's Village" hspace="10" width="400" height="260" align="left" />We&rsquo;ve
heard a lot of thank yous in the last few days, from the homeowners,
each other and the kids at the Vacation Bible School (VBS). More
importantly, we&rsquo;re learning to thank God for everything, no matter how
small, like ice and slushies on a 90 degree day, a cool breeze, a spot
of shade, a challenging child who is suddenly calm, for not having to
work on the roof all day&mdash;and for those crazy amazing people who have
been willing to work on the roof all day (the hottest place on the work
site). Life is really simple when the focus is serving others, and
remarkable change happens when we aren&rsquo;t focusing so much on having a
life changing experience, but rather when we&rsquo;re simply present in the
moment.</p><p>So many memorable moments have happened today. Here&rsquo;s a taste.</p><h4>Habitat work sites:</h4><p><img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/crawfish1.JPG" alt="Crawfish" hspace="10" width="350" height="232" align="left" />Emma,
one of the homeowners in Central City, bought the work team a lunch of
boiled crawfish, shrimp, crabs, potatoes, and corn. This delectably
spicy meal was true New Orleans cuisine. She wanted to share the with
us the authentic flavor she loves so much, as a thank you for all of
our work. She loves this city, and wanted us to love it, too. And she
made us promise to come see her again.</p><p>We mentioned this
yesterday, but it&rsquo;s so cool we had to bring it up again. Servant hearts
are shining among our team. It&rsquo;s pretty remarkable to see everyone
pitching in to help, no matter how hot it is or how menial the task.
And folks are having fun! You can hear laughter everywhere, and smiles
are easy to come by. Imagine 300 people who have their palms up and
wide open, just asking how they can help, and you&rsquo;ll have a vision of
our team. God is pouring into them in return.</p><h4>VBS:</h4><p>K<img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/Nick-vbs1.JPG" alt="Nick at VBS" hspace="10" width="350" height="232" align="left" />ids
are connecting with us and opening up to us more every day. Some have
shared that they lost a sister or an aunt during Katrina, and we&rsquo;re so
glad they feel comfortable enough to share these things with us.</p><p>One
boy proudly took home the flip flops that he had decorated during the
crafts session of VBS. His grandmother saw the flip flops and told the
boy not to get them dirty since those were his good shoes now. After he
told a couple of our volunteers this, they gathered some money from our
crew and bought him a new pair of shoes.</p><p>During one class, the
kids were asked to share what they are thankful for, and most of them
said they are thankful for our team, and said they loved us. </p><h4>Fun</h4><p>This
evening we got a chance to experience the city from a different
perspective: we took a dinner cruise on the steamboat Nachez, where we
listened to jazz and shared stories. Oh, and we ate bread pudding.
(There&rsquo;s a lot of bread pudding here.) It was a chance to relax and
just hang out with our 300 new friends, to catch our (collective)
breath before a final day of work.</p><p>We are so thankful for this
week, and for this opportunity to serve. The homes we&rsquo;re building are
just a few of the thousands that need to be built. Knowing that can
make our projects seem so small. But the people who live here don&rsquo;t
take what we&rsquo;re doing lightly. They love that we&rsquo;re here. And we love
the work and the people here. We&rsquo;re planting seeds of love in people&rsquo;s
hearts, both here in New Orleans and among our own team. There&rsquo;s
nothing small about that.</p><p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll savor all the sweat, the
smiles on kids, the friendships we&rsquo;ve made. To celebrate the week, all
300 of us will gather at the end of the work day at First Baptist for a
special service, where we&rsquo;ll baptize anyone who feels called to declare
their faith and seal in their hearts what Jesus has done for them. </p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * </p><h3>08.06.08 | Wednesday &ndash; Growth  </h3><p>It&rsquo;s
been a long, hot, and incredible day. This morning Todd initiated a new
morning rite: singing a blues song about something that happened the
previous day. Throughout the day people come up with a blues line and
give it to Todd for consideration. This a.m. it was the
I&rsquo;ve-got-the-someone-ate-my-breakfast sandwich blues. Other contenders
for tomorrow include the it&rsquo;s-so-hot-I-burned-my-butt blues and the
wow-give-those-kids-some-Ridalin blues. (Those are not the exact
titles, but you get the gist. It&rsquo;s late, and we&rsquo;ve been up since before
6 a.m., so give us some grace on this one.) </p><p>Stories abound from all groups and work sites. We&rsquo;ll capture just a few here. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/VBS-2.JPG" alt="VBS" hspace="10" width="250" height="138" align="left" />At
Vacation Bible School, kids returned with more enthusiasm. They happily
donated money (coins or whatever dollar bills they had) to a mission
project that Franklin Avenue Baptist sponsors. In the craft room, kids
decorated flip flops. They were digging it. But halfway through the
morning, the biggest sizes were gone, and lots of kids still needed
them. So, one of our volunteers quickly switched gears and told the
boys to make these for a cousin or brother or family member. And they
happily did. One boy happily decorated flip flops for his aunt, whom he
lives with in New Orleans. He was excited to do something for her and
not for himself. A favorite of the day were the relay races during
recreation. Kids were crazy excited. (Maybe this is where the Ridalin
blues came from&hellip;) </p><p>Many of the work sites have met the
homeowners, who all have unique stories. This is just one: One home is
for a woman with a 10 year-old son and her 16 year-old niece, whose
mother died in Katrina. Talk about God showing up and providing for
this family. </p><p>The strongest theme coming from all of our teams
is growth. Teams are selflessly looking out for one another, making
sure everyone has water or is taking breaks. Teams are doing grunt work
without complaint. Ideas about serving others are pouring out. In one
instance, a homeowner has been sick and hasn&rsquo;t been able to put in
their hours (sweat equity) required to be able to get their home, so
they can&rsquo;t yet move in. One of our volunteers suggested that we could
eliminate that barrier by donating our volunteer hours to this person.
So simple&mdash;and so brilliant. The servant hearts of our volunteers are
shining. </p><p>And that continued tonight, as we celebrated the day
and got together as GO Groups after dinner. Each group was asked to
call out in one another the things they see. Jesus calls us to receive
and to be restored in order for us to go out and bless others, and so
we were asked to call out in each other the ways we see God working
through one another, the positive characteristics that others have
exhibited. All we can say is God was in the hotel tonight. We don&rsquo;t
often spend an hour or two simply building into others, so the beauty
of what happens when we do can be surprising. We saw laughter and tears
and hugs. These groups strengthened their friendships and created new
ones. When we focus on serving others, growth naturally happens within
us. And we think it happened tonight.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<h3>08.05.08 | Tuesday - The Sounds of New Orleans <br /></h3><p>For all
you praying for us: we need to thank you. Your prayers have worked!
Today was cloudy and breezy&mdash;and just under 90 degrees. That&rsquo;s cool for
New Orleans, and very welcome to all of us on a roof, painting siding,
and hammering 2x4s.</p><p>Work is how the day began&mdash;and the sound of
rousing New Orleans jazz is how it ended. Stories have come flowing in
from all areas, from the Upper Ninth Ward to the Vacation Bible School
(VBS). Here are a few from the work sites. </p><h4>Habitat Work Sites</h4>
<p><img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/habitat2-nola.jpg" alt="Habitat" hspace="10" width="250" height="171" align="right" />Before
much of the other work on a house can be done, the roof must go on. One
of our groups finished an entire roof today. The whole roof! (Can we
get a &ldquo;woot!&rdquo;?) Previous groups were too young to get on the roof, so
Habitat was very thankful we were here. </p><p>Another group arrived
at their site and were given a task: empty the makeshift dumpster full
of construction materials into the real dumpster. Without a thought,
30-40 people dove right in. After a few seconds they discovered rebar.
And rats. And roaches. And rotten food. They completed their task in
about 10 minutes. Rather than complaining, they talked about how this
experience was a great way to start the first day of work: to do the
lowliest of jobs with a light heart. Erin, one of the dumpster divers,
had been praying for God to show her humility on this trip. Just
another example of God showing up when we simply say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; </p><p>We&rsquo;ve
been introduced to some amazing people who are living here, too.
Yesterday, Mark, one of our team, met Harry, who has lived in Central
City for 40 years. When Katrina hit, his home was flooded&mdash;the waters
rose to just below the top of his front door, and sat there for two
weeks. He and his family were okay, but his home was nearly lost. Since
then, Harry has worked tirelessly to rebuild his house&mdash;all by himself.
Every day he drives 30 miles to and from New Orleans to work on his
home. This weekend, he&rsquo;s moving back into his home of 40 years. Our
crew is looking for ways to help him finish this week.</p><h4>Vacation Bible School</h4>
<p><img src="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/images/vbs-1.JPG" alt="VBS" hspace="10" width="250" height="139" align="left" />Over
60 kids, from grades 1-8 showed up for a morning of singing, crafting,
soccer, and learning about Jesus. These kids are wonderful. Some are
shy, some like to tell stories (tall ones of course), and some shared
with us what happened to them during Katrina. Seventh and 8th graders
were wonderful helpers to all of our volunteers. We are so grateful to
First Baptist New Orleans (FBNO) for generously giving us the run of
their entire church. The air conditioning is pretty nice, too.</p><p>Greeting
us on our first day here was Johnny, who works on the facilities of
FBNO. His smile is infectious and his hugs are fantastic. He&rsquo;s also a
survivor of and savior of many from Katrina. After Katrina, his
family&rsquo;s home was flooded, and they were trapped at their house. He
swam through the waters, past dead animals, a corpse, and sludge, and
found a boat, which he dragged back to his home. His family piled in to
the boat, and as they paddled, he swam in front to get them to safety.
He repeated his one-man rescue operation for about 20 families. When he
was done, and they pulled him out of the water, he passed out and had
to be airlifted to Atlanta for medical treatment. He says it's a
miracle he didn't die himself. Like most heroes, he is humble, and
doesn't tell this story with any arrogance. In fact, he hasn&rsquo;t wanted
to talk about his story for two years. We are so thankful that he&rsquo;s
opening up to us. We thank God for Johnny, and for enabling us to meet
him. </p><h4>New Orleans Jazz</h4><p>Preservation Hall is the pinnacle
of jazz here. Step inside and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve gone back to the early
1900s&mdash;maybe earlier. A former home, P-Hall was built in the 1850s. The
show goes on in the former drawing room of the home. Contrary to its
name, this place isn&rsquo;t preserved in the sense that it has modern
amenities. Just a few benches, exposed nails, fans (no a/c, so it&rsquo;s a
tad warm), and enough space to hear soul-stirring jazz. With a
rendition of it&rsquo;s a Wonderful World, the Preservation Hall jazz band
brought some to tears. And with the best version of &ldquo;When the Saints Go
Marching In&rdquo; that we&rsquo;ve ever heard, they brought us to our feet. Now
this is what New Orleans sounds like. Best of all, they told us that
they are moving back to their pre-Katrina schedule of jazz shows 7
nights a week, starting in September.</p><p>Rebirth is happening everywhere. We are so blessed to be a small part of it. </p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br /><h3>08.04.08 | Monday -- From Ruins to Rebirth</h3><br /><p>So
we heard that there&rsquo;s a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico headed for
Texas&hellip;and then we heard from some of our friends and family about the
rumor that there is a massive hurricane bearing down on us. Here&rsquo;s the
deal: we saw rain for about 15 minutes. That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re expecting. The
night is cool and breezy&mdash;and we&rsquo;re grateful for a break in the heat. So
if you were wondering&mdash;we&rsquo;re all good.</p>This morning we took the
Katrina tour of New Orleans. For 3 hours we drove through the areas
affected by the hurricane. That means we drove through all of New
Orleans. All of it. Not just the Ninth Ward or isolated areas you&rsquo;ve
heard about on the news. All of New Orleans shows scars from the storm.
That was the most startling part. Every neighborhood&mdash;upscale, working
class, poor&mdash;had homes, and lives destroyed. Many homes were not
destroyed by the hurricane but from canals and levees that burst and
allowed water to rush through neighborhoods. We saw empty lots where
houses used to be. Weeds 6 feet tall. Abandoned homes. We saw two holes
in one roof, caused by people who had to dig through the roof to save
their neighbors who had climbed to the attic to escape the rising
waters.<p>We saw the signs of hope, too. New homes with lots of
ornaments on the lawn proclaim that a family is back. Pink flowers
blooming in the front yards. Reconstruction is happening. It&rsquo;s slow and
uneven, but people are rebuilding. The only place that doesn&rsquo;t seem to
have been impacted is the French Quarter. It&rsquo;s the highest point in the
city, so it suffered mostly wind damage. Bourbon Street bustles with
tourists. (We know that because some of us went there. Some sang
karaoke. Some played the washboard with a Cajun band. It was very
G-rated.) </p><p>We knew before coming here that there was a lot of
work left to do. Today we felt it. So much of the U.S. has moved on
from Katrina (people here call it Katrina fatigue), and as one of our
tour guides said, people assume the city is rebuilt. It&rsquo;s not &ndash;it&rsquo;s in
the process of being rebuilt. If you&rsquo;ve ever thought to yourself, or
heard someone else say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of hearing about Katrina &ndash; that was
3 years ago,&rdquo; imagine what it&rsquo;s like to live in the aftermath of
Katrina. Every day. New Orleanians are tired, too.</p><p>Pastor Luter
spoke to us at lunch today and offered us hope. People who grew up
here, whose families grew up here, love this city, and they are very
grateful that we&rsquo;ve come to help. The love we&rsquo;ve been shown in amazing.
We hope to give it back big time. We did give one tangible thing today:
We presented a check for $20,000 to a local organization that
coordinates the home building projects for Habitat for Humanity. This
money, from Crossroads and the Cincinnati Habitat for Humanity Chapter,
is enough to sponsor one more home in New Orleans.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t
expect to fix every home, or solve the city&rsquo;s problems, but we&rsquo;re
expectant that God will make amazing things happen this week. </p><p>Tomorrow we get to work. We can&rsquo;t wait.   </p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * </p><h3>08.03.08 | Sunday &ndash; And it begins&hellip; </h3><p><br />After
16 hours, several truck stops, and countless hours of half-sleep later,
we&rsquo;re in New Orleans! We made it here in great time&mdash;early enough to
stop for breakfast and still make it to the church on time&hellip;</p><p>All 7
buses rolled into the city around 9:30 a.m., a perfect time to nab good
seats at Franklin Avenue Baptist Church, who has been helping us to
coordinate the vacation Bible school, and has provided lots of prayers.
The pews in the sanctuary were packed for the 10:30 service; their
overflow rooms also full. For FABC, this scenario was sweet. FABC has
been back in their church for only 4 months. After Hurricane Katrina,
the sanctuary sat under 9 feet of water. The hurricane changed their
world. Today Pastor Luter graciously welcomed us and blessed us, made
us feel welcome. And he celebrated the fact that they are back in their
church. With his lively, invigorating message about Jesus&rsquo; desire to be
our friend, no matter what we&rsquo;ve been through, even the most haggard
among us couldn&rsquo;t doze off. He brought the funny, too. It was electric.
</p><p>After celebrating with our friends, we checked into the hotel.
For the next few hours, some napped, some dove in the pool, some
explored the city. We all craved showers. Not so sure that everyone has
showered yet though&hellip; here&rsquo;s hoping that will happen by tomorrow&hellip;. </p><p>We&rsquo;re
all tired, but eager for the week to start. New Orleans is hot&mdash;its
dense humidity powerful. Life teems from this city, and we can&rsquo;t wait
to get our hands dirty. </p><p>Tomorrow we tour the Lower Ninth and
Upper Ninth Wards, to see the parts of the city heavily impacted by the
city&mdash;and where the majority of our team will be building. And we&rsquo;ll set
up for vacation Bible school. </p><p>Now we sleep. Finally. </p>
