	<h2>Thank You</h2><strong>You have been signed up as a host!</strong><br /><br />We'll start the really big push for the Reset journey in late January. Watch for communication on how to post details about the small group you want to host, and don't be discouraged if no one signs up for your group right away. Most people will start looking for a group in early February, and quite a few last-minute folks will sign up for a group right before the Reset journey starts on February 21.
