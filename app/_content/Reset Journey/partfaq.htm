<p class="noPspace"><strong>What is a journey?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">A community-wide journey focuses the entire church on one topic for approximately six weeks. Everyone&mdash;from kids to the old folks&mdash;is on the same page, learning about the same topics and growing in similar ways. A journey consists of three parts: the weekend message, individual study and small group interaction. For the six weeks of the journey (beginning February 21), it is the main thing. Everything else shuts down. Everyone participates. Everyone is challenged.</p>

<p id="3" class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>How can I get into a small group?</strong><br />There are all kinds of ways to find a small group for Reset. Here are just a few ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider asking a group of friends or people with whom you serve to form a small group, or try the Find A Small Group tool (available beginning January 31) to get connected with small group hosts looking for people to join their group. The online tool will enable you to specify the kind of group you&rsquo;re looking for and the area of town you&rsquo;d like to meet.</li>
<li>Attend a Connect Event on Sunday, February 22 to meet other people looking to get connected to a group. Mason Connect Events will happen immediately after each service on February 22. Oakley&rsquo;s Connect Event will take place that evening at 7:30pm in the Meeting Center.</li>
<li>Join an onsite group that will meet on all six Wednesday nights of the journey. There will be groups for men, women and couples, as well as an open group. You can also try Pursuit, a 20-somethings ministry held at Crossroads Oakley on Thursday nights at 7pm. Pursuit is listed as a group on the Find A Small Group tool online. </li>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>I&rsquo;ve heard this series is about Jesus, and I don&rsquo;t consider myself a believer. Should I participate in Reset?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Absolutely. We welcome people from all different places of their spiritual journey. You will be asked in this series to read from the Bible and work on some homework assignments, but your questions and concerns are welcome and expected. Just know your host may not have all the answers, but we are willing to help in any way we can.</p>

<p id="5" class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about the whole God thing.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We all have doubts, questions and assumptions we&rsquo;ve made about Jesus, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re doing the Reset journey. Together, we&rsquo;ll investigate the life and claims of a real person whose influence on history was so monumental that we date time after him, and we won&rsquo;t make any assumptions about what people believe. And, hey, it&rsquo;s only six weeks.</p>

<p id="6" class="noPspace"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong>Is this just a trick to get me into Crossroads?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">No. Reset is not just a Crossroads thing. 50 other churches are participating in the Reset journey, and <a title="Reset Partner Churches" href="/reset/partners.htm">you can check out any church you want</a>. The weekend messages will be on the same themes, and the individual materials and group content will be exactly the same.</p>

<p id="7" class="noPspace"><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong>I don&rsquo;t like organized religion/have had a bad experience with church.</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">You&rsquo;re not alone. Many of us feel the same way. It could be a surprising, or really healing experience, though, to keep an open mind and check out <a title="Reset Partner Churches" href="/reset/partners.htm">one of the participating church communities</a> for six weeks. But if you really don&rsquo;t want to venture into a &ldquo;church,&rdquo; then don&rsquo;t. But don&rsquo;t let that stop you from participating in Reset. We&rsquo;ll post videos of the weekend messages online at <a title="Reset" href="/reset">crossroads.net/reset</a> every Monday by noon, so if you prefer to listen while sitting on the couch in your pajamas, you can be just as prepared for your small group meeting as everyone else.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong>I&rsquo;m already in a small group. Are we going to be asked to split up for Reset?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">For Reset, we strongly encourage you to expand your group (to no more than 12 people), or to consider breaking up. Given the topic of this year&rsquo;s journey, the number of people who are not in a small group currently, and the need for hosts, we&rsquo;d love for you to consider having your current group split, either temporarily or permanently, for the sake of reproduction. Consider the dynamics of your group and what you feel God is calling you to do.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>I&rsquo;ll need to miss a small group meeting. Can I still be in a small group?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Of course. Just let your small group host know in advance when you won&rsquo;t be able to attend.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="#1">return to top</a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p id="10" class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>If I miss a weekend service during the series, can I still be in the group?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Sure! Our weekend messages are posted online so you can catch up if you have to miss. The weekend experience is a large component in the journey, but it is just one of three important components. The materials we provide and the small group experience will be of great benefit, even on the weeks you have to miss.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What materials do I need for Reset?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Personal guides will be available at Crossroads on the first weekend of the Reset series, February 21 and 22. Electronic (PDF) versions of the guide will also be available online. You&rsquo;ll also want to get your hands on a Bible for the series. You can pick one up for free at the Info Center. Your host will also provide group materials, including a DVD.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>I&rsquo;ve got more questions. What should I do?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">First of all, relax. We&rsquo;re here to help. You can stop by the kiosk before and after services, or just <a title="reset journey email" href="/mysend/119">send us an e-mail.</a></p>
