<p class="noPspace">Help build more intimate communities for people who come to Crossroads, so they get more than just the weekend experience. Hosting a Small Group means you invite people to your house (or a diner, atrium, field, stream, wherever), and then you help get people to talk, share their stories and opinions, and pray. <a title="sign up to host" href="/my/Serve/SmallGroups/SmallGroupHosts.htm">Click here to sign up as a Small Group Host.</a></p>
