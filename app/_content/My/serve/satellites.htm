<span class="header">Multi-Site Strategy</span><br>Reaching our friends where they are</h2>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">We want to reach friends who've given up on “church,” but not on God.</span><br><br>To do that, we want to provide open seats, optimal times and ideal locations for our friends to hear a relevant message and find community. That’s the idea behind our multi-site plan: <strong>to grow communities with a unified vision, close to our own homes</strong>. Then people can spend more time connecting with each other and less time driving alone in their cars, or just not going to church at all.<br><br>Not only that, but as we grow in other communities, <strong>we can mobilize one unified team</strong>, ready to change the face of our region for the Kingdom.<br><br>Crossroads’ new sites will not be separate churches, just other locations to experience Crossroads. We will operate as one church with one senior pastor, one board of directors, one bank account, one staff and the same message each weekend. <strong>One church, multiple locations.</strong><br><br><strong>Message: </strong><em>Senior Pastor Brian Tome talks about our vision behind multi-site:</em><strong> <a title="Brian Tome message" href="http://www.crossroads.net/players/media/hq/I_AM_4_Reproduced_04-27-08_Tome_webaudio.mp3">Download and listen </a></strong>(mp3)<br><strong><br></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Our latest site is Crossroads Mason. Our next site could be in Anderson.</strong></h3>
<p class="noPspace">Services in Mason take place on Sunday, showing the message from Crossroads Oakley from the night before (via DVD on some very large screens). Everything else is live—Kids’ Club, First Impressions, the music and, of course, the coffee. Crossroads Mason has its own pastor available to connect with people each weekend, and Anderson will be no different.<br><br></p>
<h3> FAQ about Crossroads Anderson and the Multi-site Strategy:</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><br>Aren’t there plenty of other churches in Anderson? Is this part of Crossroads’ plot for world domination?</strong><br>Yes, there are plenty of good churches in the area already who are reaching people. We are trying to reach people who  aren’t attending church. Opening a Crossroads in Anderson enables people to invite friends in their neighborhood who aren’t willing to drive 30 minutes or more to check out Crossroads in Oakley. We also did a lot of research (it wasn’t just pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey). <br><br><strong>Why show the message on a video screen? Isn’t that a little creepy?</strong><br>Yeah, it sounds a little strange, but even in the Oakley auditorium most people watch the speaker on screen—not the speaker on stage. Plus, it ensures everyone hears the same message regardless of location. We also may utlilize live teaching on occasion, to keep you on your toes.<br><br><strong>What if I live in Anderson and I really like the excuse to be nearby Dewey's on the weekend?</strong><br>Well, then knock yourself out. If you live in the Anderson area, of course you’re welcome to stay at Crossroads Oakley. But consider that having a Crossroads location closer to your home will make it easier for you to invite friends in your community. Plus, with the 30 minutes or more  of drive time you’ll gain every weeekend, you could start serving in a role at Crossroads, or learn something new, like Morse code.<br><br><strong>Who is paying for this?</strong><br>Crossroads Anderson will operate from Crossroads’ ministry fund. This location, along with any other  future locations, will be funded like any other ministry at Crossroads. We will budget according to the vision God’s given us, and then trust that he will provide the funds. Some money has already been allocated to the Anderson location through our ministry fund.<br><br><strong>Are you looking at other places?</strong><br>Next up is Crossroads International Space Station, or maybe Crossroads Bali—somewhere with a beach. Seriously, our goal is for everyone in the region to hear a consistent, relevant message at a place with similar values, in an optimal location, while keeping seats open at the Oakley location. We’ll also ask God and people around Crossroads where the next sites should be. So, the next campus could be in any number of places, depending on where leaders step forward. We’ll take it one at a time. (But if you have a spare warehouse you want to donate, <a title="Email Us" href="http://www.crossroads.net/mysend/27">let’s talk</a>.)<br><strong><br>Will there  be staff dedicated to Crossroads Anderson?</strong><br>Yes, and they are part of the overall Crossroads staff team that works in Oakley. We'll start with one campus pastor dedicated to Anderson, and over time we'll hire more people to meet needs such as weekend experiences and Kids' Club. Eventually, some staff may be housed closer to our other locations.</p>	 </div></body></html>
