<h2>Pastoral Care</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">We believe in looking after each other. <br></span><br><span class="normal">The way we see Pastoral Care is like community caretaking plus triage. We rely on the small communities we can build around ourselves to be our main support. But we also have a need for volunteers whose gifts include a capacity to listen, pray, celebrate weddings, suggest referrals, visit the sick or help intervene during crises.</span></p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"><strong>Wedding Team</strong></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">We love to help couples who are getting married in the Crossroads Chapel.  Our team helps with logistics, music, a/v and anything else a couple might need for their rehearsal and wedding. Email<a href="/mysend/287" target="_blank"> Emily Shinkle</a> or call 513.731.7400 x1380 to receive more information or to sign up.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace"><strong>Build into Marriages</strong></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">We’re looking for married couples who are passionate about marriage, and that would love to build into other married couples. It doesn’t matter how long you have been married or how many times. <a style="line-height: 1;" title="marriage volunteer form" href="/uploadedfiles/marriageform_enabled.pdf">SIGN UP</a></p>

<p class="normal noPspace"><strong>Prayer Team Volunteer Roles</strong></p>
<p class="normal noPspace">A few things to know before joining the prayer team:</p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1;">–If you’re still trying to figure out who Jesus is, great! We’re glad you’re a part of Crossroads but the prayer team probably isn’t the place for you.</span></p>
<p class="normal noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1;">–The prayer team involves a higher commitment than most serving teams around here. We encourage people to serve for about six months in another role, before joining many of our teams.</span></p>
<p class="normal noPspace"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace"><strong>Weekend Prayer</strong></p>
<address class="normal">There is a Weekend Prayer Team at each site. This team is passionate about what happens on the weekend and is excited about supporting that with prayer. When this team prays with others, we make no assumptions of where people are at spiritually, so we pray using simple, everyday language. We want to model that prayer is just talking to God like you would talk to anyone else.</address>
<address class="normal">Serving requirement: six months previous serving, two to four services/month. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/crossroads.net/forms/d/1RexEm2nccEc4C1BatjJAvVSCX2cXh9GRt9NkKi3PYPw/viewform" target="_blank">SIGN UP<strong> </strong></a>

<!-- Visitation Teams We’re never sure when or how often "visitors" will be called upon (because we encourage Small Groups and friends to be the #1 support system), but we do need people who have calm and uplifting spirits to make visits to hospitals, prisons and shut-ins. Please let us know if you want to be on the roster. <br /><a href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=VisitationTeam" mce_href="http://www.crossroads.net/my/serve/signUp.php?form=VisitationTeam">SIGN UP </a><br /><br />-->	 </div>
