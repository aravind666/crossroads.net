<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><strong class="first">Help people experience God, often for the first time. </strong><br><br>Not everything happens under spotlight. Think Emerald City and a bunch of tiny wizards. Wizards who count beans, unlock computers and stuff communion bags so that every person who sits down in the auditorium can decide if they’re ready to experience God and then get to. Think about <em>that </em>wizard.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="sectionHeader">Weekday Behind the Scenes<br></span></p>
<p class="noPspace">There are ongoing teams needed throughout the year. This may support some of the prep week leading up to a weekend service, stuffing, printing, collating, etc. Jack of all trades are welcome here and the work is important. These projects typically take place Monday – Friday (9am–4pm) at all three sites. <a href="/my/signup/2002980" target="_blank">SIGN UP. </a></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Though small in number, these volunteers deal with the big green. Some meet monthly to literally count bills; others, with financial expertise, consult people on budgeting, getting out of debt and how we can follow God’s plan while managing our money. (OK, and it probably goes without saying that we need to see your track record first. If it includes strange bouts of gambling…well.) <a href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=financeTeam">SIGN UP</a>.<br><br></p>
<h3>Information Technology</h3>
<p class="noPspace">We have teams focused on web development, quality assurance, and a weekend support and projects team that does a little bit of everything. You get to impact tons of ministries and individuals, plus you get to help shape the future of Crossroads. It’s flex hours and flex commitment, so give it a trial run and see what’s there for you. <a title="Sign Up To Serve In IT" href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=itTeam">SIGN UP.</a><br><br></p>	 </div></body></html>
