<p class="header noPspace">Multi-Site Strategy</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">We want to reach friends who’ve given up on “church” but not on God.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">To do that, we want to provide open seats, optimal times and ideal locations for our friends to hear a relevant message and find community. That’s the idea behind our multi-site plan: <strong>to grow communities with a unified vision, close to our own homes</strong>. And as we grow in other communities, <strong>we can mobilize one unified team</strong>, ready to change the face of our region for the Kingdom.<br><br>Crossroads’ new sites will not be separate churches—just other locations to experience God through the unique personality of Crossroads. We will operate as one church with one senior pastor, one board of directors, one bank account, one staff and the same message each weekend.<br><span class="sectionHeader"><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="sectionHeader"> FAQ about Crossroads’ Multi-Site Strategy:</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Where is the next site and when will it open?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Crossroads West Side, located in the former Three Rivers Middle School building at 8575 Bridgetown Road, will open in early 2014. We are also working toward a site in Mason and future plans have been addressed below. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Do we own the West Side building?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yes, we purchased the middle school and are retrofitting it to work as a Crossroads location. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Who is the pastor?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Brian Tome is Crossroads’ senior pastor. Greg McElfresh is the campus pastor for Crossroads West Side. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I live in/near the west side and want to be involved. What can I do now?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">You can also sign up for future updates on Crossroads West Side by joining the interest list at <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/westside" target="_blank">crossroads.net/westside</a>.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What happened to Crossroads Anderson as the next site?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We had an agreement in principle to lease a property, but the agreement fell through, and currently there are no available properties in Anderson that meet the needs for a Crossroads location. We are saddened that the original site didn’t work out, and we’re sorry for any disappointment folks in Anderson might feel as a result. You can be a part of the Anderson Community Group by going to <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/anderson" target="_blank">crossroads.net/anderson</a>.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I </strong><strong>see tons of nearly vacant strip malls on Beechmont. Why can’t we use one?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We conducted an exhaustive search of real estate in Anderson and concluded that the sites currently available are too small, too complicated to reconfigure, too lengthy to execute and too expensive to demolish and build. While we would love to be in Anderson, we are not willing to do so at any cost. If the right property becomes available, we would eagerly consider it. Meanwhile, we continue to look for other locations on the East side of town, as well as in other parts of Cincinnati that are about a 20-minute drive (or more) from current Crossroads locations.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Are you looking at other places?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yes, we are currently pursuing a fourth location in Mason and we are slated to open in November of 2014. Mark Stecher is the campus pastor in Mason. Our goal is for everyone in the region to hear a consistent, relevant message at a place with similar values, in an optimal location, while keeping seats open at the Oakley location during prime times. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Aren’t there plenty of other churches around? Is this multi-site strategy part of Crossroads’ plot for world domination?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">There are plenty of good churches in the Cincinnati area who are reaching people. We are trying to reach people who aren’t attending church. Opening a Crossroads location in a new area of the city enables people to invite friends in their neighborhood who aren’t willing to drive 20 minutes or more to check out Crossroads in one of its current locations.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I heard you show the message on a video screen at other sites. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yes, and it’s been working well in Florence and Mason. Plus, it ensures everyone hears the same message regardless of location. We also may utilize live teaching on occasion, to keep you on your toes.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Who is paying for this?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Construction of new locations will be funded by Crossroads’ Game Change Campaign. Ongoing, all locations will be funded like any other ministry at Crossroads. We will budget according to the vision God’s given us, and then trust that he will provide the funds.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Will there be staff dedicated to new Crossroads locations?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yes, and just like at Florence, Mason and West Side, they will be part of the overall Crossroads staff team. We’ll start with one campus pastor dedicated to each new location, and then we’ll hire more people to meet needs such as weekend experiences and Kids’ Club. Eventually, some staff may be housed closer to our other locations rather than at Oakley.</p>	 </div></body></html>
