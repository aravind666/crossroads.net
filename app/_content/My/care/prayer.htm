<h2>Prayer at Crossroads</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">We absolutely believe in the power of prayer.</span><br><br>Whether you want to receive prayer or pray for others, there are several ways to get involved with prayer at Crossroads:</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<a title="Prayer Requests" href="/about/prayerRequest.php">Send us a prayer request via email</a>.</h3>
<p class="noPspace">We’re ready to hear from you, and we’ll keep it confidential. If you have an urgent need, please call 513.731.7400 (during work hours) so we can find someone for you to talk to.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Receive one-on-one prayer after the weekend service.</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Simply stay in your seat after the service is over, and a member of our Prayer Team will ask to pray with you.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Schedule a listening appointment.</h3>
<p class="noPspace">During this hour long session, a member of our Pastoral Care team will listen to you and provide a safe place to process whatever you’re going through. If you’d like them to, they are also able to pray for you during that session. Please <a title="Dan Email" href="/mysend/273">email us</a> to make an appointment. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Join the Prayer Team.</h3>
<p class="noPspace">If you have a heart for prayer, are actively following Jesus and have served somewhere at Crossroads for at least six months, we’d love to talk to you about joining the Prayer Team. <a title="Email Prayer Team" href="/send/22">Just shoot us an email</a>.</p>

<h3>Learn more about prayer.</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Prayer is more than just putting the right words together. It’s about having a relationship with God. We’ve put together a six-week study that tackles some of the preconceived notions you might have about prayer, and provides you with challenges to take you deeper into your prayer or to get you to pray for the first time. <a title="Prayer Study" href="/images/uploadedImages/PrayerStudy.pdf">Download the guide.</a></p>	   </div>
