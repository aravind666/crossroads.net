<h2>Funerals</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">We are ready to help you.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">The death of a family member is a significant loss. We would love to help prepare a service of remembrance for the loved ones of regular Crossroads attenders and their immediate families.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">If your plans include scheduling services with a funeral home, please contact us BEFORE any plans are finalized with them so that we can guarantee a pastor for you. Crossroads’ chapel is available for funerals and memorial services at no cost. We can seat around 250 comfortably.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Contact our Pastoral Care Coordinator at 513.731.7400 x1727 for more information and to schedule a pastor to meet with you to discuss your needs and make service arrangements.</p>	   </div></body></html>
