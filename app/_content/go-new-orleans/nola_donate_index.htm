<span class="first">In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devasted a community that was already struggling.</span><br><img style="margin: 5px" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/content/NOLA_home.jpg" alt="" width="158" height="119" align="left"><br><div>At that time, Crossroads sent $150,000 and a truckload of donated supplies to the Gulf Region.  Over the last two years, we've sent hundreds of people, and some amazing things have happened. But, they still need our help. So in July 2010, 400<strong> people will GO to New Orleans</strong> and do everything they can to be a blessing, to give people hope and a place to call home again. We will build homes under the direction of Habitat for Humanity in the Upper Ninth Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. We will also host a Vacation Bible School with one of our partner churches in New Orleans to serve kids from families that have been displaced by the hurricane.<br><br>Each GO New Orleans participant must raise their own funds in order to go. You can support someone by making an online donation today. </div>		</body></html>
