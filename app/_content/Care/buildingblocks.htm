<h2>Building Blocks for Marriage</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Build a strong foundation for your marriage based on biblical principles.</span><br />&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.75;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p class="noPspace">We believe that an essential part of the premarital process is to understand and learn as much about yourself and your future spouse as possible, and to build relationship skills. This involves discovering what you have in common, uncovering areas where you differ and learning how to be a thriving couple amid those differences. Research and experience show that couples have an improved first several years of marriage when they invest in skill building BEFORE they wed. (It&rsquo;s like learning to drive before you hop in the car.)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Building Blocks for Marriage classes are held at Crossroads Oakley four times a year: Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer. They focus on skill building, relationships and stories of married couples&rsquo; lives. The classes are held on four consecutive Saturdays, which include one full-day class and three half-day classes. The topics covered include: personalities, family heritage, biblical marriage, prayer, communication, love languages, sex, conflict resolution and forgiveness. The classes are a combination of large group teaching, small group discussion facilitated by a married couple, and one-on-one time with your future spouse.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Please note: Building Blocks for Marriage is a stand-alone class and attending it does not indicate that you are in the Crossroads premarital process.&nbsp;In fact, about&nbsp;half&nbsp;the couples that take Building Blocks don&rsquo;t get married at Crossroads or by a Crossroads pastor. If you&rsquo;re interested in using a Crossroads marrying pastor and/or the Crossroads Oakley Chapel for your ceremony, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:weddings@crossroads.net" target="_blank">weddings@crossroads.net</a>&nbsp;to check your date or get started&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/crossroads.net/forms/d/153CRLkwVeSFdPhF0h542d_mg3DMy6Rsj4GXcp_65Bjg/edit" target="_blank">by clicking here to fill out the online form.</a></div>
