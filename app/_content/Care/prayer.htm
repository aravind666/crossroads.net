<p class="noPspace">We&#8217;re ready to hear from you, and we&#8217;ll keep it confidential. If you have an urgent need after hours, please call 513.731.7400 x8101.&#160;</p>

<p class="noPspace">If you have a heart for prayer, are actively following Jesus and have served somewhere at Crossroads for at least six months, we&#8217;d love to talk to you about joining the Prayer Team. <a title="Email Prayer Team" href="">Just shoot us an email</a>.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>Learn more about prayer.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Prayer is more than just putting the right words together. It&#8217;s about having a relationship with God. We&#8217;ve put together a six-week study that tackles some of the preconceived notions you might have about prayer, and provides you with challenges to take you deeper into your prayer or to get you to pray for the first time. <a title="Prayer Study" href="">Download the guide</a>.</p>
