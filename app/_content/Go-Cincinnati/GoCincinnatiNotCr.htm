<p class="noPspace"><strong>Monday, May 6 at 5pm was our sign up deadline. We currently have enough volunteers at this time. If you did sign up, you&#8217;ll receive an email between May 10-15 confirming all details.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>We love Cincinnati. (All of it.)</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">And that love extends way beyond the city limits&#8212;we&#8217;re spreading it from Burlington to Middletown and all the neighborhoods in between. <strong>We call it GO Cincinnati</strong> because we take on projects all over the region. And let&#8217;s face it, GO Flomasoak doesn&#8217;t really flow off the tongue. So GO Cincinnati it is, and this is how we do it: a one-day compassion blitz, investing our love into hundreds of work projects all over town.&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">In 2012, 6,000 of us from 50 churches got dirty and sweaty, with paint-splattered hands and mulch-stained shirts, at one of hundreds of projects. And while all the projects were different, one similarity stood out: everyone helped bring hope and life to something that previously seemed hopeless and lifeless. New flowers replaced weeds. Vibrant murals covered dirty walls.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>This year, we&#8217;ll GO bigger and better than ever on Saturday, May 18, 9am-1pm. Will you?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
