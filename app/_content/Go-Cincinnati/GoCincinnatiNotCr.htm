<p class="noPspace"><strong>Monday, May 6 at 5pm was our sign up deadline. We currently have enough volunteers at this time. If you did sign up, you’ll receive an email between May 10-15 confirming all details.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>We love Cincinnati. (All of it.)</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">And that love extends way beyond the city limits—we’re spreading it from Burlington to Middletown and all the neighborhoods in between. <strong>We call it GO Cincinnati</strong> because we take on projects all over the region. And let’s face it, GO Flomasoak doesn’t really flow off the tongue. So GO Cincinnati it is, and this is how we do it: a one-day compassion blitz, investing our love into hundreds of work projects all over town. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">In 2012, 6,000 of us from 50 churches got dirty and sweaty, with paint-splattered hands and mulch-stained shirts, at one of hundreds of projects. And while all the projects were different, one similarity stood out: everyone helped bring hope and life to something that previously seemed hopeless and lifeless. New flowers replaced weeds. Vibrant murals covered dirty walls.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>This year, we’ll GO bigger and better than ever on Saturday, May 18, 9am-1pm. Will you?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you have a friend who is officially leading a project (GO Cincinnati project leaders are called Team Captains) and want to be on their team simply answer “Yes” to the question on the sign up form “Are you serving with a group” and select their name from the list of “Group Connector” names that pop up. You’ll receive an email between May 10-15 confirming all details.</p>
