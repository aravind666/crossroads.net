<br><br><span class="first">Start here with questions about GO Cincinnati.</span>
<br><br><strong>What if I want to serve on a project with my friends, my Reset group or my family?</strong>
<br>Great. We love groups. Just follow these 5 easy steps:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Talk to your friends and family, and decide who will be in your group.</li>
    <li>Pick a first, second and third choice of project type that works for everyone.
        We try to make projects kid-friendly but if you're not sure your kids would have fun helping, you might want to make other arrangements for them that day. &#160;</li>
    <li>Pick one member of the group to be your Group Connector (and make sure everyone knows who that is).</li>
    <li>The person named as Group Connector should sign up first, answer "yes" to the question "Are you serving with a group?", name themselves as Group Connector and pick the group's first, second and third choice of project type.</li>
    <li>Everyone in the group then signs up, also answering "yes" to the question "Are you serving with a group?" and then selects the Group Connector's name from a list of possible choices.</li>
</ol>
<strong><br>What if I have a friend who is leading a project?</strong><br>Answer "yes" to "are you serving with a group?" and select their name from the list of Group Connector names, and you'll be placed on their team.<br><br><strong>Should each member of our family sign up separately?</strong><br>No. Just one sign-up per family if you'd all like to serve on the same project, please.<br><br><strong>What about my kids? Can they serve with me?</strong><br>Sure, just choose a project that's age-appropriate. Here's a list of project types and the ages that are OK:<br><ul>
<li>Artistic Painting &#8211; children 13 and older</li>
<li>Construction &#8211; children 13 and older</li>

<strong><br>Are there any projects for people with physical limitations? </strong><br>Almost all projects involve physical work but a limited few do not. <a href="" title="Email GO Cincinnati">E-mail us</a> and we'll let you know some options.<br><br><strong>How do I know what project I'm assigned to after I sign up? </strong><br>You'll receive an e-mail the week before the event, but not before, so please don't ask.
