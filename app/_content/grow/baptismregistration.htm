<p class="noPspace">Baptism is a huge decision in the life of a Christ follower. We want to make sure that you understand your decision as fully as possible. The following steps are designed to guide you through your decision, and to provide us with the information we need to help you have a great experience.</p>

<p class="noPspace">To get started, please <a title="baptism study" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/documents/0511_adultbaptismpacket.pdf">click here</a> to go through the Baptism Study. Then if you are ready to be baptized, click on the appropriate Crossroads site, and submit the registration and personal story forms.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><em>We always like to share what God is doing in our community. In the event we publish your story, we&#8217;ll edit out names, correct grammatical errors, etc. It&#8217;s such a great way to speak to others who may hear a prompting from God, as you have, to be baptized. Thanks for sharing your story with us.</em></p>
