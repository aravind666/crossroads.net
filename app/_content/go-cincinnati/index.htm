<p class="subheading noPspace">Sign up to join a volunteer revolution on May 17.&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace">We love Cincinnati. (All of it.)</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">For the last eight years an army of volunteers has impacted Cincinnati through service projects in a one-day, citywide blitz of compassion. We show love to hundreds of schools, churches, neighborhoods, social agencies and non-profits to put our faith in action and to say thank you for the work they do in our community.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>We call it GO Cincinnati.</strong>&#160;We take on projects all over the region, from Middletown to Burlington and all places in between. And let&#8217;s face it, GO Flomasonoakwesteastside doesn&#8217;t really flow off the tongue.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">It&#8217;s year nine and on&#160;<strong>Saturday, May 17, 9am-1pm,</strong>&#160;we&#8217;re tackling over&#160;<strong>450 projects.</strong>&#160;We need&#160;<strong>8000 volunteers</strong>&#160;to help on teams across Crossroads East Side, Florence, Mason, Oakley and West Side. We have leaders and the materials for each project&#8212;we just need you!</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace" dir="ltr">How to Sign Up</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">1. Read the instructions below first.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">2.<strong>&#160;<a href="/gocincinnati/actions/signup/volunteers/">Click here</a></strong>&#160;after you have read the instructions below.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">3. Don&#8217;t sign up until you read the instructions below (they&#8217;re kind of important).</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace" dir="ltr">Sign Up Instructions</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Does everyone sign up separately?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">An adult signs up for themselves if they are single or for their family who all want to serve together.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What if I have a friend who is officially leading a project (we call GO Cincinnati project leaders Team Captains) and my family and I want to be on their team?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Simply answer &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the question on the sign up form &#8220;Are you serving with a group&#8221; and select their name from the list of &#8220;Group Connector&#8221; names that pop up and you&#8217;ll be placed on their team.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What if I don&#8217;t know a leader but want to serve on a project with my fianc&#233;, friends, small group, journey group, or synchronized swimming team?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Great. We love groups.&#160;Just follow these 5 easy steps:</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><strong>1. Talk to your friends and family</strong>&#160;and find out who&#8217;d like to serve together and the ages of their kids.</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><strong>2. Decide what type of project you&#8217;d like to serve on.</strong>&#160;Pick a first, second and third choice of project type that works for everyone. Some project types are more kid-friendly than others. If you&#8217;re not sure your kids would have fun or will help out, you might want to make other arrangements for them that day so you can serve the project to the fullest.</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 60px;" dir="ltr"><strong>Project types and age limits are:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 60px;" dir="ltr">Artistic Painting &#8211; children 13 and older OK</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 60px;" dir="ltr">Construction &#8211; children 13 and older OK</p>

<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><strong>3. Pick the name of one member of the group</strong>&#160;of friends who want to serve together as your Group Connector - a name that everyone in your group will select when signing up to let us know that you want to serve together.</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><strong>4. The person named as Group Connector signs up for themselves if they are single or for their family first,</strong>&#160;answers &#8220;yes&#8221; to the question &#8220;Are you serving with a group?&#8221;, names themselves as Group Connector and picks the group&#8217;s first, second and third choice of project type.</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><strong>5. Everyone else who wants to serve together then signs up,</strong>&#160;also answering &#8220;yes&#8221; to the question &#8220;Are you serving with a group?&#8221; and then selects the Group Connector&#8217;s name from a list of possible choices.</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr">It takes a bit of communication up front but it works!</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>How do I know what project I&#8217;m assigned to after I sign up?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You&#8217;ll receive an email before the event giving you all of the details about your project. We&#8217;ll email you between May 9 and May 12 but not before so please don&#8217;t ask.</p>
