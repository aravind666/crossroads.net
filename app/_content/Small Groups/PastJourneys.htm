<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="Free" href="/free">Free</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">We might not be as free as we think we are. Even worse, we may have been duped into believing that a "balanced" life is the key to happiness (nope) or that a relationship with God is about layering on rules and restrictions (it's not). The Bible says that "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." Not fear. Not guilt. Not morality. Not even religion. Freedom.</p>

<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="Reset" href="/reset">Reset</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Let&rsquo;s hit the reset button, or begin for the first time to discover our own beliefs about the most influential person in history. Let&rsquo;s unclutter our assumptions of Jesus, go deeper than pop spirituality and push through the stained-glass sound bytes. Let&rsquo;s meet&mdash;or re-meet&mdash;the God who got dirty with the world. The man people ran to, and ran from. The man who captained boats, ate meals with crooks and call girls, threw hillside parties, made kings panic. The man who brought the world an outlandish message and then said, follow me.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Bombarded with the promises of savvy marketers and easy credit, we&rsquo;re offered beauty, significance, security and happiness in just six easy installments and low, low monthly payments. In the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, we often feel like we never have enough. But there&rsquo;s another way. There&rsquo;s freedom to be had in a more open-handed approach to our time, money and possessions. In that freedom, we can discover what it means to be consumed with the One who designed us to be so much more than a cog in a consumer-driven economy. And that will change everything.<br /><br /><a title="Consumed Guide (PDF)" href="/images/uploadedImages/Journey%20Materials/Consumed/Consumed_Guide.pdf">Click here</a> to download the guide.

<p class="noPspace"><span class="sectionHeader">Kingdom </span></p>
<p class="noPspace">Jesus didn&rsquo;t come to bring a new religion. He came to start a revolution. He called it the &ldquo;Kingdom of God,&rdquo; and he said that it operates in a totally different way than the world we see around us. It&rsquo;s radical. It&rsquo;s counterintuitive. It&rsquo;s an alternative way of doing life based on receiving love from God and living out of sacrificial love for others. This revolution is advancing and unstoppable, and we are invited to play a significant role in it. Join us in February and March as we experiment with this revolutionary Kingdom by applying the teachings of Jesus in tangible ways.<br /><br /><a href="/images/uploadedImages/KingdomGuide.pdf">Click here</a> to download the guide.

<p class="noPspace">&ldquo;You should make more.&rdquo; &ldquo;You should do more.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like your mother.&rdquo; Simple statements like these have crossed our radar and managed to become a part of our identity. But what if those statements you&rsquo;ve embraced as your identity are actually lies? Consider the decisions you make and the dreams you discard because you believe the lies. Consider the freedom to be who you were created to be. What if God loves you as he made you and you have tons to offer? That just might change things.<br /><br />Download the<a href="/images/uploadedImages/iDGuide.pdf"> individual study guide</a> and the <a title="id small group experience" href="/images/uploadedImages/iD.pdf">small group materials</a>.
