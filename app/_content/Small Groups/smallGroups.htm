<p class="subheading noPspace">We believe small communities can have a big impact on your life.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Small Groups are just that&mdash;gatherings of six, ten or so&mdash;for getting comfortable, investing in one another, changing. Some small groups discuss books. Some choose to study the Bible or serve together. Others desire simply to know each other better and share their lives. We provide groups with some resources, but what they do and when they meet is up to the group.</p>
