<h2>Give To Crossroads</h2>
<p class="noPspace">We follow three core principles in the handling of money: (1) <strong>bless people</strong>, (2) <strong>base our budget on what we think God wants, not on what we think we&#8217;ll get</strong> and (3) <strong>money is a tool for a church to use and therefore should be spent, not saved</strong>. (We believe these things strike at the heart of how God wants money to be used, as seen in the Bible.) <br><br></p>
