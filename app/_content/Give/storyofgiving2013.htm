<div class="subheading">2013 was unheard-of</div>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Last year was like climbing the biggest mountain we&rsquo;ve ever faced. It was exhausting, energizing, uncertain and wonderful, and now we can look back at the amazing numbers and life change that took place.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">2014. This year means more. More freedom, more healing, more people connected with the God who loves and pursues them. This looks like a West Side location in the spring, a brand new building in Mason this fall, and experiments all over town in places like UC and the East Side. It&rsquo;s gonna be sweet.&nbsp;</span></p>
