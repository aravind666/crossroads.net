<p class="header noPspace">Financial Philosophy</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Many believe the Bible says &ldquo;money is the root of all evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Not true. What it actually says is &ldquo;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&hellip;&rdquo; (1 Timothy 6:10). Well, we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;love&rdquo; it, we just &ldquo;like it as a friend.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s how finances work at Crossroads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generous people in our community love contributing to the things they see God doing around here. So they give, and <strong>we use that money to bless others</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>We base our budget on what we believe God wants</strong>, not on what we think we&rsquo;ll get.</li>
<li><strong>Money gets spent here, not stashed</strong>. People give to Crossroads so we can build into the community, not a mutual fund.</li>
</ol>
