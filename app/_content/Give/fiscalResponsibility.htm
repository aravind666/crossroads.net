<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If you do not currently pay off your credit card balance each month, we ask that you use another method to contribute. We do not want you to give if it means that you will go into debt. If you'd like to talk with someone about managing your finances you can contact Brian Collings with the Dollars and Sense team.<br>		</body></html>
