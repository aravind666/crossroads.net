<p class="noPspace"><strong>Are my donations tax-deductible?</strong><br />Generally. Crossroads is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and all donations that we receive are tax-deductible. However, you should consult your tax advisor to see if you can deduct your donations. You will receive a receipt of your gift either by e-mail or by postal mail.<br /><br /><strong>What are your basic beliefs about money?</strong><br />We believe that God has blessed our church because, from the beginning, we have followed three core principles in the handling of money: (1) bless people, (2) base your budget on what God wants to happen, not based on what you might get and (3) money is a tool for a church to use, and therefore should be spent and not saved. We believe these things strike at the heart of how God wants money to be used as seen in the Bible.<br /><br /><strong>Where does Crossroads get all its money?</strong><br />It&rsquo;s the financial generosity of everyday people in our community that fuels the incredible life change that we experience around here. Our support comes from the tithes of average people (giving 10 percent of their earnings), as well as other contributions from Crossroads attendees.<br /><br /><strong>Does Crossroads have high accounting standards?</strong><br />Yes. We have an annual external audit by an independent CPA firm. You can request a copy of their report for any year and you will find that money given to Crossroads is managed with integrity.<br /><br /><strong>How does your budgeting process work?</strong><br />Each ministry, which consists of paid staff and volunteers, considers what their ministry goals and objectives are for the year. Corresponding costs are then determined. The appropriate staff contacts review and approve, and may recommend changes based on the overall vision for the church. The final step is approval by the Board of Spiritual Directors.<br /><br /><strong>Do you have an open book policy?</strong><br />Yes. It is easy for us to provide financial data since each ministry department receives a monthly recap of their expenditures versus their budget. Simply contact our office and we will provide the appropriate information.<br /><br /><strong>Does this mean I can find out individual staff salaries?</strong><br />No. We find that the release of this kind of personal financial information can lead to comparison and discontentment amongst staff members and in the congregation at large. It fosters an environment of value assessments on whether or not a staff member should get what they are being paid, without being privy to the most recent performance review and other factors that contribute to setting a salary. We believe in trusting those in leadership who are making financial decisions, specifically our Board of Spiritual Directors.<br /><br /><strong>Who sets salaries?</strong><br />The overall salary structure (and specifically the salary of the Sr. Pastor) is set by the Board of Spiritual Directors. This is a process that was unanimously approved by the Crossroads Owners (governing members). The Board of Spiritual Directors is comprised of Crossroads Owners (governing members) who are elected by other Owners.<br /><br /><strong>What principles are used in setting salaries?</strong><br />We use several criteria, including surveys of similar churches across the country to see what a similar position pays, the standard of living in Cincinnati, the individual&rsquo;s performance against stated goals and objectives and overall faithfulness and fruitfulness of the staff member.<br /><br /><strong>Why does Crossroads give things away?</strong><br />Crossroads is not a capital endeavor. We are a church that wants to build into people. If our people need something like a Bible, CDs of messages, coffee, curriculum, etc. we want them to have it.<br /><br /><strong>What happens with yearly left-over money?</strong><br />There is currently a fund to bankroll the Sr. Pastor&rsquo;s assistant&rsquo;s private Caribbean island for her retirement. Once that is paid for, all extra monies will be set aside for a private jet to ferry her to and from. Just kidding. The leftover money is put back into the ministry budget fund for the following year.<br /><br /><strong>Why do I have to re-enter my credit card information each time?</strong><br />When you chose a One Time Gift, we treat it as such and don&rsquo;t keep any financial information beyond the One Time Gift. We do offer a Recurring Gift option that allows you to contribute regularly once or twice a month &ndash; by credit card or direct withdrawal from a bank account. See e-gift below for more information.</p>

<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY and SECURITY</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><br /><strong>Is giving on the site safe? Is your site secure?</strong><br />Absolutely. Our site uses industry-standard SSL technology to ensure that the information you enter is kept secure from prying eyes. In addition, all sensitive information that we keep in our database is stored in encrypted form so that it is not human-readable.<br /><br /><strong>Will I get spam by giving you my information?</strong><br />While we may occasionally use your information to contact you, Crossroads does not buy, sell, barter, trade or otherwise distribute your information to any organization other than for the purposes you&rsquo;ve given us permission to do (i.e. we have to tell the credit card company your name in order to charge your credit card).<br /><br /><strong>I received a message saying that your site&rsquo;s certificate wasn&rsquo;t recognized. What should I do?</strong><br />Your computer&rsquo;s list of Certificate Authorities isn&rsquo;t current. You should update your computer&rsquo;s operating system software to get a current list. In the meantime, it is safe to use the site - the message is just a warning to make you aware of the situation.</p>

<h3>E-GIFT</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><br /><strong>What&rsquo;s an e-gift?</strong><br />E-gift is a completely voluntary, pre-approved way to electronically make contributions to Crossroads directly from your bank account or credit card, avoiding the hassle of putting cash or check in the offering bag each week.<br /><br /><strong>Does this really honor God?</strong><br />Many people feel that if giving is not done in the midst of a worship service, then it is somehow insignificant. The primary principle in giving is to be cheerful. In 2 Corinthians 9:7 it says, "Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." The joy of giving comes from the faithfulness of people offering back to God some of the resources he has blessed them with. The method of giving is an individual choice. The ease and consistency of using e-gift may help you meet your giving goals.<br /><br /><strong>Is there a minimum amount I need to contribute?</strong><br />No. You can designate any amount to be given via e-gift.<br /><br /><strong>Do I have to have an account with a particular bank?</strong><br />No. E-gift will work with any bank account located in the United States. E-gift also works with major credit cards, money market accounts and mutual funds at brokerage houses.<br /><br /><strong>What if I change my mind?</strong><br />You can cancel your participation at any time by contacting Crossroads or through the modify eGift page. You can also change the amount of your contribution at any time. Just keep in mind that it may take as many as seven to ten business days to implement your change.<br /><br /><strong>What if I want to give more to Crossroads on special occasions?</strong><br />You are always free to make gifts to Crossroads in excess of your monthly contributions. Some people do this as part of their year-end tax planning. Your contribution can be placed in the offering bag, mailed to the church office or given through the one time gift page.<br /><br /><strong>What&rsquo;s in it for Crossroads?</strong><br />Our primary motivation is to make it easier to support Crossroads financially. The automatic withdrawal avoids the hassle of having to make cash contributions or write individual checks to Crossroads each week. There are also some benefits to Crossroads in the form of administrative savings &ndash; not having to collect, count, record and deposit as many contributions from the offering bag, and having a more predictable cash flow to help in budgetary planning. While one result may be that some people give more regularly, this program is all about serving those who support this ministry.</p>

<h3>STOCK TRANSFERS</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><br /><strong>I don&rsquo;t use a broker. I have my own stock certificates. Can I still donate stock to Crossroads?</strong><br />There are special forms and procedures involved for transferring paper stock certificates. Please contact the finance department at finance@crossroads.net to start this process or to get more information.<br /><br /><strong>I have a mutual fund. How can I give shares from that?</strong><br />There are special forms and procedures unique to each mutual fund company. Please contact finance to discuss the specific procedures for your shares.<br /><br /><strong>I need to better understand how a stock gift affects my taxes.</strong><br />Crossroads does not provide legal or financial advice. For the details about a specific gift in the context of your unique financial situation, contact your attorney, accountant or financial planner. In general, gifts of appreciated securities held long term are one of the best ways to maximize the value of a gift and minimize the after-tax cost. Donors of appreciated stock receive a tax deduction for the full, fair-market value of the stock on the date of gift and pay no capital gain tax on the appreciation. A charitable contribution deduction of up to 30% of adjusted gross income is available, with carryover for up to five years for any unused deduction.<br /><br /><strong>I have a loss on some stock and want to sell it. Does it make sense to give it to Crossroads instead?</strong><br />Crossroads does not provide legal or financial advice. For the details about a specific gift in the context of your unique financial situation, contact your attorney, accountant or financial planner.<br /><br /><strong>What does Crossroads do with the stock?</strong><br />Crossroads instructs its broker to immediately sell the shares and transfer the proceeds to Crossroads.</p>

<h3>YOUR PERSONAL FINANCES</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><br />We do not provide investment advice or recommendations. We have a Dollars &amp; Sense team that is comprised of Crossroads volunteers who do not profit in any way from the program. No investment advice is given and no investment products are sold.<br /><br /><strong>What is Dollars and Sense?</strong><br />Crossroads&rsquo; Dollars and Sense financial ministry is designed to help people take control of their individual finances through periodic seminars and counseling.<br /><strong><br />Why Dollars and Sense?</strong><br />Money influences our relationships: how we live, how we work, how we dress, who we marry, what we drive, where we live&hellip;need we say more? Our goal is to equip you to develop a basic budget, control debt and manage your finances in a way that is pleasing to God.</p>
