<p class="noPspace">Like you heard in the video, we&rsquo;re looking for folks to declare themselves as hosts for the fall journey. We especially need hosts who will open their groups to new people. For now, we just need you to identify yourself as a host (see below), so we know who we&rsquo;re counting on for the fall.&nbsp;The Journey begins the weekend of October 6. The only requirement to be a host is to open your home for for six weeks (approximately two hours a week.) We&rsquo;re also asking you to consider posting your group on the Find a Small Group Tool. Whether you can take in two new people or ten, every post allows those who aren&rsquo;t currently connected to find a group.&nbsp;Check your calendar and let us know if we can count on you. Complete the form below to&nbsp;declare yourself as a host now.</p>
