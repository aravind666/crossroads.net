<h2>Small Groups</h2><img src="/images/uploadedImages/small-groups.gif" alt="Hi!" title="Hi!" width="150" height="80" align="right" /><span class="first">The weekend service can be inspiring, but it can't entirely fill the need we have for community.</span><br /><br />That&rsquo;s why we pare down into small groups of six, ten or so: gatherings where you can get comfortable, share, invest, change. We believe that big impact results from the life change that happens in small community. <strong>Because we're not made to do life alone.</strong> So God uses intimate connections with other people as catalysts for change&mdash;in us, in our relationships with him and others, in our families and in the world. Big stuff. Ready for something big? Start by getting small. <br /><br /><a href="/register.php">Register</a>, and you'll see more about how Small Groups happen. <a href="/about/why.htm">Why register?
