<p class="noPspace">Help park cars, hold doors, make coffee and more during the Atrium experience of Awaited. Doors open to the Atrium one hour before the show, so you may need to arrive as early as two hours before the show. This varies with each role, so we&rsquo;ll instruct you when you sign up.&nbsp;If you want to sign up multiple people, have everyone in your group sign up for the same show and role individually. We will do our best to accommodate you.</p>
