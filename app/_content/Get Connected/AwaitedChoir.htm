<p class="noPspace">Choir auditions are being held for anyone interested in being in Awaited (new folks, as well as returning choir members) on Tuesday, October 16&nbsp;and Wednesday, October 17&nbsp;from 6-9pm. Please read over all the requirements and prayerfully consider your involvement before signing up to audition.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">All choir members must attend <strong>EVERY</strong> rehearsal and perform in <strong>EVERY</strong> show. This year there are 15 shows, but we are taking off a day/night in the middle of the run, and we have less double show days. We realize this is a big commitment, but we&rsquo;re excited to have consistency and clarity around roles and responsibilities.</p>
