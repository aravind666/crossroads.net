<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<h2 class="subheading">We wanted a place to bring our friends, minus the church lingo, bad coffee and kum-ba-yah.</h2>

<p class="noPspace">So the eleven friends who started Crossroads in 1995 turned into thousands of people seeking truth and authentic community. And you&#8217;re invited to join in. We don&#8217;t expect you to agree with everything we do or say. We just ask that you&#8217;re open to considering the possibility that there is a God who loves and pursues you.</p>
