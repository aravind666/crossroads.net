<p class="header noPspace sectionHeader normal">Written by Brian Tome, Senior Pastor at Crossroads.&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Note: This letter is in response to a number of inquires that I&#8217;ve received over the past few days. It&#8217;s not intended to initiate a debate. It&#8217;s simply a way for me to provide pastoral insight to those in our community who are seeking it. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">I&#8217;ve had three kids make it through kindergarten unscathed. It never would have crossed my mind that coloring in art class could be interrupted by bullets flying through corridors. I never would have thought that I&#8217;d have a friend whose niece was murdered inside a Newtown kindergarten class. When I heard that news, I felt like I could vomit. I feel the swelling of fresh emotion every time a new story comes in from Connecticut.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#8220;Bothered&#8221; is too mild a word to describe my emotions. I&#8217;m angered by the senseless violence. My heart&#8217;s broken for parents who can&#8217;t give their child a new toy on Christmas and pissed that the perpetrator killed himself before someone could figure out a more tortuous ending to his life. That&#8217;s probably not a Godly thing to admit, but it&#8217;s how I feel.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">At the same time, I&#8217;m not surprised by this tragedy at all--at least not on the macro scale of overarching questions regarding the character of God and the characteristics of our world. There are no easy answers to scenarios like this. Ever. The reason that I&#8217;m not surprised is that the Bible is brutally clear as to why these things happen.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Death, tragedy, evil, and every kind of pain are illustrated through personal examples throughout the Bible. God, Himself, is no stranger to loss. He lost His only son to murder on a cross.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">When a man named Job from the Bible was in the midst of losing his health, wealth and every family member, his friends came and ministered to him. They were at their best when they simply sat with him in his mud puddle of grief. They were at their worst when they later tried to offer him trite spiritual answers.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">It is my heart to sit in the mud puddle with all who are hurting without giving insensitive spiritual answers at the wrong time. That being said, I&#8217;ve heard from some that I&#8217;m too silent right now. I humbly offer these words to bring clarity and maybe some level of comfort during this troubled time.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The Biblical reasons for pain and suffering don&#8217;t help when you are in the depths of emotional despair. Nor will they convince cynics who always use every tragedy to point a finger at God and chip away at the faith of others. But if you are a few states removed from the Newtown tragedy, and not trying to win an argument, perhaps this will be helpful.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>1) &#160;Sinful things naturally happen.</strong> Sin entered the world when Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate from the tree they were told to avoid. This rebellion caused all hell to break loose. Childbearing became painful. Work became fruitless. Life became limited. This broken world--ours--produces stagnant economies, destructive storms, birth defects and mass murderers. I don&#8217;t like any of these things but I&#8217;m never surprised by their presence, because God&#8217;s Word definitively spells out reality.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>2) There are spiritual entities who are intentionally working evil.</strong> Jesus said, in referring to Satan and his demonic forces, &#8220;The thief comes to steal, kill and destroy.&#8221; Jesus regularly ran into people who were possessed by evil spirits. Someone who has a personality disorder might have those characteristics because of natural causes, like poorly formed neural connections. Or that person could be influenced by an evil spirit. Whichever was the case with Adam Lanza, the enemy still stole life from parents, killed children, and is seeking to destroy our faith in our God.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>3) God never authors evil.</strong> President Obama said in a recent speech at Newtown: &#8220;God has called them all home.&#8221; I applaud his heart in offering words of comfort. However, I believe the more accurate thing to say is, &#8220;God has welcomed them all home.&#8221; Every time Jesus came in contact with an evil spirit or someone who was physically disabled, He never hinted that it was God who did this to the person. He always went on the offensive--aggressively eliminating evil that is outside the will of God.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>4) God will ultimately redeem every evil act.</strong> When Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers, they later came to him for help not knowing that it was their brother who had risen to be the COO in Pharaoh&#8217;s household and who had developed a financial plan to help the entire Middle East. When they finally figured out that their brother was the second most powerful person in the known world, Joseph said, &#8220;What you meant for evil, God used for good.&#8221; Romans 8:28 says, &#8220;And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The course of history and the narrative of scripture couldn&#8217;t be any clearer in letting us know that another awful thing is right around the corner. I don&#8217;t fear these things because that would be wasted spiritual energy. Jesus said, &#8220;Do not worry about tomorrow because today had enough worries in itself&#8221; (Matthew 6:34). When tragedy does strike, I do an internal spiritual audit that often leads to corrections. Here is what that audit looks like:</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong> 1) Am I in love with God or in love with a comfortable life?</strong> Being in love with a comfortable life will always let me down. This love of comfort is merely a false god vying for my affection. Instead, I choose to say to God, &#8220;Whatever you do in this world or with me, it is OK. I&#8217;ve signed up to serve you regardless of the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>2) Is there anything God is trying to teach me?</strong> Maybe I learn through an act of evil that I&#8217;ve become too dependent on my insurance policies. Maybe I learn that my electronic gizmos are numbing my soul and keeping me from being truly engaged with this world. Maybe I learn that I am not thinking critically enough about issues like gun control (I own two shotguns). Maybe I learn there is something I could do to avoid a similar situation happening to me. Jesus said, &#8220;God is always at work,&#8221; which means that even in the midst of difficulty, he is working on us.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>3) If death comes prematurely, am I ready?</strong> Am I right with God? Am I right relationally with others to the degree I can influence? Am I participating in sins that I&#8217;m not looking forward to interacting with God about? Am I actively blessing the world to the degree that God will say, &#8220;Well done good and faithful servant&#8221;?</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>4) Am I ready for death to come prematurely to someone else?</strong> Tragedy reminds us that life is frail and it isn&#8217;t worth nurturing grudges or leaving words of love unsaid. I recommit myself to having conversation and parting company with more relational tension than necessary. To do that, I&#8217;m happy to lose.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Everyone has doubts. Every follower of Jesus and atheist alike will have doubts when tragedy strikes close to home. Don&#8217;t allow your doubts to needlessly beat you up. In fact, if your doubts cause you to beat up on God, that&#8217;s OK--He can take it. I&#8217;ve done that on many occasion and later looped back in with Him to apologize and restore the relationship.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Pain and suffering is not a modern phenomena. It has existed in all time periods and in all cultures. Yet, other cultures haven&#8217;t questioned the existence of God in the midst of pain as much as ours does. This is because our culture mostly follows the god of the American Dream. This false god has arguably created the softest people group in the history of humanity. We have more conveniences, comforts, insurance policies, possessions and avocations that anyone I&#8217;ve known or read about. When we don&#8217;t get something we think we deserve or when we lose something we believe we have earned, we think God has let us down. Yes, the god of the American Dream who tells you all will be fine if you are responsible and diligent has let you down. That god will always let you down because he is a false god set up by the Evil One who wants to steal, kill and destroy your hope in the One True God.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We are at our best spiritually when we are bothered but not surprised.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Father, I know you could have stopped that psycho but you chose not to. I have no idea how many brutal acts you have stopped in the last 48 hours that we will never know about, but I wish it were one more. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I pray for you to bring grace to every family and friend affected by the Satanic killing of innocent children and administrators. You worked your good through the enslavement of Joseph and the death of Jesus. I pray that you do it again. Parents simply aren&#8217;t supposed to outlive their children. That wound is likely to never fully heal. However, I pray you surprise the victims with your healing power and your grace. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Your Word says, &#8220;There is no grieving nor sorrow&#8221; in heaven. We grieve our loss while the departed children are jumping and playing with you. I don&#8217;t pray for the departed children who are now fully cared for by you, but I am praying for your other children of adult age in Newtown, CT. Bring them into a relationship with you. Help them to grieve healthily and to lean on you in ways they couldn&#8217;t have previously known. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>I also pray for all my brothers and sisters at Crossroads. Help us to experience your comfort and your peace that passes all understanding. Help us to turn away from our false gods and embrace the only God who has created us and suffered for us. I commit myself to honor you while loving and leading this great group of people the best I can. </em></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><em>Though I may be in the minority, I say you are good. I say you are in control. I say you are doing things right now that I can&#8217;t understand. You are the redeemer. Please do it again. I&#8217;m bothered but not surprised.</em></p>
