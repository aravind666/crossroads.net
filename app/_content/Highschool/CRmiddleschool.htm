<p class="noPspace"><span class="subheading">Coming in August</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="subheading"><br /></span>Beginning in August, kids in grades 6-8 can be a part of Crossroads&rsquo; new Middle School Ministry. Middle School, which will meet at all sites, will follow a regular flow each week&mdash;hang out time, music, a message about who God is and how middle schoolers fit into God&rsquo;s story, and a chance for them to talk about what they&rsquo;re learning in small groups led by adult volunteers.<br /><br /><span class="sectionHeader">FAQ:<br /></span><strong>My child was getting ready to go into sixth grade, which was Area 56. What does that mean for her?</strong> <br />Your sixth grader will go to Middle School Ministry starting with move-up weekend in August.<br /><br /><strong>Is Middle School Ministry the same as CSM?<br /></strong>It&rsquo;s a new program with new vision and leadership. The format will be similar to Area 56, in that there is a specific rhythm to every week, but the programming is adjusted to keep middle schoolers engaged. Middle School Ministry is like CSM, in that there will be adult volunteers who will build into your kids each week.<br /><br /><strong>Is CSM going away?<br /></strong>The last weekend for CSM is May 26-27, but Crossroads remains committed to meeting the needs of middle and high school students, so we&rsquo;ll introduce new programming in late summer for both age groups.<br /><br /><strong>Will my sixth graders be hanging out with high schoolers?<br /></strong>No; the Middle School Ministry will meet separately from the High School Ministry.<br /><br /><strong>At which services will the new Middle School Ministry be offered?<br /></strong>It will meet at most services. Look for more details about Middle School Ministry later this summer.</p>
