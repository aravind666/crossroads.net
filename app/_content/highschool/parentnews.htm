<h2 class="subheading">Hey, parents. Here&#8217;s the latest.</h2>

<div class="sectionHeader" style="font-weight: bold;">A Place at the Table</div>
</strong>
<div class="normal">We&#8217;ve been seeing some amazing responses from the students in the midst of the &#8220;A Place at the Table&#8221; series. While diving deep into what it means to believe that they are God&#8217;s treasured children instead of living as abandoned orphans, the teens have gotten really honest about how they feel and see themselves. Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity to continue to train them at home in this area. Talk with their pod leaders about what they&#8217;re noticing. And as your own beliefs shift around your identity, don&#8217;t hesitate to share your experience with your teens as you walk through it. Just imagine if your whole family started to live daily as treasured children, and you worked as a team to ensure that the orphan spirit finds no room in your household.

<div class="sectionHeader" style="font-weight: bold;">Next CSM Series</div>
<div class="normal">This series has been so good, that we have decided to build on the momentum with four weeks centered on families. It will be entitled &#8220;Team&#8221;, and we&#8217;ll are focused on helping shift their hearts towards you (their parents), instead of just agreeing with the cultural message of rebellion and independence. We will be communicating with you via email throughout this series so you will be prepared to lead them each week. It&#8217;s going to be really good. So as we develop the details, we&#8217;ll keep you in the loop!No CSM for Two WeeksEaster weekend is April 7-8, and we will be closing the CSM doors so teens can join their families for the holiday services. CSM will also be closed the following weekend, April 14-15, to allow for a big Crossroads prayer experience. So CSM will be back and meeting as normal on April 21-22 weekend after a two-week break.

<div class="sectionHeader" style="font-weight: bold;">Summer Trips</div>
<div class="normal">We have been working a little longer than usual to make decisions on summer trips for 2012, so thanks for being patient with us as you look at your family&#8217;s calendar. We have decided to do just one trip this summer. We&#8217;ll be headed to Ichthus Music Festival over June 20-24. All current 7-12 graders are invited, and we handed out trip packets this past weekend in CSM. If the packet didn&#8217;t make it home, you can always download it from <a href="/csm">www.crossroads.net/csm</a> under the &#8220;Summer Trips&#8221; heading. Ichthus has become a CSM tradition over the years, and we look forward to taking a big group this summer. Please let us know if you need financial assistance. We&#8217;re happy to help out!
