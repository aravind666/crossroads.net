<h2 class="subheading"><span class="header">ReachOut</span><br />Engaging in our world</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="normal">God says, "Serve the poor." Love them, learn from them, fight for their freedom.
<br />So we mobilize hundreds of people&mdash;sometimes thousands&mdash;to build relationships and meet needs. And God shows up.

<p class="noPspace">Sometimes it&rsquo;s a one-day citywide blitz, sometimes it&rsquo;s investing time with the same child or prison inmate from week to week.
We take God&rsquo;s command to serve the poor seriously, and we seek to learn from those who have less.<br /><br /></p>

Whether it&rsquo;s South Africa or Asia, we leave our own neighborhoods to be in others. We don&rsquo;t go as fixers; we go as servant-learners.
And that&rsquo;s how homes get built, victims comforted, children rescued and lives literally changed.</div>
