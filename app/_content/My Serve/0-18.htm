<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">It&rsquo;s never a dull moment. Never an un-impacting day. </span><br /><br />We think kids are just to die for, and we want them to have a super fun, super adventure when they&rsquo;re around this place. And we need people who can inspire a teenager, walk a toddler, and help a 5th grader figure out their faith and how to relate to their peers. There&rsquo;s a ton of roles&mdash;even things that are entirely behind the scenes&mdash;so think about what you could do (or let us think with you). The reward is great. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>Note For Current Kids&rsquo; Club Volunteers:<a title="Link to serve site" href="http://www.crossroadscommunity.net/servenet/login.aspx"> Looking For The Serve Site?</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">Kids&rsquo; Club volunteers looking for the Serve Site should click <a title="Link to the Serve Site" href="http://www.crossroadscommunity.net/servenet/login.aspx">here</a>. We&rsquo;re finalizing these elements of crossroads.net and will let you know when we migrate off of the Serve Site to use crossroads.net for scheduling. If you don&rsquo;t know what the Serve Site is, don&rsquo;t worry, your ministry leader can fill you in on the details. Please note that you&rsquo;ll need to use the Serve Site username and password that you&rsquo;ve already been given. You will not be able to use your crossroads.net username and password. <em>Remember: if you&rsquo;re signed up to serve and find out that you can&rsquo;t make it, please call 513.731.7400 x363 to let us know.</em><br /><br /></p>
<h3><a href="/my/Serve/018/KidsClub.htm">Kids&rsquo; Club</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">From the size of the toilets to the bright colors and nutty dances, everything in Kids&rsquo; Club is created just for kids. We want kids to know God loves them and he offers a fun, adventurous life. While experiences vary by age, volunteers and staff in Kids&rsquo; Club are committed to showing kids a great time with lots of love while they explore God. Want to be a part of it? Sing, storytell, clean toys, paint murals, greet at the doors, run videos. <br /><br /></p>
<h3><a href="/my/Serve/018/ImAKid.htm">I&rsquo;m a Kid</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">We love kids around here. We need you, just as much as we need the oldies. If you&rsquo;re at least 10, you can work with two-year-olds through pre-kindergarten. Help them build cool things, hug them when they&rsquo;re crying, smile at their parents. Just make sure you&rsquo;re also going to your Kids&rsquo; Club class or the main auditorium services.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><a href="/my/serve/018/csmjrsenior.htm" target="_blank">High School</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">If you&rsquo;re an adult who thinks teens are hilarious and cool, you could be a serious influence on our youth. We have a ton of roles, so even if you don&rsquo;t want to mentor or teach, you can set up the game room, help create video or plan bus rides for an inner city service project. We promise it&rsquo;ll be a little wild, a little challenging and a lot of wonderful.</p>
