<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><strong class="first">Help people experience God, often for the first time. </strong><br><br>Not everything happens under spotlight. Think Emerald City and a bunch of tiny wizards. Wizards who count beans, unlock computers and stuff communion bags so that every person who sits down in the auditorium can decide if they&#8217;re ready to experience God and then get to. Think about <em>that </em>wizard.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><span class="sectionHeader">Weekday Behind the Scenes<br></span></p>
<p class="noPspace">There are ongoing teams needed throughout the year. This may support some of the prep week leading up to a weekend service, stuffing, printing, collating, etc. Jack of all trades are welcome here and the work is important. These projects typically take place Monday &#8211; Friday (9am&#8211;4pm) at all three sites. <a href="" target="_blank">SIGN UP. </a></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Though small in number, these volunteers deal with the big green. Some meet monthly to literally count bills; others, with financial expertise, consult people on budgeting, getting out of debt and how we can follow God&#8217;s plan while managing our money. (OK, and it probably goes without saying that we need to see your track record first. If it includes strange bouts of gambling&#8230;well.) <a href="">SIGN UP</a>.<br><br></p>
<h3>Information Technology</h3>
<p class="noPspace">We have teams focused on web development, quality assurance, and a weekend support and projects team that does a little bit of everything. You get to impact tons of ministries and individuals, plus you get to help shape the future of Crossroads. It&#8217;s flex hours and flex commitment, so give it a trial run and see what&#8217;s there for you. <a title="Sign Up To Serve In IT" href="">SIGN UP.</a><br><br></p>
