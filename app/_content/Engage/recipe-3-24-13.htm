<p>White beans such as Great Northern Beans and Basmati or Jasmine rice (preferably long grain rice). Please note that the ingredients and quantities are guidelines. Cooking is not an exact science. If you don’t have an ingredient or two or don’t like one, feel free to change it up. </p>
<p>My suggestion is to keep as close to the original recipe the first time its prepared and modify the quantities and/or ingredients thereafter.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions/Bean prep:</strong></p>
<p>Soak the beans overnight with three times the volume of cold water and a spoon of baking soda. Keep the soaking beans in the refrigerator. Drain the beans the following day and rinse the beans with cold water. In a pot or sauté pan, using a little vegetable oil (e.g. canola) sauté the bacon until golden. Pull the bacon out and reserve. In the same pan using the bacon fat, add the onions, garlic and leeks and sauté to light golden. Add the beans, chicken stock and thyme and cook over medium heat until the beans are tender. Do not add salt until the beans are tender. Add chicken broth if necessary. Add the vegetables and cook until just tender. Add salt and pepper to taste. Before serving you may want to add some butter or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).</p>

<p>
  <strong>The Rice:</strong>
  
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Rice will increase by volume about 2 ½ - 3 times.</li>
    <li>Place a pot with salted water and bring to a roaring boil.</li>
    <li>Add the rice and decrease the heat the medium-high.</li>
    <li>Cook stirring from time to time until rice is just tender. About 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>When rice is just cooked, strain using a sieve or colander.</li>
    <li>Return the rice into the pot and add some soft butter or extra virgin olive oil.</li>
    <li>Correct seasoning and add some fresh chopped herbs (e.g. parsley and/or chive).</li>
    <li>Scoop a mound of rice onto a plate, creating a cavity in the center that would resemble the mouth of a volcano.</li>
    <li>Scoop some beans in the center and sprinkle with some fresh herbs, if desired.</li>
  </ul>
