I’ll be highlighting my key takeaways from <em>Fields of Gold</em> on a weekly basis, and look forward to celebrating God’s work with all of you in the coming months. </p>

<div>The first part of "Fields of Gold" mainly bummed me out. I was reminded of a recording I tried to make on my DVR that failed. It was Ken Burn’s latest documentary on "The Dust Bowl." I’ve always been curious about that time in America’s history and Andy’s reference to it relation to giving piqued by interest even more.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>He said, "You and I live in a dust bowl." When he wrote those words the greatest financial meltdown of our lifetimes had yet to even occur. His assessment is probably true of just about all people in all time periods and in all locations. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I notice that my money must be planted in the lives of others just as seed that doesn’t go into dirt won’t produce a return. A never ending mind bender for me is how much in this present season? God cares about giving AND saving AND His children having their needs met AND some wants as well. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I’m hoping that this book gives me a bit of guidance and perspetive for this unique season of my life. </div>
