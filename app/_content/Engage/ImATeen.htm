<p class="noPspace">We don't want a place run by grownups. Crossroads is all about YOU participating. We use your ideas, your music, your words, your talent, and your ability to love others <strong>in a way that only teens can</strong>. So there's a lot you can do. Come to CSM Jr. and Sr. and get to know us. Join in on a mission experience. Or start your own thing.<br /><br /></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="sectionHeader">Also, we&rsquo;d love you to serve in Kids&rsquo; Club. </span></p>
<p class="noPspace">One thing younger kids love is teens who hang out with them. We know little brothers and sisters can be a drag, but what if they're not yours? What if you could build a 4-year old the coolest tent he's ever been in? What if you could push the Fussy Baby Bus and make them laugh instead of cry? You can do this stuff.&nbsp; Jr. Highers can work with 1 year olds &ndash; 2nd grade; Sr. Highers can work with 1 year olds &ndash; Area 56.<br /><br /><a title="SIGN UP FOR OAKLEY" href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=KidsClub">SIGN UP FOR OAKLEY</a><br /><a title="SIGN UP FOR MASON" href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=MasonKC">SIGN UP FOR MASON</a></p>
