<h2>Community Groups</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Help others connect and grow. </span><br /><br />Community Groups are one way we make a big church small. They're a time of growth, healing and connection for people who want to study a certain topic, or be around people who have experienced what they have. So we need people who feel led to teach and facilitate groups. Sometimes it may feel like a step out in faith, but God blesses our sincerity and generosity. Your story can help others grow and heal. <br /> <br /></p>
<h3>Current Groups</h3>

<h3>Serving Roles</h3>
<p class="noPspace">We have specific roles for volunteers. Some roles&mdash;like coordinators, teachers and facilitators&mdash;need people in them who are spiritually mature and understand Crossroads' culture. Some need people who have experienced the topic the group is studying, and want to share their growth and healing. Other roles just require warm smiles or people who like to push buttons. <a title="Email Jenny Baker" href="http://www.crossroads.net/mysend/139">Email us</a> if you're interested. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>Start a New Group</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Is there a group you feel inspired to start, on a topic we&rsquo;re not yet covering? <a title="Email Jenny Baker" href="http://www.crossroads.net/mysend/139">Tell us about it</a> and we&rsquo;ll pray about it and think through it with you.    <br /><br /></p>
