<p class="header noPspace">We Run.</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">(literally)</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We run after a lot of things around here like eradicating poverty, connecting people to God’s transformational love and freeing girls from sex slavery. And to do all that, we have to be able to physically keep up. So we’re going to literally run and see what happens.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>WE ARE STARTING A RUNNING GROUP</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lace up those shoes and join us for our early morning Saturday running group. This will happen once a week leading up to the <a href="http://www.flyingpigmarathon.com/" target="_blank">Flying Pig</a> and you can expect more details based on the information collected below. Getting these runs out of the way before the day begins is critical and we’ll be sure to provide you with ongoing guidance that will help you train the rest of the week.  </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>WHO CAN ATTEND THIS GROUP?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Bring your spouse and/or kids (strollers encouraged), as well as friends, neighbors, co-workers,  and whoever else you can rope into this adventure. Oh yeah, did we mention it’s all free?</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>HOW CAN I JOIN?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">To get more info.,<strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/crossroads.net/forms/d/1Sn_GtqV9UAgmoXTJUfOMp_uGsnlcAbBzwiHr7lcAjfk/viewform"> click here</a></strong> and you’ll hear back from us in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>WHY RUNNING MATTERS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The Flying Pig Marathon has become a city-wide tradition. Runners and volunteers from all over engage in a journey towards personal health. And since we love this city (which we really really do), we wonder what it might look like to love our health AND our city at the same time.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We are in the midst of a series titled: <a href="/media/series" target="_blank"><strong>Power to Change</strong></a> and we are challenging folks to get involved. Whether that’s running your first 5K (which is 3.1 miles for those of us who don’t live in Europe) or attempting the Half-Marathon, we want to experience God through the pursuit of physical health and engage in something unique to our city.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We can’t do this alone and we aren’t claiming to be the experts. We simply need help, motivation and encouragement and that’s what we want to do. We are just ordinary people who want to take care of our bodies, run after God and do this in community. <strong>So get excited...this is going to be sweet!</strong></p>
