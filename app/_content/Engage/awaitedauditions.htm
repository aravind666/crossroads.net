<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr"><em>Awaited: A Christmas Show</em> is an original, contemporary retelling of the Christmas story and it&rsquo;s returning for a 8th season. The show is a Crossroads production of full-scale theatrical performances utilizing all local talent for everything from musical arrangements to dance to costume and set design.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr">The performance&nbsp;includes a ten-piece band, adult choir, children&rsquo;s choir, original dance performances and layered video projections. Audience members are immersed in the experience&mdash;from stars on the ceiling to snow falling to choir members and dancers moving throughout the auditorium. To make room for our friends, this year twenty-nine free, ticketed shows will take place at Crossroads Oakley starting on December 5th.</p>
