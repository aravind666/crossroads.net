<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr"><em>Awaited: A Christmas Show</em> is an original, contemporary retelling of the Christmas story and it’s returning for a 7th season. The show is a Crossroads production of full-scale theatrical performances utilizing all local (and largely volunteer) talent for everything from musical arrangements to dance to costume and set design.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr">The performance includes a ten-piece band, adult choir, children’s choir, original dance performances and layered video projections. Audience members are immersed in the experience—from stars on the ceiling to snow falling to choir members and dancers moving throughout the auditorium. Fifteen free, ticketed shows will take place at Crossroads Oakley starting on December 13.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr">Each year, we try to find hidden gems in our community who have the kind of talent and experience that can enrich <em>Awaited</em>. In the past, our cast has included touring musicians, recording artists, broadway dancers and card-carrying members of SAG. <strong style="line-height: 1;"><em>This year, Awaited</em> show producers will be holding auditions on July 9, 17 and 22 for actors, dancers, drummers and singers who have professional or semi-professional experience to join our cast. (Stage crew and kids roles will be filled at a later date.)</strong></p>
