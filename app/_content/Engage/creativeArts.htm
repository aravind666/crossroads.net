<h2>Creative Arts</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><strong><span class="first">Artists seem to congregate around here.</span></strong><br><br>And artists are a major blessing to this community. So if you love creative communication—whether that’s video, lighting, stage design, music or behind-the-scenes work—we’ll find a way to get you involved. People are often drawn to Crossroads because of the non-churchy aesthetics, and your creativity can help.</p>
<h3>Music Teams</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Musicians, vocalists, lyricists, ambience-creators: we’re always auditioning and finding new sound. Let us hear what you’ve got. Do you polka? Well then, bring the polka. <a title="Apply for Music Teams" href="/index.php?action=viewpage&amp;filepath=pages/music/musicTeam-overview.htm">SIGN UP </a></p>
<h3>Set Construction</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Help us build sets that thousands of people lay their eyes on. Usually this means some heavy lifting and a good old power-saw, but we also need painters, hammer swingers and screwdrivers (of the non-intoxicating variety). <a title="Sign Up for Set Construction Team" href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=CA-SetConstruction">SIGN UP </a></p>
<h3>Acting &amp; Dancing</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Whether you like to hang in the big spotlight or just want to dash across the screen, we need all sorts. We want our actors to be as diverse as the community that comes here every weekend, so don’t worry about your hair or your best angle. Just tell us your name and what you’d like to do. <a title="Sign Up for Acting &amp; Dancing Team" href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=CA-ActingDancing">SIGN UP </a></p>
<h3>Actors &amp; Extras</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Been waiting for your big break? Think it would be fun to see yourself on the big screen one weekend? We want our videos to be a reflection of our community, so that means YOU. No acting experience required, but it helps if you aren’t shy in front of a camera, have a flexible schedule or can take some time off work during the day because we shoot during the week. Please sign up here and then post a picture of yourself on your Crossroads’ web profile (very important) so we know who you are. If you don’t hear from us right away, don’t worry-once you’re on our list, you’re sure to get a random call for a strange video at some point...when you least expect it.   <a href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=CA-VideoActors">SIGN UP</a></p>
<h3>Video Volunteers</h3>
<p class="noPspace">If you would like to help with video, you can help us spread the big-screen love: push buttons, mix sound, edit a clip, hold a camera. Even if you’re untrained, we can find a role for you. Projects are sporadic, but we keep volunteer lists and use what we’ve got. (And we’re fingers-crossed that there is an animator and sound-mixer in Cincinnati who would just love to donate a little time.) <a href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=CA-Video">SIGN UP </a></p>
<h3>Video Professionals</h3>
<p class="noPspace">If you’re a production professional of any kind or a professional hobbyist with your own gear-what can we say? You are rare and wonderful and we’d love to know you! We need producers, cameramen, editors, sound-mixers, animators, prop and wardrobe stylists, make-up artists. If you want to make us very happy and volunteer, call and tell us you have some free time you’ve been wondering what to do with. We’re also specifically looking for volunteers in the Mason area to serve at our Mason location. <a href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=CA-VideoPros">SIGN UP</a></p>
<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
<p class="noPspace">If you’re a trained, professional graphic designer, we’d love to get you involved somehow. Opportunities in this area are more sporadic than in many other serving areas, but please tell us how you’re interested in serving and we’ll add you to our list of go-to, rock-star designers we call on from time to time.    <a title="Sign Up for Graphic Design" href="/my/serve/signUp.php?form=CA-Communications">SIGN UP</a></p>
<h3>Sound and A/V Team</h3>
<p class="noPspace">Love cables, equalizers, buttons and beats? Amateurs or experts, we could use you. We need people on weekdays and weekends, in the main auditorium and youth areas. Fear not: we’ll train you, and you’ll have the chance to help others hear, see and experience God. <a title="Sign Up fo Sound A/V Team" href="/index.php?action=viewpage&amp;filepath=pages/forms/SoundAVTeamApplication.htm">SIGN UP</a></p>
