<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">We believe in changing this city. Join us? </span><br /><br /></p>
<h3>ONGOING PROJECTS:</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><br /><strong>The Diner</strong><br /> Help us serve meals to the hungry. We go restaurant-style at City Gospel Mission: delivering meals to the table and eating alongside those who come in. So come serve dinner on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th Fridays of each month, or breakfast on the 5th Saturdays. It&rsquo;s low-commitment, high-impact. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /><strong>The Outlet</strong><br /> Hang out at the City Gospel Mission game room on Saturday mornings, where we volunteer with OneCity. Drink coffee, shoot pool, play Spades. Engage with homeless folks who are looking for a positive, friendly place to be. Come once or keep coming. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /><strong>Habitat for Humanity</strong><br /> We believe decent, affordable housing for everyone is something God cares deeply about. Hang drywall, paint trim, hit a nail. Help build homes and relationships with low-income families on Saturdays. No prior construction experience needed (but if you&rsquo;ve got it, we&rsquo;ll take it). <a title="register" href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details<br /><br /><strong>Whiz Kids Tutoring &amp; Mentoring</strong><br /> Love on kids. If you still remember how to multiply or spell &ldquo;defanitely&rdquo; (yeah, it&rsquo;s not like that), try being a tutor for one school year. We partner with CityCURE and OneCity, and we have three kinds of roles:<br /><strong> Daytime Tutors:</strong> Go to the child&rsquo;s school and work with them, there. Grades K-8.<br /><strong> Monday Evening Tutors</strong>: Meet at Crossroads Oakley, study, create fun art. Grades 3-8. <br /><strong> Mentoring</strong>: Really build into at-risk kids. Get to know their families, introduce them to yours, go to a Reds game, bring them to Crossroads. Be a trusted friend. Grades 5-8.<a href="/register.php"> Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /><strong>StepUp Prison Mentoring</strong><br />Spend time with residents at the River City Correctional Facility (RCCF), who are trying to make life work again and have asked for help. It&rsquo;s a six-month commitment, while the resident lives at RCCF, and then transitions into life outside prison. We&rsquo;ve partnered with Jobs Plus and OneCity, and would love having you as a partner, too. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /><strong>TeamWorks Job Mentoring</strong> <br />Help people in nearby communities go from unemployed to self-sufficient. Stick around for a year (meet twice a month), so that you can encourage emotional and spiritual growth. We also need mock interviewers and job searchers. We&rsquo;ve partnered with OneCity and Cincinnati Works on this one. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /><strong>CityLink</strong><br />Because there&rsquo;s no current infrastructure able to handle the thousands of volunteer hours that Crossroads could generate, we&rsquo;ve joined with local churches and non-profits to build CityLink&mdash;a centralized campus where people can connect with each other and with the services they need to find holistic life change, and break the poverty cycle. While the CityLink Center is still in process, CityLink (the movement) is now. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /><strong>Wheels</strong><br />Help meet transportation needs in our community&mdash;so people can get out and find jobs, take their children to the doctor, go grocery shopping. Our job as the Wheels&rsquo; Team is to recondition donated cars and pass them on to qualified recipients. So whether you&rsquo;re a certified tech or just know a lot about engines and oil, we&rsquo;d love for you to join. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>ONCE-A-YEAR PROJECTS:</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>GO Cincinnati </strong><br />Every year in mid-May, you can join an army of 4000 volunteers from Crossroads and other churches throughout Cincinnati to transform neighborhoods, serve the homeless, pray with the broken, paint schools, clean-up camps and help make a difference in our city.<br /><br /><strong>Thanksgiving Food Drive</strong><br />Help a family in need by providing a Thanksgiving Food Box. Crossroads will deliver it to one of over 50 local churches and organizations who then give the meals out to bless their communities. Or, buy non-perishables and they&rsquo;ll be shipped to our partner church in South Africa. Thousands are fed, thousands feel love.<br /><br /><strong>Fall Feast</strong><br />We need 300 people to help out at City Gospel Mission, on T-day itself. You can stay at The Diner and serve meals, or deliver meals to the sick and elderly in nearby communities. <br /><br /><strong>Angel Tree </strong><br />At Christmas, bless a child with a parent in prison. On behalf of the parent, buy two gifts (one practical, one fun). The parents write their own gift tags, and then we deliver the gifts to kids and caregivers all over Cincinnati. <a href="/register.php">Register</a> and get the details.<br /><br /></p>
