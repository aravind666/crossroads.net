<h2>ReachOut: GO Mamelodi</h2>
<span class="first">We joined a new community, in South Africa. </span><br><br><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Check out the new <a href="/gomamelodi" title="GO Mamelodi">GO Mamelodi section</a> of this website for lots of details, and to sign up to GO.<br><br>Life in South Africa is hard. Vestiges of apartheid, widespread
unemployment, the AIDS epidemic and a gerneral lack of resources contribute to a cycle of generational poverty that can
seem impossible to break. But we're there to serve them, in any way we can. <strong><br><br></strong>In 2006, 300 people from Crossroads flew to South Africa and began building into the community there. In 2007, 600 people followed. And here's what happened:<br><ul>
<li>The combined generosity of people at Crossroads funded the construction of an AIDS hospice: a whole-spectrum AIDS care facility encompassing prevention education, testing, activites and support groups, anti-retroviral (ARV) dispensing and hospice care. </li>
<li>Hospice of Cincinnati came on board, and now we're working towards making the hospice a best-in-class operation and a model for other facilities in Africa.</li>
<li>We partnered with Charity and Faith Mission Church in Mamelodi, South Africa. We now have amazing friends who we get to serve, and who serve us. </li>
<li>When we GO Mamelodi, we plant vegetable gardens, build homes, teach kids and
transfer sustainable skills. We pray with the sick, love on the
hurting and make new friendships. We come back tired, joyful and
changed.</li>
</ul>
