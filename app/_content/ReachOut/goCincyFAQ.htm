<p class="noPspace"><strong>What if I want to serve on a project with my friends, small group, synchronized swimming team?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Great. We love groups. Just follow these 5 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to your friends and family and decide who will be in your group.</li>
<li>Decide what type of group project you&rsquo;d like to do. Pick a first, second and third choice of project type that works for everyone. We try to make projects kid-friendly but if you&rsquo;re not sure your kids would have fun and could help, you might want to make other arrangements for them that day.</li>
<li>Pick the name of one member of the group as your Group Connector (a name that everyone in your group will select when signing up to let us know that you want to serve together).</li>
<li>The person named as Group Connector signs up first, answers &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the question &ldquo;Are you serving with a group?&rdquo;, names themselves as Group Connector and picks the group&rsquo;s first, second and third choice of project type.</li>
<li>Everyone in the group then signs up, also answering &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the question &ldquo;Are you serving with a group?&rdquo; and then selects the Group Connector&rsquo;s name from a list of possible choices.</li>
</ol>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>What if I have a friend who is a Team Captain and is officially leading a project?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to &ldquo;are you serving with a group&rdquo; and select their name from the list of Group Connector names and you&rsquo;ll be placed on their team.Should each member of our family sign up separately? One sign up per family if you&rsquo;d all like to serve on the same project, please.</p>
