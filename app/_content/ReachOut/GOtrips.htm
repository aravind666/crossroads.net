<p class="header noPspace">GO Somewhere</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Whether it&rsquo;s South Africa, New Orleans or India, we leave our own neighborhoods to be in others.</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">We don&rsquo;t go as Ô¨Åxers; we go as servant-learners. And we believe in forming lasting, reciprocal relationships with the people we serve. That&rsquo;s how homes get built, victims comforted, patients cared for, children rescued and lives literally changed.</p>
