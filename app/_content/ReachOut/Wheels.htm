<p class="subheading noPspace">Provide a car or your time, and meet transportation needs in our community.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Have you ever thought about trying to find a job, get to work, buy groceries or take the kids to the doctor without a car? In this day and age, it&#8217;s difficult, almost impossible, to live in Cincinnati without a vehicle. Wheels is a volunteer team dedicated to helping meet the transportation needs of people in our community. The team reconditions donated vehicles and passes them on to qualified recipients. <br><br> <span class="sectionHeader"><strong>Donate</strong></span><br> Do you have a used car that&#8217;s in decent condition that you&#8217;re thinking or trading or selling? Consider giving it to the Wheels ministry instead. You can get a tax deduction for the fair market value. And more importantly, you&#8217;ll get the satisfaction of knowing that you&#8217;ve been a huge blessing to someone in need. <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/mysend/32">Email us</a>&#160;or call 513.731.7400 x1584. <br><br><strong><span class="sectionHeader">Volunteer</span><br><br>Service Team:</strong><br>Whether you&#8217;re an ASE Certified Technician, a backyard mechanic that loves to tinker, or someone that likes to make a car shine, there&#8217;s a place for you at Wheels.
