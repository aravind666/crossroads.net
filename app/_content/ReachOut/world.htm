<h3><a href="" target="_blank">GO South Africa</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">Hundreds of people fly to South Africa to plant gardens, build homes, teach kids and transfer sustainable skills. We pray with the sick, love on the hurting, and make new friends. Then we come back tired, joyful and changed. We&#8217;ll be taking a trip in the winter of 2013 with 100 people. Want to learn more? <a href="">Check out the GO South Africa portion of the site for more info.</a></p>
<h3><a title="GO New Orleans" href="">GO New Orleans</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">We are taking a second trip to help rebuild homes in New Orleans&#8217; Katrina-ravaged Upper Ninth Ward. We&#8217;ll be building homes in partnership with Habitat for Humanity and running a Vacation Bible School with our partner church (Franklin Avenue Baptist Church) and helping bring hope to a city that many have forgotten. There will be two trips this year, with 200 people on each one. <strong>July 10-18 and July 17-25</strong>.&#160; <a title="GO New Orleans" href="">Check out the GO New Orleans portion of the site for more info</a>.</p>
<h3><a title="Justice" href="">Justice</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">We&#8217;re in active relationship with leading non-governmental organizations committed to fighting to free slaves around the world. Through our relationship with International Justice Mission (IJM), we&#8217;re fighting against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Mumbai, India. We need prayers, entrepreneurs, artists, activists, lawyers, social workers and people passionate about praying for the work of justice. <br><br><strong>Please <a title="Register for crossroads.net" href="">register</a> to get the latest info on all of these opportunities as it becomes available.</strong></p>
