<h2>ReachOut: The Outlet</h2>
<p class="noPspace">Connect with the homeless in our city. Show them that people&#160;<em>do</em>&#160;care.&#160;Build relationships with the homeless in our city by hanging out at The Outlet at&#160;<a title="City Gospel Mission" href="">City Gospel Mission</a>, a place where they can recharge and connect with people who care about them by providing positive interpersonal relationships. Whether it&#8217;s playing cards, shooting pool or just sharing stories, friendships are built and hope is transferred at The Outlet. And through the relationships established there, the homeless are then encouraged to enter into long-term recovery programs.</p>
