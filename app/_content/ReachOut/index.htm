<p class="subheading noPspace">Be the church.</p>

<p class="noPspace">God tells us to serve those in need. To love them, learn from them, fight for their freedom. So we mobilize hundreds of people&#8212;sometimes thousands&#8212;and we respond to God&#8217;s call.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Sometimes it&#8217;s a one-day citywide blitz, sometimes it&#8217;s investing time with the same child or job-seeker from week to week. It might mean feeding a hungry family, or even traveling to the other side of the world to care for someone in need. No matter how you get involved, you&#8217;re sure to impact lives in the process&#8212;including your own.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
