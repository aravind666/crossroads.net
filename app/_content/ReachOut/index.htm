<p class="noPspace">God tells us to serve those in need. To love them, learn from them, fight for their freedom. So we mobilize hundreds of people&mdash;sometimes thousands&mdash;and we respond to God&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Sometimes it&rsquo;s a one-day citywide blitz, sometimes it&rsquo;s investing time with the same child or job-seeker from week to week. It might mean feeding a hungry family, or even traveling to the other side of the world to care for someone in need. No matter how you get involved, you&rsquo;re sure to impact lives in the process&mdash;including your own.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
