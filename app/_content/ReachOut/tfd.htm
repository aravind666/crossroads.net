					<h2>Thanksgiving Food Drive</h2><span class="first">Reach out this holiday by providing meals to families in Cincinnati, in Mamelodi, South Africa, or both.</span><br /><br />For the last 12 years, Crossroads has collected food during the Thanksgiving season and distributed it to local Cincinnati churches so that they can be a blessing to their communities. We also ship food to our partner church in Mamelodi, South Africa, so that they can do the same. <strong>We'll feed thousands of people here and across the world.</strong> And you can help. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.crossroads.net/index.php?action=viewpage&amp;filepath=pages/my/Serve/Reachout/ThanksgivingFoodDrive.htm" title="thanksgiving food drive">Click here</a> for more info about the Thanksgiving Food Drive, and to read the Cincinnati shopping list. <em>(If you're not signed in, you'll be prompted to do so, or register.)</em><br /><a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/ThanksgivingFoodDrive.htm" title="Thanksgiving Food Drive"><br /></a>
