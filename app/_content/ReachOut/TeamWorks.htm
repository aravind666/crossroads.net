			<h2>ReachOut: TeamWorks Job Mentoring</h2><span class="first">Walk with someone as they move from unemployment to self-sufficiency. </span><br /><br />Poverty continues to be one of our city&rsquo;s biggest problems. Studies recently showed that Cincinnati has risen to the third poorest city in the U.S., with nearly 28% of our residents living below the poverty line (a 35% increase since 2000).<br /><br />But through TeamWorks Job Mentoring, you can support people who want to keep a steady job and improve their lives. <strong>You can help to break the cycles of generational poverty, one life at a time</strong>.<br /><ul><li>TeamWorks mentors commit to a one-year relationship with their mentee. Mentors serve as a good sounding board and reference point for employment, personal and spiritual issues. </li><li>Mentors are supported by a team of other mentor-mentee pairs, so you&rsquo;re not left to do it on your own.</li><li>Volunteers are also needed to serve as mock interviewers and job searchers. </li><li>We provide training and ongoing support.</li><li>TeamWorks is led in partnership with <a href="http://www.cincinnatiworks.org/" title="Cincinnati Works">Cincinnati Works</a> and <a href="http://www.onecity.org" title="OneCity">OneCity</a>. </li></ul><p><strong><a href="/mysend/30" title="Email TeamWorks">Email us</a> with questions or to sign up for training.</strong></p><div id="crc_video_media_2" align="middle">
