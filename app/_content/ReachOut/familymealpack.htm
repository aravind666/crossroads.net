<p class="header noPspace">Family Meal Pack</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Serving up 300,000 meals for our partners in South Africa</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Join us on Saturday, July 12 for the 1st Annual Family Meal Pack event at all four sites. Families will help assemble 300,000 meals (yeah, that&rsquo;s five zeros)&nbsp;that will ultimately get shipped to our friends and partners at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.topsy.org.za/" target="_blank">Topsy Foundation</a>&nbsp;in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Each pack is a meal for six people, and includes rice, vegetables, soy protein and vitamin powder. In order to accomplish our first year goal, there are a number of serving opportunities that are required &nbsp;and we encourage you to invite your friends.&nbsp;Whether you&rsquo;d like to&nbsp;serve in one our supporting roles (e.g. clean-up crew, table leader, greeters, etc.) or help assemble meals, sign up below at the site that suits you best.&nbsp;</div>
