<span class="first">We call it HOST Mamelodi. They call it GO Cincinnati. No matter what we call it, we know we&#8217;ll never be the same.</span>
<br><br>We&#8217;ll host 50 (or more) friends from South Africa again this September, and we couldn&#8217;t do it
without you and your generous spirit of hospitality. Our Mamelodi guests will arrive in Cincinnati on<br>
<strong>Thursday, September 24</strong> and leave Cincinnati on<strong> Monday, October 5</strong>.
Because we realize hosting someone in your home for 11 days is a lot to ask, we&#8217;ve done a couple things to make it easier. <br>&#160;
<br>We&#8217;ve split the <strong>Overnight Host</strong> role into two shifts: Thursday, September 24 &#8211; Tuesday, September 29 and
Wednesday, September 30 &#8211; Monday, October 5.<br>&#160;<br>There&#8217;s also an opportunity to spend time with our friends from
Mamelodi during the day(s). We&#8217;re calling that role a <strong>Hospitality Volunteer</strong>. You won&#8217;t host guests in your home
or be responsible for a specific person,<br>but you&#8217;ll be offering hospitality to our guests at events happening while they are here.
<br><br>You can sign up to be an Overnight Host for the entire period, but just know up front that we might not be able to accommodate that request. 
Ditto for hosting specific friends from Mamelodi&#8211;we won&#8217;t know for sure who is coming until closer to their arrival date due to visas,
passports and other travel details. Give us your preferences on the sign-up form below (under special needs/concerns) and we&#8217;ll do the best we can.
<br><br>Pastor Titus and his church members from Charity and Faith are working hard to save and raise enough money to pay for their own plane tickets.
We&#8217;ve told them that lodging, food and transportation will be covered while they are staying in our homes, so while there is no official &#8220;cost&#8221;
to be an Overnight Host, we do ask that you be willing to provide these.<br><br>Our mantra again this year is BE GUMBY (translation: be flexible).
As you know, it&#8217;s also our GO Mamelodi mantra. Plans will change, special accommodations will need to be made, and we&#8217;re sure things won&#8217;t
always run like clockwork. But that&#8217;s the place where a program ends and a relationship begins, and God works through relationships, not programs.
So let go and Be Gumby.<br><br>For answers to frequently asked questions,

Just as a reminder, the deadline for signing up to host is July 6th. At
that point we&#8217;ll send a confirmation email to everyone who is signed
up, and we&#8217;ll be following up periodically with additional details.</em><br><br><strong>Ready? Sign up below to HOST Mamelodi.</strong><br><br>
