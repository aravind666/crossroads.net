<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Over the past several years, Crossroads has partnered with <a title="IJM" href="http://ijm.org/">other organizations</a> to combat sex trafficking. Every year in India, millions of men, women and children are trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs estimates that 90 percent of India&rsquo;s sex trafficking is internal. And in Mumbai, the third largest city in the world, in just one of its red light districts, there are an estimated 60,000 sex workers who get the equivalent of $1.50 for sex, $2 on a good night, and less than a dollar on a bad night.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Our partners in India have been working relentlessly to bring justice and rescue to girls who are trapped in one of the most egregious forms of modern day slavery. From afar, we have provided financial support, prayed for rescue, sent care packages and hosted the heroes who have been working on the front lines to rescue girls from forced prostitution. Now we are working alongside the local Indian church as they journey into providing housing, education, job readiness, social enterprise and community to rescued survivors of trafficking making the bold move to sustainable independence.&nbsp;</p>
