<p class="header noPspace">Thanksgiving Food Drive</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">God says to serve the poor. So we do.&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Every year, we collect food&#8211;lots of food&#8211;and give it to our partners locally and in South Africa so that they can bless those in need.&#160;<span style="line-height: 1.75;">We&#8217;ll be in the Atriums giving out boxes after the services during the weekends of November 9-10 and November 16-17.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">On November 23-24, we&#8217;ll collect boxes before the services in and around our three sites.&#160;All serving roles at all sites are full for box collection next week.&#160;</p>

<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Please:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">NO fresh, bloody turkeys (ick) &#8211; we MUST have frozen turkeys</p>

<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>South Africa boxes &#8211; bulk food items:</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Your shopping list is taped to your box. If you lose your shopping list, look at the stickers on each box. Buy only the exact items listed on the sticker on each box. We must have only these items to pass our customs inspection. Any item included in the box that deviates from the sticker cannot be shipped and that would just be sad.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>SHOP EARLY!</strong> Many stores, especially the stores closest to Oakley, run very low on quantities close to our box collection dates.&#160;</p>

<p class="noPspace">In need of assistance during Thanksgiving? While Crossroads does not have a Thanksgiving food program that is open to the public (all boxes have already been distributed to pre-designated churches and charities), we do help host a meal on Thanksgiving Day called Fall Feast and all are welcome.&#160;Doors open at the Duke Energy Center at 5th and Elm Street in downtown Cincinnati at 10am for free services including: a wellness medical clinic including flu shots, vision screening, and haircuts. Free coats for men, women and children are also available. A fantastic meal accompanied by live music is served from 11am to 2pm.&#160;</p>
