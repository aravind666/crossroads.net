<p class="header noPspace">Give Time</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">It might be the best investment you&#8217;ll ever make.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Whether you can give a day or 52 weeks, there are lots of ways for you to get involved. Try out some of these opportunities, until you find one that really fits.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="Angel Tree" href="">Angel Tree</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Help our community bless kids in need with a gift at Christmas by calling the children&#8217;s caregivers, helping people select gift tags from trees in the Atrium, organizing gifts or delivering presents.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="The Diner" href="">The Diner</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Help us serve meals to the hungry. We go restaurant-style at City Gospel Mission: delivering meals to the table and eating alongside those who come in. So come serve dinner on the second, third, fourth or fifth Fridays of each month, or breakfast on the fifth Saturdays. It&#8217;s low-commitment, high-impact.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="GO Cincinnati" href="">GO Cincinnati</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">We need people with muscles, people who can organize, people who love to get dirty and people who love to help with our annual citywide service project. In four hours on a Saturday in May, we tackle over 400 projects at schools, social agencies, parks, neighborhoods and churches all over town.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="Habitat" href="">Habitat for Humanity</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">We also believe simple, decent, affordable housing for everyone is something God cares about deeply. Hang drywall, power-saw, even make food for the work site. Help build homes and relationships with low-income families on Saturdays. No prior construction experience needed (but if you&#8217;ve got it, we&#8217;ll take it).</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a href="" target="_blank">India Engagement</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Join a community of volunteers supporting our efforts in India, fighting for freedom of an estimated 1.2 million children currently trapped in forced prostitution. Sign up to receive updates on the work being done in India, learn about GO-ing on a trip or volunteer to pray for this life-altering movement.&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="The Outlet" href="">The Outlet</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Hang out with us at City Gospel Mission&#8217;s game room on Saturday mornings (9am-noon) and the first and third Sundays of the month (1-4pm). Drink coffee, shoot pool, play Spades. Engage with homeless people looking for a positive, friendly place to be. Come once or keep coming.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="Fall Feast" href="">Thanksgiving Day Fall Feast</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Join with volunteers across the city to prepare, serve and share Thanksgiving dinner with people who might not otherwise enjoy one, deliver meals to the elderly and shut-in unable to join the feast downtown, or help serve meals at a nursing home, shelter or other care facility.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="sectionHeader noPspace"><a title="Thanksgiving Food Drive" href="">Thanksgiving Food Drive</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Every year our community provides meals for thousands of families, and we need lots of support to make it happen. Help by distributing boxes and shopping lists in the Atrium, or collecting filled boxes during one of the biggest parking lot parties you&#8217;ll ever see.</p>
