<h2>ReachOut: StepUp Prison Mentoring</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Help someone pursure a second chance and a fresh start. </span><br><br>StepUp is a mentoring program assisting residents at River City Correctional Facility and Talbert House in making a positive transition back into society. Moving from a correctional facility to freedom is a chance for a new beginning, but is often a difficult transition. Individuals may have to re-establish many elements of basic life&#8212;living situation, employment, relationships with family and friends. In some cases, individuals leave prison without knowing what their next step will be and without a landing place.</p>
<ul>
<li>StepUp mentors commit to a one-year relationship with their mentee: three months before they&#8217;re released and the first&#160;nine months of their freedom.</li>
<li>Mentors help their mentees re-invent their future by being supported and encouraged, through one-on-one relationship. </li>
<li>Training and ongoing support are provided. </li>
<li>StepUp is led in partnership with <a title="Jobs Plus" href="">Jobs Plus</a> and <a title="OneCity" href="">OneCity</a>.</li>
