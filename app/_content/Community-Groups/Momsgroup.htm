<p class="header noPspace">Moms</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Being a Mom is a privilege that is both amazing and hard. It challenges us, grows us and sometimes even kicks our butt. The beauty is God can use this gift, to teach us about his character and how he feels about us. And He wants us to be a strong influencer in our family and train kids to experience his goodness too.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"> </p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Even on good days this responsibility can seem overwhelming. Thank goodness God doesn’t want us to do it alone. Community is a necessary element in this journey of motherhood. Join other moms who want to know God more while learning practical skills for parenting.</p>
