<p class="noPspace header">Dwell</p>
<p class="noPspace">A small group + individual experience </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Welcome to this small group experience called Dwell—a seven-part study about connecting more deeply with God, and making the relationship that you have with him a part of your everyday rhythm. It’s a great way for Journey Home small groups to pick up where they left off—or for new people to jump in.</p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Each week, your group will meet for approximately 1 ½ hours. You’ll read some things out loud, ask questions and have good conversations. In between these group meetings, you’ll have some individual work to do. And it’s all tucked into one guide. </p>
<p class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace">Dwell isn’t an all-church journey—so the weekend teaching isn’t going to line up with it—but we’ll provide printed guides that have both the small group and individual material combined into one. We went hybrid, folks. Guides will be available at Info Centers at all 3 sites on the weekend of Jan 26-27. Or you can download this seven-week study <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/dwell_final_lores.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
