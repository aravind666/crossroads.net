<p class="noPspace header">Dwell</p>
<p class="noPspace">A small group + individual experience&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Welcome to this small group experience called Dwell&#8212;a seven-part study about connecting more deeply with God, and making the relationship that you have with him a part of your everyday rhythm.&#160;It&#8217;s a great way for Journey Home small groups to pick up where they left off&#8212;or for new people to jump in.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Each week, your group will meet for approximately 1 &#189; hours. You&#8217;ll read some things out loud, ask questions and have good conversations. In between these group meetings, you&#8217;ll have some individual work to do. And it&#8217;s all tucked into&#160;one guide.&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Dwell isn&#8217;t an all-church journey&#8212;so the weekend teaching isn&#8217;t going to line up with it&#8212;but we&#8217;ll provide printed guides that have both the small group and individual material combined into one. We went hybrid, folks. Guides will be available at Info Centers at all 3 sites on the weekend of Jan 26-27. Or you can download this seven-week study&#160;<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/dwell_final_lores.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160;</p>
