<h2>Men&rsquo;s CST (Childhood Sexual Trauma)</h2>
<div id="_mcePaste" class="subheading">Mondays,&nbsp;6:30&ndash;8:30pm</div>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">A safe place for men to understand how to deal with the pain and isolation caused from childhood sexual trauma. We&rsquo;ll explore the healthy relationships we need to recover, and journey together toward freedom and joy.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Your need for privacy and anonymity will be protected. The room will be marked simply "CST." No nametags, and no one will be asked to speak. You can just listen, or if more interaction is desired, a team will be available after each lecture for prayer and discussion.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">It is possible to break the generational cycle of abuse and dysfunction through prayer, relationships with friends and a support network. Discover more about this process of healing, how God works in the midst of it, and how we can get help and healing when we&rsquo;re ready.</p>
