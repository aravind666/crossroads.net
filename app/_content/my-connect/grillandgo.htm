<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Last year, Crossroads Florence hosted the first ever "Grill &amp; Go" and this year, the West Side wanted in on the action. Join us for the &#8220;Grill &amp; Go&#8221; Connect Event&#8212;a great opportunity for folks in our community to build relationships and make this place feel a bit smaller.&#160;So grab your flip flops, shades and join the fun.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s how this event works:</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- Everyone will split up into groups of 8-10 in Florence; 4-5 in West Side.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">- Each group will be assigned to a dedicated host who will serve up a tasty meal in their home. Upon signing up, you&#8217;ll receive additional&#160;details prior to the event.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">- Guests will arrive at their host&#8217;s house between&#160;6&#8211;6:30pm.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">- After dinner, you&#8217;ll head back to your&#160;Crossroads site for drinks and dessert in the atrium.</p>
