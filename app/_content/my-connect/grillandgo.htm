<p class="header noPspace" dir="ltr">&#8220;Grill &amp; Go&#8221; Connect Event</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Crossroads Florence will be hosting their 1st Annual &#8220;Grill &amp; Go&#8221; Connect Event on August 9. This adult-only event will be a great opportunity for folks in our community to build relationships and make this place feel a bit smaller. It&#8217;s not that we don&#8217;t like kids, we just want the adults to have a chance to actually connect.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Now that your taste buds are beginning to swell up, this is how the evening will go down.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- Depending on the number of RSVPs, everyone will split up into groups of 8-10.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- Each group will be assigned to a dedicated host who will be serving up a tasty meal at their house. Upon signing up, details for the event will go out the week of July 29.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- Guests will arrive at their host&#8217;s house between 6:00&#8211;6:30pm. Hosts will provide the meat and all other participants will be asked to bring a side dish. After dinner, Crossroads Florence will be serving up dessert in the atrium at 8PM for all Grill &amp; Go participants. The e</span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">vent should conclude around 10pm.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">So grab your flip flops and shades and join in the fun. It will be an evening where new friendships will be formed and our community will bond together.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">Note &#8211; the deadline to signup was Tuesday, July 30.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">&#160;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Families, couples and singles are encouraged.&#160;If you&#8217;d like to be a host, all you need is a grill and the willingness to invite some new friends into your home. &#160;</p>
