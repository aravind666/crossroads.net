<h2>CSM JR</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">An experiment to change our world through God's love.</span><br><br>And when we say "experiment"...we mean it. Come check it out, and experience a new look at Bible, Prayer &amp; Community...CSM-style.<br><br></p>

<h3>CURRENT SERIES<strong> (Now through May 17)</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>PINEAPPLE.</strong><br>Just imagine the first person to discover the pineapple. It's not exactly a fruit you just pick up and take a bite out of...pretty rough, pretty sharp, not as easy to get to the good stuff...or even know it's in there. Sometimes following God is just like a pineapple...you've gotta push through all the rough stuff that is in the way in order to get to the unexpected sweetness on the inside. Come hang with us as we discover what pineapples can teach us about serving others. <a href="/mysend/98" target="_blank">click here</a> to contact Paul Owens if you've got any questions.<br><br></p>
