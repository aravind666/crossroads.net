<h2>Connection Events</h2>Held periodically throughout the year, these events connect those interested in getting into Small Groups with others. We set up tables in the Crossroads' Atrium, divided by neighborhoods, so you can find groups nearby your home or work. <br><br>Next one? It'll be a few weeks before the next church-wide Journey: late January / early February 2008. <br><br>You can also <a href="/my/connect/smallGroups/groups_small_group_search.php">Find A Small Group</a> here. <br>			</body></html>
