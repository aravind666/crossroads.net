<h2>Pursuit</h2>
<span class="first">20-somethings: Explore God. Meet some people.</span><br><br>Sometimes it seems like when we hit our 20s, everything changes. But God certainly doesn&#8217;t stop pursuing us in the midst of all the craziness. If anything, He steps it up a notch.<br><br>Pursuit is a place for 20-somethings to connect and grow with God and with each other.  We meet weekly to hang out, get to know each other and journey together in understanding what it means to have a God that loves us and pursues us.<br><br>We meet <strong>most Thursdays from 7-8:30pm at Crossroads</strong>. There's no registration necessary, just show up. <br><br><em>By the way, all you post-high school 18 and 19-year-olds are welcome, too. We just didn't like the way "18, 19 and 20-somethings" sounded.</em><br><br>						</body></html>
