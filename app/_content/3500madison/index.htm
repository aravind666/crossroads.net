<p class="noPspace"><strong>We&#8217;ve decided to scale back outside events at Crossroads, as we&#8217;re simplifying operations and shifting resources to accommodate other ministry priorities.</strong> If a Crossroads staff person is involved with your event or organization, you may want to ask them to sponsor your event. For events that have a staff sponsor, we&#8217;ll make decisions on a case-by-case basis.<br> <br> Thanks for your interest. Please see our <a title="Alternative Venues" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/documents/alternative_venues.pdf">list of alternative venues</a> for other options.</p>
