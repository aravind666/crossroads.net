<h2>Finance</h2>
<span class="first">Many believe the Bible says "money is the root of all evil."</span><br><br>Not true. What it actually says is "the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8230;" (1 Timothy 6:10) Well, we don&#8217;t "love" it, we just "like it as a friend." Here&#8217;s how finances work at Crossroads:<br><ol>
<li>Generous people in our community love contributing to the things they see God doing around here. So they give, and <strong>we use that money to bless others</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>We base our budget on what we believe God wants</strong>, not on what we think we&#8217;ll get.</li>
<li>
<strong>Money gets spent here, not stashed.</strong> People give to Crossroads so we can build into the community, not a mutual fund.</li>
<li>And volunteers? They keep us afloat.</li>
</ol>Our books are open, so ask us anything. Or, learn more about <a href="" title="Give">ways to give</a>.<br>					</body></html>
