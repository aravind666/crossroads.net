    </div>	<h2>Seven Hills We Die On</h2>
<span class="first">Cincinnati is known as the city of seven hills.</span><br><br>Crossroads has seven hills, as well—we call them the seven hills we die on. Simply calling these "values" doesn’t cut it. All too commonly, values have come to signify mushy, sentimental ideals for which we rarely fight. As a church, we believe that if something is worth living for, it is worth dying for. We realize we can’t do everything—but what we, as a community, are called by God to do, we do with excellence.<br> <br>The Seven Hills We Die On are applications of biblical truth expressed through the unique personality of Crossroads. We remember these seven hills as ABCDERG (we really did try to find an "F" that worked and was appropriate, but finally gave up and went on to bigger things).<br> <br><strong>Authenticity</strong> <br>We believe we can’t be what God has called us to be if we play games with each other. Whether it’s what happens on stage, within our smaller communities, in serving teams or in our homes, we need to be able to share our faults and weaknesses and not fake it. That’s authenticity, just being real.<br>(From Philippians 3:17 in the Bible) <br> <br><strong>Biblical Truth</strong> <br>Crossroads is a place for people on every part of the spiritual journey, from those just investigating whether there is a God to those who have made following Christ the priority of their life. The Bible presents a dangerous message of life change. We don’t assume everyone believes, or even knows the Bible, but we do assume everyone who comes through our doors is open to exploring it. We believe the Bible is God’s inerrant truth and it’s the foundation to everything we do. <br>(From 2 Timothy 3:16 in the Bible)<br> <br><strong>Culturally Current Communication</strong> <br>Crossroads is a place that helps connect those who are exploring God’s love and truth. The challenge for us is that the Bible was written a long time ago for people in another culture. The fact that we live in 21st century Cincinnati doesn’t change the message that God gave 2000 years ago, but it does mean that we need to do some work to connect it to our lives today. Jesus did exactly the same thing when he was teaching. He used the current language and daily life experiences of those around him to communicate truth. That’s what we mean by “culturally current communication.”<br>(From Ecclesiastes 12:10 in the Bible)<br> <br><strong>Doing Life Together</strong> <br>We aren’t interested in being a place where a lot of people get together for an inspiring service but never move beyond the casual, arm's distance relationships of an auditorium. We want to grow by really “doing life together.” People who grow in their relationship with God also grow in their friendships with each other, moving beyond the Auditorium in small groups, Community Groups and through serving. Real community is knowing and being known, loving and being loved, celebrating and being celebrated, serving and being served.<br>(From Hebrews 10:24-25 in the Bible) <br> <br><strong>Excellence</strong> <br>We don’t believe in striving for unrealistic perfection. Real excellence is about bringing your best to God’s work and to life in general. We want to bring our “A-game” to everything that we do, whether it’s our communication and music, how we hold babies in the nursery or how we take care of the building, we want it to reflect excellence for Christ. <br>(From Malachi 1 in the Bible)  <br> <br><strong>Reproduction</strong> <br>Reproduction is about recognizing something that God has created and then reproducing it in his name. We want to send God’s message out into the world by reproducing everything from the weekend program to CDs of each message series. Crossroads wants to be a place where Christ-followers reproduce Christ-followers, leaders reproduce leaders and churches reproduce other churches.<br>(From Matthew 28:19-20 in the Bible)  <br> <br><strong>Growth </strong><br>We don’t expect anyone who walks into Crossroads to be a committed Christ-follower, but we do expect everyone who is around our community for any length of time to be growing. We expect every person to be moving closer to reflecting the complete image of Christ in every area of life. This is a safe place for everyone. But safe doesn’t mean comfortable. The answers aren’t always comfortable. In fact, we often grow only when we are pushed out of our comfort zone.<br>(From Colossians 1:10 in the Bible) <br>
