    Spiritual growth isn't one-size-fits-all, but here are some recommended steps for being intentional about your personal growth.
    <strong>We call these steps the "Three Staples of Growth":</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Attend the Weekend Experience</h3>
        Connect with others to explore questions about God and the Bible,
        and be challenged to apply what you learn to your life.
        Here are <a title="Service Times &amp; Directions" href="/about/serviceTimes.php">service times and directions</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><a title="Subscribe to The Daily via Email" href="/my/grow/theDailySignup.php">Subscribe to “The Daily”</a></h3>
        Spend time with God on a daily basis. We make it easy for you with The Daily,
        a tool that enables you to engage with the Bible and prayer regularly.
        Able to be completed in just 15 minutes, each day follows a simple format of reading,
        reflection and response. You can <a title="Subscribe to The Daily" href="/my/grow/theDailySignup.php">subscribe to receive The Daily</a>
        via e-mail, or <a title="The Daily" href="/my/daily.php">read it online</a>. <em>(You'll be prompted to sign in or register for crossroads.net.)</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Join a Small(er) Group</h3>
        We weren’t meant to do life alone. Join a <a title="Small Groups" href="/getInvolved/smallGroups.php">small group</a>
        or a <a title="Community Groups" href="/getInvolved/communityGroups.php">Community Group</a> to grow closer to God as you grow closer to others in community.
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="noPspace">
    <br>In addition to the three recommended staples of growth, there are also many
    <a title="Growth Catalysts" href="/index.php?action=viewpage&amp;filepath=pages/grow/growthcatalyst.htm">growth catalysts</a> that can mark milestones on your journey to help turbo-charge your spiritual growth.</p>
