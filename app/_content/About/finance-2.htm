<span class="first">Many believe the Bible says “money is the root of all evil.”</span><br><br>Not true. What it actually says is “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil…” (1 Timothy 6:10) Well, we don’t “love” it, we just “like it as a friend.” Here’s how finances work at Crossroads:<br><ol>
<li>Generous people in our community love contributing to the things they see God doing around here. So they give, and <strong>we use that money to bless others</strong>.    </li>
<li>
<strong>We base our budget on what we believe God wants</strong>, not on what we think we’ll get.</li>
<li>
<strong>Money gets spent here, not stashed</strong>. People give to Crossroads so we can build into the community, not a mutual fund.</li>
</ol>
