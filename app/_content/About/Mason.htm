<p class="noPspace"><span class="sectionHeader">About</span></p>
<p class="noPspace">A group of Crossroads folks who live in the Mason and West Chester areas decided they wanted a place to invite their friends who&#8217;d given up on church, but not on God. And they didn&#8217;t want to ask their neighbors to drive 30+ minutes each way to check it out. Voila: Crossroads Mason. It&#8217;s a place to experience truths from the Bible in a practical and relevant way, to ask questions, and to connect with others.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Services in Mason take place on Sunday, showing the message from Oakley from the night before (via DVD on some very large screens). Everything else is live&#8212;Kids&#8217; Club, First Impressions, the music and, of course, the coffee. Crossroads Mason also has its own campus leader available to connect with people each weekend.</p>
