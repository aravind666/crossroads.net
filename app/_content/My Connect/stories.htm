			<span class="Apple-style-span">	<h2>Stories</h2><strong class="first">Read about others' experiences, or share your own.<br /><br /></strong>You can post your story for others to see, or just send it privately to us. Share what you&rsquo;ve gone through, what&rsquo;s been helpful or why you&rsquo;re joy-filled. Sometimes we all just need to get a few words out&mdash;to process, start healing, or connect with others. Sometimes we&rsquo;ve healed or found answers, and want others to feel hope.    <br /><br />(add STORY TOOL and STORIES to start it out.)  <br />		</span>
