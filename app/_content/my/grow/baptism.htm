<h1>Baptism</h1>
<h2 class="subheading">Say it loud.</h2>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Being baptized means you’ve decided to accept and follow Jesus, and are ready to declare that decision publicly. Baptism is kind of like a wedding ring: it’s an outward symbol of an inward commitment to something bigger than oneself. It shows we identify with Christ’s death and resurrection into new life. Your decision to be baptized or to have your child baptized is one of the most important decisions of your life, second only to your decision to follow Christ.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">FAQs</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Who can baptize me?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Anyone you want, provided that person is a Christ-follower who has already been baptized (whether that’s family, a friend, a serving team leader or a baptism staff member).</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>How many community baptisms are there each year?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We have two sign-up baptisms each year, during our Last Wednesday service, and another open-call baptism during weekend services.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Will I get wet?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">You better believe it. We baptize via full water immersion, unless we’re baptizing infants or someone with physical or health limitations.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Dark clothes, and bring extra clothes to change into.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>What if I’ve been baptized before?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Many people are baptized as infants or as young children, as an act of faith by their parents. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with that,because baptism represents a commitment to Jesus Christ, it’s a decision that people must make for themselves. So, if you were baptized when you were too young to have made the decision yourself, or you did it because everyone else in the youth group was doing it, then go for it. If you’re wondering if it “took” when you got baptized at the last Crossroads baptism, it doesn’t wash off, and you’re probably good.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Do I have to be baptized at Crossroads?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Nope. You can be baptized anywhere there’s enough water to get dunked; a swimming pool, a lake, even the Ohio River if you’re brave. Please note that Crossroads staff cannot accommodate off-site baptisms.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Do I have to be baptized at Crossroads to be a member? </strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">Nope. Crossroads does not have membership.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Community Baptism</strong></p>
