<p class="noPspace"><strong>Monday, May 6 at 5pm was our sign up deadline. We currently have enough volunteers at this time. If you did sign up, you&rsquo;ll receive an email between May 10-15 confirming all details.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>We love Cincinnati. (All of it.)</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">And that love extends way beyond the city limits&mdash;we&rsquo;re spreading it from Burlington to Middletown and all the neighborhoods in between. <strong>We call it GO Cincinnati</strong> because we take on projects all over the region. And let&rsquo;s face it, GO Flomasoak doesn&rsquo;t really flow off the tongue. So GO Cincinnati it is, and this is how we do it: a one-day compassion blitz, investing our love into hundreds of work projects all over town.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">In 2012, 6,000 of us from 50 churches got dirty and sweaty, with paint-splattered hands and mulch-stained shirts, at one of hundreds of projects. And while all the projects were different, one similarity stood out: everyone helped bring hope and life to something that previously seemed hopeless and lifeless. New flowers replaced weeds. Vibrant murals covered dirty walls.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><strong>This year, we&rsquo;ll GO bigger and better than ever on Saturday, May 18, 9am-1pm. Will you?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">If you have a friend who is officially leading a project (GO Cincinnati project leaders are called Team Captains) and want to be on their team simply answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the question on the sign up form &ldquo;Are you serving with a group&rdquo; and select their name from the list of &ldquo;Group Connector&rdquo; names that pop up. You&rsquo;ll receive an email between May 10-15 confirming all details.</p>
