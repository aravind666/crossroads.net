<br /><br /><span class="first">Start here with questions about GO Cincinnati.</span>
<br /><br /><strong>What if I want to serve on a project with my friends, my Reset group or my family?</strong>
<br />Great. We love groups. Just follow these 5 easy steps:<br />
<ol>
    <li>Talk to your friends and family, and decide who will be in your group.</li>
    <li>Pick a first, second and third choice of project type that works for everyone.
        We try to make projects kid-friendly but if you're not sure your kids would have fun helping, you might want to make other arrangements for them that day. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Pick one member of the group to be your Group Connector (and make sure everyone knows who that is).</li>
    <li>The person named as Group Connector should sign up first, answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Are you serving with a group?&quot;, name themselves as Group Connector and pick the group's first, second and third choice of project type.</li>
    <li>Everyone in the group then signs up, also answering &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Are you serving with a group?&quot; and then selects the Group Connector's name from a list of possible choices.</li>
</ol>
<strong><br />What if I have a friend who is leading a project?</strong><br />Answer &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;are you serving with a group?&quot; and select their name from the list of Group Connector names, and you'll be placed on their team.<br /><br /><strong>Should each member of our family sign up separately?</strong><br />No. Just one sign-up per family if you'd all like to serve on the same project, please.<br /><br /><strong>What about my kids? Can they serve with me?</strong><br />Sure, just choose a project that's age-appropriate. Here's a list of project types and the ages that are OK:<br /><ul><li>Artistic Painting &ndash; children 13 and older</li><li>Construction &ndash; children 13 and older</li><li>Gardening &ndash; children 2 and older</li><li>Landscaping &ndash; children 8 and older</li><li>Organization/CleanUp &ndash; children 2 and older</li><li>Painting &ndash; children 8 and older</li><li>Praying &ndash; children 8 and older</li><li>Serving Meals &ndash; children 8 and older</li><li>Working with Children &ndash; children 2 and older</li><li>Working with Elderly &ndash; children 2 and older</li></ul><strong><br />Are there any projects for people with physical limitations? </strong><br />Almost all projects involve physical work but a limited few do not. <a href="/send/120" title="Email GO Cincinnati">E-mail us</a> and we'll let you know some options.<br /><br /><strong>How do I know what project I'm assigned to after I sign up? </strong><br />You'll receive an e-mail the week before the event, but not before, so please don't ask. The e-mail will give you all of the details about your project. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Still have questions?</strong> <a href="/send/120" title="Email GO Cincinnati">E-mail us</a> or call 513.731.7400 x384.
