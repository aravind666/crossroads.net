                <h3>Last year’s journey participants reported:</h3>
<ul>
<li>93% were part of a small group—and for 59%, it was their first time</li>
<li>80% of small groups planned to continue meeting on their own</li>
<li>95% thought it was worth doing</li>
<li>92% found it enjoyable</li>
<li>89% said it was personally challenging</li>
<li>89% stated it would affect their future decisions</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mobilize your church community around a shared experience and topic</li>
<li>Use professionally created print materials, video, family guides and other stuff—everything’s either free (design work, content, video) or provided at-cost (anything printed)</li>
<li>Build into (or launch) your small group ministry</li>
<li>Connect with other pastors and get energized during weekly brainstorms</li>
<li> Develop synergies with other churches</li>
<li>Be part of a city/region-wide movement</li>
</ul>            </div>

            	We’ve done campaigns/journeys on our own before, but to do this in partnership with other churches in the city was a phenomenal win. You guys should be proud of what you’ve launched in this city.
