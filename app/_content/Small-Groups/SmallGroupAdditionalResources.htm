<p class="normal noPspace">Dwell&#8212;a seven-part study about connecting more deeply with God, and making the relationship that you have with him a part of your everyday rhythm.&#160;It&#8217;s a great way for Journey Home small groups to pick up where they left off&#8212;or for new people to jump in.</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Each week, your group will meet for approximately 1 &#189; hours. You&#8217;ll read some things out loud, ask questions and have good conversations. In between these group meetings, you&#8217;ll have some individual work to do. And it&#8217;s all tucked into&#160;one guide.&#160;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="normal noPspace">Dwell isn&#8217;t an all-church journey&#8212;so the weekend teaching isn&#8217;t going to line up with it&#8212;but we&#8217;ll provide printed guides that have both the small group and individual material combined into one. We went hybrid, folks. Guides are available at Info Centers at all 3 sites. Or you can download this seven-week study&#160;<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/dwell_final_lores.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160;</p>

If your group is interested in getting into the Bible, but isn&#8217;t confident in your ability to stay focused without some structure to guide you, the Serendipity Bible may be a good option to check out.<br><strong><br>Twisting the Truth&#8212;Learning to Discern in a Culture of Deception</strong><br>by Andy Stanley<br>The most dangerous lies are the ones you never notice. Andy Stanley talks about how common but deadly deceptions impact you every day, and how the ability to recognize them can spell the difference between happiness and the loss of everything you value. This study seeks to bring light to the common ways that God&#8217;s truth gets twisted. Lies can destroy relationships, cloud discernment and distort the perception of God. This study seeks to teach people how to recognize those distortions and overcome them.<br><br><strong>Crazy Love</strong><br>by Francis Chan<br>It&#8217;s crazy. The God of the universe loves us with a passionate, relentlessly overwhelming love. And how do we respond? We go to church. We sing a few songs, and we try not to cuss. This study begs to argue that God wants more. He wants a passionate love relationship. This study teaches that the answer to religious complacency doesn&#8217;t hinge upon rules or something else to put on your Not-to-Do list. It has everything to do with falling in love with God, and living out a lifestyle transformed by his love.<br><br><strong>Prodigal God</strong><br>by Timothy Keller<br>A six-week experience for churches and small groups. Based on Jesus&#8217; parable of the prodigal son, this book, teaching film and discussion guide from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Timothy Keller, illustrates his core message that the gospel is neither religion nor irreligion, neither morality or immorality, but something else entirely. Both younger brothers and elder brothers in your church or group will realize that the only way home is through a prodigal God.<br><strong><br>Sacred Marriage</strong><br>by Gary L. Thomas<br>What if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy? This book will help you to understand the Lord&#8217;s intention for matrimony by detailing how, as husband and wife, you can more holistically reflect the character of Christ. Don&#8217;t miss this opportunity to learn how God wants to use your marriage as a spiritual discipline to draw you closer to him.<br><br><strong>Invisible War</strong><br>by Chip Ingram<br>What every believer needs to know about spiritual warfare. Chip Ingram takes you through an eight-session series on what the Bible teaches about spiritual warfare, how to recognize it and how to fight it.</span><br></span></p>
