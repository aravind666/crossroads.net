<h2>Small Group Hosting</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Start doing life with others. </span><br><br>God uses intimate connections with other people as catalysts for change—is us, in our relationships with him and others, in our families and in the world. But sometimes people need a lot of encouragement to begin building community. So if you want to bring people together in a simple way, try hosting a Small Group. <br><br><strong>How do I start?</strong><br>There are many ways: ask people you already know, meet new people in a <a href="/getInvolved/communityGroups.htm">Community Group</a> and branch off, do some <a href="/my/serve/reachOut.htm">ReachOut events</a>,  or check out <a href="/my/connect/smallGroups/groups_small_group_search.php">Find-A-Small-Group</a>. <br><br><strong>How many people make a Small Group?</strong><br>There’s no perfect number, but we’ve found that 4-12 people seems to work best for communication and trust-building. <br><br><strong>Do groups last forever?</strong><br>Some Small Groups meet for years—others meet for a season around a specific issue. It’s OK to end a Small Group that’s no longer effective in growing its members. Check out <a href="/my/Connect/SmallGroups/5CharacteristicsofaSmallGroup.htm">The Five Elements</a> of a thriving Small Group and see how your’e doing. <br><br><strong>What materials do I start with?</strong><br>Every Spring, Crossroads starts a community-wide <a href="/my/Connect/SmallGroups/Resources/TheJourney/CurrentJourney.htm">Journey</a> for all Small Groups.
