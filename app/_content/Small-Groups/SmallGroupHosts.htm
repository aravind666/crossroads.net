<h2>Small Group Hosting</h2>
<p class="noPspace"><span class="first">Start doing life with others. </span><br /><br />God uses intimate connections with other people as catalysts for change&mdash;is us, in our relationships with him and others, in our families and in the world. But sometimes people need a lot of encouragement to begin building community. So if you want to bring people together in a simple way, try hosting a Small Group. <br /><br /><strong>How do I start?</strong><br />There are many ways: ask people you already know, meet new people in a <a href="/getInvolved/communityGroups.htm">Community Group</a> and branch off, do some <a href="/my/serve/reachOut.htm">ReachOut events</a>,&nbsp; or check out <a href="/my/connect/smallGroups/groups_small_group_search.php">Find-A-Small-Group</a>. <br /><br /><strong>How many people make a Small Group?</strong><br />There&rsquo;s no perfect number, but we&rsquo;ve found that 4-12 people seems to work best for communication and trust-building. <br /><br /><strong>Do groups last forever?</strong><br />Some Small Groups meet for years&mdash;others meet for a season around a specific issue. It&rsquo;s OK to end a Small Group that&rsquo;s no longer effective in growing its members.
