<h2>	Small Group FAQs			</h2>
<span class="first">What is a small group?</span><br>A small group is simply a group of people gathered together with the common desire for community and growth. They meet regularly, usually with weekly or bi-weekly meetings, and do life together in between. There isn't any right or wrong way to have a group. Small groups can be completely tailored to fit the needs of the individuals attending. We simply recommend that three things happen in the midst of your experience:<br><ol>
<li>Spiritual growth: We define spiritual growth as moving closer to Jesus and his way of living in every area of our lives. This doesn't happen through any magic formula. It could happen through studies or just conversations with other believers that sharpen your faith</li>
<li>Doing life together: Groups are not an add-on community or another thing on your calendar to squeeze in. They work best if you're actually friends outside the group. Hang out on weekends, include one another in special events, e-mail prayer requests throught the week, grab lunch together after church—stay connected.</li>
<li>Serving lifestyle: Maybe for your group this means volunteering on a team together at Crossroads, serving at City Gospel Mission on Friday nights, or even serving one another through free babysitting, mowing each other's lawns or providing meals during difficult times.</li>
</ol>
<span class="first">Where do we meet?</span><br>Homes typically serve as the best environment to really open up and go deeper into relationship. If that's not an option for your group, you can meet anywhere: Panera, Starbucks, a local park—the point is not where you are, but who you're with.<br><br><span class="first">How big should a group be?</span><br>Most people prefer groups of 6-10, but any group larger than 12 begins to suffer. We recommend starting with about 6-8 people and being open to adding new people to the group as you feel led. Once the group hits 10-12 (or whenever it starts feeling big), split or reproduce.<br><br><span class="first">Who should be in my small group?</span><br>That is completely up to you. Depending on personal preferences, groups can have a variety of demographics. Some prefer to be with people of their gender, age group or life stage, while others specifically prefer to be in a diverse group environment that challenges them to grow from interacting with people who are different from them.<br><br><span class="first">How do I find a group?</span><br>Try praying and asking God if there are people in your life that you're already in relationship with (friends, neighbors, co-workers) who you should invite, or if you should branch out, expand your horizons and make some new friends. If you decide you want to meet a whole new group of people or if you and a few people you know want to add some additional members, try posting your group on our <a href="/my/connect/smallGroups/groups_small_group_search.php" title="find a group">online tool</a>.<br><br><span class="first">What should we study?</span><br>Groups can benefit from a variety of different study options. Some prefer book studies, some like guided materials, some enjoy going through a portion of the Bible, and some just want Christian friends to discuss life together with. You can download free group materials from Crossroads or chose from a list of recommended resources available to purchase from outside vendors.<br><br><span class="first">What makes a healthy small group?</span><br>Glad you asked. There's a study available called the 5Es that discusses the five major elements to a thriving group experience. It includes group dynamics, roles with the group and other helpful tips. <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/documents/5e_Guide.pdf" title="5E guide">Click here</a> to download the study.<br>	</body></html>
