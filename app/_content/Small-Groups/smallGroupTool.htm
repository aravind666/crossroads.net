<p class="noPspace">If you&#8217;re interested in creating or adding members to a small group, create a small group posting. It will make it easier for other people with similar interests to find you. <br><br> Remember, you don&#8217;t need to be a bible expert or professional facilitator to host a group. You just need to be willing to put yourself out there and let others know about your group.</p>
