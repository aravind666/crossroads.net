Simply specify your preferences below, and then peruse the available group listings. (All questions are optional.) <br><br> Can&#8217;t find a group that meets your needs? Consider <a title="Post a Small Group" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/my/connect/smallGroups/hosts_small_group_form.php">creating your own</a> group post. Posting does not mean you have to lead the group; it helps others looking for groups find each other.
