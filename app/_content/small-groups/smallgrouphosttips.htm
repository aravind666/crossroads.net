<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Welcome.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Thanks for stepping forward to
host a small group. As a host, you will not only be walking alongside others as
they grow, but also are sure to find significant growth as well. Here are some tips
on how to host and support your group. You&#8217;ll find tips on how to handle
conflict within the group, as well as ideas for next steps. </span>



<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>



<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><br><h3>What is a host?</h3>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Being a host means that you are
willing to welcome a small group into your home (or another suitable location).
You don&#8217;t need to have all the answers, and we don&#8217;t expect you to be a Bible
expert or a professional facilitator. Your group should meet at an agreed-upon
time and place, and you should be prepared with an open mind, and in some
cases, a DVD player.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><br><p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Expect the unexpected.</p>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"></span><h3>
<strong style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Your Responsibilities</strong>

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span></strong>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">If you haven&#8217;t already, determine how you will
     form your group. You can form a new group or continue meeting with an
     existing serving team or small group. If you&#8217;re forming a new group, use
     the Find-A-Group tool at crossroads.net to describe yourself and your
     group. People will be able to find your group online and will contact you
     via e-mail. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Regardless
of the method you&#8217;ve chosen to form your group, you&#8217;ll want to contact them
prior to your first meeting to confirm your meeting time and location.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">If you&#8217;re meeting at your home, try running the vacuum for a change.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">At your first meeting, be sure to review the
     Small Group Ground Rules (when directed to do so) and ask everyone to sign
     them. This can also be a good opportunity to discuss how your group will
     handle childcare, conflicting schedules, et cetera.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Before each meeting, be sure that you&#8217;ve
     completed any homework or challenges, as outlined in your group study
     materials.</li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Have fun. Do what you&#8217;re told. Expect the unexpected. </li>
</ol>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Your group should be a safe place
for people, wherever they are on their spiritual journey. Be sure to respect
any and all questions, and let everyone know they&#8217;re welcome to explore the
series topics, even if they don&#8217;t agree with them.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br><br>Some people might uncover
experiences in their past that elicit emotion, even strong emotions. Be
respectful of them. People probably don&#8217;t want to be &#8220;fixed&#8221; or given advice.
Listen in an understanding way, and affirm them for their discovery and offer
them a time out for others to continue, as appropriate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><br><h3>Have Clear Expectations</h3>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Be sure that everyone knows your
role as a host. You&#8217;re there to help guide the discussion, but aren&#8217;t the
&#8220;teacher&#8221; or &#8220;Bible expert.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br></span><h3><strong style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Group Discussion </strong></h3>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Each small group study is a
little bit different, but most of them contain instructions, questions and
challenges for your group. Each study will help to facilitate your group
meeting to a large extent, but it makes no promise that it will carry your
group. It will be up to you to encourage open discussion and discern when it&#8217;s
time to keep going, and when it&#8217;s time to move on. You are in charge of leading
your group.</span>&#160;



<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br><br><span class="first">What If?</span></span><span class="first"> <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br></span><h3><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>What if someone consistently
breaks the ground rules of the group?</strong></span></h3>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Your
first step should be to talk one-on-one with the person away from the rest of
the group. Remind them of the ground rules and how they can help you keep the
group a positive experience for everyone. Focus your discussion on the &#8220;event&#8221;
that happened.</span>

<br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">If that
doesn&#8217;t work, sit down with the person and someone else from the group. If no
meaningful changes occur after taking these steps, it would be appropriate to
ask the person to step out of the group. This plan follows the guidance given
in the Bible in Matthew 18:15-17. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br></span><h3>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">What if there&#8217;s conflict within
the group? What if a discussion turns into an argument?</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</h3>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Move the
furniture up against the walls, clearing a large space in the center of your
living room. Let the opposing parties fight it out, and whoever is left
standing gets to be right. (Kidding.)</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Seriously,
there&#8217;s a healthy principle that says, &#8220;What happens in the group needs to be
resolved in the group.&#8221; As Host, your role is to remind everyone that the group
needs to be a place that allows healthy disagreement, but not at the expense of
respect for one another. This is a great opportunity to look at what the Bible
has to say about disagreements. Have the group turn in their Bibles to
Ephesians 4:15 to read about &#8220;speaking the truth in love,&#8221; and to Ephesians
4:32 to read about &#8220;forgiving each other.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br></span><h3>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">What if someone consistently
dominates the conversation and there isn&#8217;t room for others to talk?</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</h3>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">In a
loving but firm manner, tell the person to &#8220;please shut your pie hole.&#8221;
(Kidding again.)</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Consider
following up with them outside the group to ask them to be intentional about
holding back so the less-vocal members can take participate more easily. If it
happens again, step in diplomatically and say something like, &#8220;Dave, we&#8217;ve
heard from you on this, but I&#8217;d like to hear from others in the group who
haven&#8217;t had a chance to share&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><h3>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">What if someone in the group
experiences a crisis?</span><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</h3>


<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">This is
what community is about. It&#8217;s not all fun and cheese-based dips. It&#8217;s being
there for someone when they&#8217;re hurting. Your first step is to see if there&#8217;s a
way that the group as a whole can be of help. For instance, if the person is in
the hospital, you could call the other members to see if they can visit on
different days, or split up help in a way that one person is not responsible
for everything. </span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<br><br><h3>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">What if I&#8217;m a parent or there are
parents in my group? </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>
</h3>



<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Your
small group experience will include serious discussion, prayer and some
surprises. It will almost certainly be boring for young kids. Parents are
encouraged to investigate babysitting options (some groups have even shared a
group sitter). Every situation is different, so talk it over in your group and
decide what&#8217;s best for everyone.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">&#160;</span>

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"></span></strong><span class="first">Next Steps</span><br><br><h3><strong style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">To Meet or Not to Meet <br></strong></h3>
<strong style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">If you formed your group
specifically for one study, you might discover that some people in your group
would like to continue meeting. Great! This is just one way that small groups
are born. But it&#8217;s entirely possible that not everyone wants to continue
meeting. That&#8217;s OK, too. Either way, be prepared to discuss this at your last
meeting. Encourage the group that if some want to start a small group, that&#8217;s
wonderful, but no one is under any pressure to do so. </span>
