<p class="noPspace"><a class="sectionHeader" title="studies" href="/my/connect/SmallGroups/resources/Studies.htm">Small Group Studies </a></p>
<p class="noPspace">These studies focus on a particular topic or a book of the Bible for 4-6 weeks. Each includes Bible readings and discussion questions for each week, and some studies include homework or individual reflection in addition to the small group time.</p>

<p class="noPspace">These are some tools and tips that will help you along the way.</p>

<p class="noPspace"><a class="sectionHeader" title="Past Journeys" href="/my/Connect/SmallGroups/Resources/TheJourney/PastJourneys.htm">Past Journeys</a></p>
<p class="noPspace">Journeys come around about every year, and it&#8217;s pretty much the biggest thing Crossroads does with the entire community. It&#8217;s when we (and other churches in Cincinnati and beyond) stop just about everything else we&#8217;re doing to focus on one topic for six weeks. With everyone working through the same topic on the weekends, on their own and in small groups, we deepen our community and our experience of God. If you missed (or want to revisit) what our community has studied in recent years, that could be a great opportunity for your small group.</p>

<h3><a class="sectionHeader" title="additional resources" href="/content/small-groups/smallgroupadditionalresources.htm">Additional Resources</a></h3>
<p class="noPspace">Not sure what to do with your group? We have plenty of <a title="Small Group Resources" href="/content/small-groups/smallgroupadditionalresources.htm">free studies</a> for you to download, but if you&#8217;ve been through  them all, or can&#8217;t find one that&#8217;s right for your group, try one of  these recommended resources.</p>
