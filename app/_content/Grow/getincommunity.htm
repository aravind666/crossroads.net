<p class="header noPspace">Get in Community</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">We&#8217;re not made to do life alone.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">The weekend service can be an inspiring and challenging experience, but it can&#8217;t fulfill the need we have for community. We need others around us to be fully known, celebrated and challenged toward living like Jesus.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&#160;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Because we want to grow in relationship with God and in friendship with one another by really "doing life together," we help create different environments for building community and developing close relationships, support and accountability:</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Small groups are just that&#8212;gatherings of six, ten or so&#8212;for getting comfortable, investing in one another, changing. Some small groups discuss books. Some choose to study the Bible or serve together. Others desire simply to know each other better and share their lives. We provide groups with some resources, but what they do and when they meet is up to the group.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Community Groups are medium-sized learning environments&#8212;usually anywhere from a dozen to 50 people&#8212;for exploring specific topics and sharing personal growth. Community Groups meet for a specific period of time&#8212;typically a few weeks or a few months&#8212;and usually include teaching, personal stories and smaller group discussion.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace">Healing Groups are safe, non-judgmental environments for those of us who need help overcoming personal crises or addictions. These groups provide opportunities to connect with God and others facing similar challenges in an encouraging and discreet setting. Healing is possible. Don&#8217;t go through it alone.</p>
