<p class="noPspace">It&#8217;s an exciting time when kids start asking questions about baptism and who Jesus is. (<a title="baptism registration k-6" href="/uploadedfiles/kc_baptismpacket13.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> for tips on talking to your child about baptism and Jesus.) Kids begin asking questions about baptism for many reasons. Asking follow-up questions will help you determine if your child is just curious about baptism or if they have made a conscious decision to follow Jesus. If your child has decided to become a friend with Jesus forever, we would love for them to participate in a baptism celebration service.</p>

In the event we publish your story, we&#8217;ll edit out names, correct grammatical errors, etc. It&#8217;s such a great way to speak to others who may hear a prompting from God, as you have, to be baptized. Thanks for sharing your story with us.</em></p>
