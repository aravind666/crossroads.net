<p class="noPspace">What you need:</p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- A Bible (we recommend the NIV translation, but whatever you have and will read is fine; or, you can ask for a free Bible at Crossroads&rsquo; Information Center or look up any section online at </span><a style="line-height: 1.75;" title="Bible Gateway" href="http://www.biblegateway.com">www.biblegateway.com</a><span style="line-height: 1.75;">)</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- A journal for writing down your thoughts (see the Helpful Hints section below for tips on journaling)</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- A pen or pencil</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><span style="line-height: 1.75;">- About 15 minutes each day</span></p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">What you need to do:</p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">- Create space.</strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;"> Simply choose a time of day when you can really focus and engage. Make this time a priority and prepare for it. One way to prepare is to spend a couple of minutes in prayer asking God to meet you during your time.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">- Find a spot.</strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;"> Choose an intentional, physical location where you won&rsquo;t likely be distracted or interrupted.</span></p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong style="line-height: 1.75;">- Read The Daily.</strong><span style="line-height: 1.75;"> It will be in your inbox or My Crossroads homepage each morning (Monday through Friday) when you get up. When you read it is up to you.</span></p>

<p class="noPspace"><br /><strong>Prayer</strong><br />Before jumping into reading, spend a couple of minutes in prayer to ask God to meet you during your time. Prayer is simply talking to God, just as you are. You can tell Him whatever is on your mind and in your heart, no matter what. Having spoken your heart, listen for God&rsquo;s response. Quiet your mind. Be still. Then engage in the reading for the day.<br /><br />If you&rsquo;re newer to prayer, it can help to have a framework that covers the basics. One exercise that can help you get in the right posture is called the PRAY model (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span>raise, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>epent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>sk, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Y</span>ield). Simply state or write one thing for which you&rsquo;re thankful to God (Praise), sorry about or want to change in your life (Repent), seeking from God (Ask), and desiring to surrender to God (Yield).<br /><br /><strong>Journaling</strong><br />Writing out your thoughts is a key to growth. It slows you down and focuses your mind, allowing you to go deeper than simply "top of mind." Write down your thoughts in such a way that you can read them, understand them and choose to live differently or more intentionally as a result. Journaling can be a deeper, richer way to connect with God.<br /><br /><strong>Bible Reading</strong><br />The Bible is the uniquely inspired revelation of God, and should be regarded by Christ-followers as the ultimate standard of truth in all matters of faith. Reading the Bible sustains the spirit, just as food sustains the body. <br /><em>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that all God&rsquo;s people may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)</em><br /><br /><strong>Responding</strong><br />Engaging with God through using The Daily is ultimately about helping you know God more intimately, and grow spiritually as a result. The Daily can easily become a rote, routine thing you do to check a spiritual box. To keep this from happening, ask yourself what the Bible is teaching you about God or about how to live the life that he desires for you. Ask God&rsquo;s Spirit to transform your heart and your life as you develop the habit of daily connection with God.</p>
