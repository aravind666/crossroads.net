<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Over the past several years, Crossroads has been partnering with other organizations to combat sex trafficking. In India, every year, millions of men, women and children are trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs estimates that 90 percent of India&rsquo;s sex trafficking is internal. And in Mumbai, the third largest city in the world, in just one of its red light districts, there are an estimated 60,000 sex workers who get the equivalent of $1.50 for sex, $2 on a good night, and less than a dollar on a bad night.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our partners in Mumbai and Kolkata have been working relentlessly to bring justice and rescue to girls who are trapped in one of the most egregious forms of modern day slavery. From afar, we have provided financial support, prayed for rescue, sent care packages and hosted the heroes who have been working on the front lines to rescue girls from forced prostitution. In 2009 and 2010, small teams of volunteers went to Mumbai and showed love to these girls through teaching photography classes, painting murals, landscaping and clean-up projects.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Our experience serving partners in Mumbai revealed that without improving the quality and quantity of aftercare homes where survivors begin rehabilitation after rescue, hope would be an unlikely reality. Through the <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/gamechange">Game Change</a> campaign, we&rsquo;re investing in aftercare in India on a new level.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Since 2011, teams of volunteers have been going to Mumbai and Kolkata to work alongside our partners and the local Indian church; helping them develop long-term, sustainable solutions for providing housing, education, job readiness, social enterprise and community for rescued survivors of trafficking.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We&rsquo;re continuing our efforts to combat sex trafficking. The movement is growing, and you&rsquo;re invited to get involved. <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/goindia">Explore the possibility</a> of going on a GO India trip, or <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/my/serve/signUp.php?form=MumbaiInterest">sign up to receive updates</a> with our India Interest Group.</p>
