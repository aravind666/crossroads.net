<p class="header noPspace" dir="ltr">Adoptive and Foster Parent Groups</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">These are monthly gatherings for parents experiencing the joys and challenges of foster, adoptive and kinship parenting. We focus on a variety of topics including parenting, adoption &amp; foster care and personal growth. As we share stories, encouragement and practical training, our desire is that parents leave feeling more equipped and encouraged as they lead their families.<strong> Childcare is available in Kids&rsquo; Club for infants through 5th graders, with one week advance registration.</strong></p>
