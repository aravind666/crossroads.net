<p class="header noPspace" dir="ltr">All Year Journey</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Each of us is on a unique journey with God. He speaks to us differently and pursues us differently. And yet, there are many beautiful commonalities that connect us all as we travel with God.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Every year our community takes a 6-week journey- a time when we explore different topics that help us connect deeper to God&rsquo;s heart and to others. Come join this open group as we visit past journeys, one by one. (And bring friends- the more the merrier.)</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The 2014 series schedule looks like this:</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>iD: Jan 30- Mar 6</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&ldquo;You should make more.&rdquo; &ldquo;You should do more.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like your mother.&rdquo; Simple statements like these have crossed our radar and managed to become a part of our identity. But what if those statements you&rsquo;ve embraced as your identity are actually lies? Consider the decisions you make and the dreams you discard because you believe the lies. Consider the freedom to be who you were created to be. What if God loves you as he made you and you have tons to offer? That just might change things.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Reset: Mar 20- April 24</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s hit the reset button, or begin for the first time to discover our own beliefs about the most influential person in history. Let&rsquo;s unclutter our assumptions of Jesus, go deeper than pop spirituality and push through the stained-glass sound bytes. Let&rsquo;s meet&mdash;or re-meet&mdash;the God who got dirty with the world. The man people ran to, and ran from. The man who captained boats, ate meals with crooks and call girls, threw hillside parties, made kings panic. The man who brought the world an outlandish message and then said, follow me.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>A Journey Home: May 8- June 12</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">At some point in our lives, we&rsquo;ve felt like we didn&rsquo;t quite belong. So we put up a good front. And we may have gotten pretty good at it. But no matter how successful and in-control the world sees us, we can still find ourselves feeling alone or exhausted by the effort. This can change. What if it was possible to feel completely at home, no matter where you were? What if you could always feel understood, valuable, protected and loved? What if you could let down your guard, get recharged, find rest and be filled with bravery and hope? No matter where you are right now, you can. We invite you to make the journey home.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Free: June 26- July 31</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We might not be as free as we think we are. Even worse, we may have been duped into believing that a "balanced" life is the key to happiness (nope) or that a relationship with God is about layering on rules and restrictions (it&rsquo;s not). The Bible says that "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." Not fear. Not guilt. Not morality. Not even religion. Freedom.</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>Strong: Aug 14- Sept 18</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We all want to be strong&mdash;in our families, relationships, character&mdash;and unless we&rsquo;re in the process of being spiritually strengthened, we&rsquo;ll be unprepared for the hard times and unable to experience the fullest joys of what God has in store for us. And this spiritual strength comes not from our religious efforts towards God, but from the time we spend in relationship with God. Thankfully, we can look to Jesus as the best example of how to incorporate rhythms and practices that will help us encounter God and produce real strength in us.</p>
