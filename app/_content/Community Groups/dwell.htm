<p class="noPspace">A small group + individual experience&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Welcome to this small group experience called Dwell&mdash;a seven-part study about connecting more deeply with God, and making the relationship that you have with him a part of your everyday rhythm.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great way for Journey Home small groups to pick up where they left off&mdash;or for new people to jump in.</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Each week, your group will meet for approximately 1 &frac12; hours. You&rsquo;ll read some things out loud, ask questions and have good conversations. In between these group meetings, you&rsquo;ll have some individual work to do. And it&rsquo;s all tucked into&nbsp;one guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noPspace">Dwell isn&rsquo;t an all-church journey&mdash;so the weekend teaching isn&rsquo;t going to line up with it&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll provide printed guides that have both the small group and individual material combined into one. We went hybrid, folks. Guides will be available at Info Centers at all 3 sites on the weekend of Jan 26-27. Or you can download this seven-week study&nbsp;<a href="/uploadedfiles/dwell_final_lores.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
