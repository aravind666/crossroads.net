<h2>Stories of the Bible</h2>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">The bible is a beautiful narrative showing God&rsquo;s character and his heart towards us. Knowing the key stories helps us understand who He really is and how we can relate to him. This group looks at the major narrative themes of the bible in a way that makes an ancient text come to life.</p>
