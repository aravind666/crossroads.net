<p class="noPspace"><strong>How do I sign up to be a host?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">It’s easy. <a title="Sign Up to Host" href="">Click here</a>. (If you aren’t already signed in, you’ll be asked to do so, or to register.)</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="3" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What are the qualifications to be a host?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Hosting is easy and doesn’t require any special skills. You don’t need to be a counselor or a Bible scholar. All you need is a Bible (you can pick up one for free at the Info Center), some group members (we’ll help you find some), and a meeting place.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="4" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What are Home Team hosts asked to do?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Host your own weekly Home Team during the six weeks of the Strong Challenge, which runs from October 8 through November 20. Hosting requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to breathe</li>
<li>Finding a place to meet (preferably a home)</li>
<li>Having a welcoming attitude</li>
<li>Finding group members</li>
</ul>
<p class="noPspace">Also, consider attending the optional Host Training experience on either September 17 or October 9. It is not required to be a host, but it’s definitely a worthwhile experience if you can make it.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="5" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What if I want to host but don’t have a team? How will people get onto my team?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">There are several ways you can find people:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Ask your friends</strong> and people you already interact with on a regular basis to join your team. It could be your co-workers, neighbors, bartenders, hairstylists, Crossroads acquaintances or Community Group friends.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post your information</strong> on <a title="sign up to be a host" href="">StrongChallenge.com</a>. Thousands of people looking to join a group will use this website to search for a group to join. (If no one contacts you right away, don’t worry—we won’t make the Find A Small Group tool available before September 17.) When you post, be sure to specify what type of group you’re looking for (open to all, women’s only, married couples only, etc), the day and time you plan to meet and area of town. This will allow people to find a group that fits their needs, contact you as the host and then you can discuss the details and form your group with them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Attend a Connect Event</strong> on Sunday, October 9 to meet others looking to get connected (in-person) with a host. Connect Events in Mason and Oakley will take place at 7:30pm (hosts should arrive by 7pm to get ready for would-be group members arriving half an hour later). The Mason Connect Event will take place at the Mason Heights Annex, and the Oakley Connect Event will take place in the Meeting Center at Crossroads Oakley.</li>
<li>
<strong>Host an Onsite Group</strong> that will meet every Wednesday night of the Strong Challenge. We’ll need 45–50 hosts for groups of people new to our community to meet here for either men’s, women’s, couples, or open onsite groups. If this is something that interests you, <a title="Email Host" href="">please email us</a>. Check out the website for the details on Oakley and Mason Onsite Groups as they become available.</li>

<p id="6" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Why should I consider the optional Host Training?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">While the Strong Challenge is set up so that you can be successful without any training, we want to offer the added resources and additional security of training to those who desire it. We place a high value on this all-community journey, and we want to do everything we can to equip hosts to have a great experience. This training experience will give you the opportunity to get a sneak peek at the Strong Challenge content, meet other hosts and learn Home Team tips and facilitation skills. If you’ve been to a Host Training before, we suggest you still consider attending this one. This year will be a bit more advanced and provide valuable resources specific to the Strong Challenge.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="7" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>OK, what are the details on the Host Training?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Host training will be offered on two separate Saturdays, September 17th and October 8th, from 9–noon at Crossroads Oakley and on October 8th at Mason. These are identical training sessions, so only attend one date. The training will include a continental breakfast, an overview of the Strong Challenge materials, training on facilitation tips and fundamentals for leading a small group. Childcare will be provided. You can sign up for training by emailing <a href="">host@crossroads.net</a>.</p>

<p id="8" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I went to Host Training last year for Free. Do I need to go again?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">This year’s training will be different than past journeys. Not only will you get a sneak peak at this year’s materials, but we’ll have training on facilitation and teaching on how to maximize your opportunity as a “coach.”  </p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="9" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I’m already in a small group. What should I do for the Strong Challenge?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">For the Strong Challenge, we strongly encourage you to expand your group. Branch out and ask your neighbor, your child’s teacher or anyone else you feel led to invite. Consider the dynamics of your group and what you feel God is calling you to do. Given the number of people who are not in a small group currently and the need for hosts, we’d love for you to at least consider breaking up. Your group could split either temporarily or permanently for the sake of reproduction.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="10" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Do I need to sign up to be a host if I’m already leading a small group?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Yes. We need to make sure you receive the tools, information and optional training opportunities available only to hosts, and designating yourself as a host will enable us to do that. Without identifying yourself as a host, it’s likely you’ll miss out on important information, such as when and where to pick up your host materials.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="11" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>Can I host a group at Crossroads’ building in Oakley?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">We’d prefer that you experience community in a more personal setting outside of the building. Meeting in homes is often the best way to do this. Some groups take turns having meetings in each other’s homes. If that’s not an option, you might want to try a community room in a restaurant or other public place that will give you the space and privacy to discuss the content of the journey without distraction.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="12" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What if I’m going to be out of town for a week? Can I still host a group?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Sure. Just let your group know in advance when you’ll be unavailable, and make arrangements with another group member to be host in your place that week.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="13" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>How big should small groups be?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">Find a size that is comfortable for you. You plus your significant other does not equal a group. Our materials provide enough for groups of up to twelve people. Any larger than that, and meetings tend to be chaotic and the experience suffers.</p>
<p class="noPspace"><a href="">return to top</a></p>
<p id="14" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>What can I do with my kids while our group meets?</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">You might need to get creative. Some groups choose to meet after the kids have gone to bed. Others all chip in for a group babysitter. Either way, arrange things in such a way that if the kids are included in your group time, all group members are comfortable with the idea. Kid interruptions are distracting to some people and welcomed by others.</p>

<p id="15" class="noPspace"> </p>
<p class="noPspace"><strong>I need the Strong Challenge Home Team facilitation materials.</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">That’s not a question, but you can <a title="Free Square Group Materials" href="">download a PDF version of the Strong Challenge Home Team materials here</a>.</p>
