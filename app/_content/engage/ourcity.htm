<p class="header noPspace">ReachOut: Our City</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">We believe in changing our city. Join us?</p>

<p class="noPspace">God commands his followers to serve the poor and oppressed. We strive to take that command seriously, and we seek to learn from those who have less. Sometimes it&#8217;s a one-day citywide blitz, sometimes it&#8217;s investing time with the same child or prison inmate from week to week.</p>

<p class="noPspace">We believe there&#8217;s something for everyone, whether you can give one day, one week or 52. Try out some of these serving opportunities, until you find one that really fits. You might find a new talent or hobby, and you&#8217;ll certainly grow in community and impact lives. <br><br><a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/ThanksgivingFoodDrive.htm">Thanksgiving Food Drive</a>: meal collection and giveaway<br><a title="Thanksgiving with City Gospel" href="/my/serve/reachout/TGDayAtDiner.htm">Thanksgiving Day Fall Feast</a>: holiday meal serving with City Gospel Mission<a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/TheDiner.htm"><br>The Diner</a>: meal-serving at City Gospel Mission<a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/TheOutlet.htm"><br>The Outlet:</a> game days at City Gospel Mission<a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/HabitatforHumanity.htm"><br>Habitat for Humanity</a>: home building<a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/WhizKids.htm"><br>Whiz Kids</a>: tutoring and mentoring<br><a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/Wheels.htm">Wheels</a>: auto ministry <a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/StepUpPrison.htm"><br>StepUp</a>: prison mentoring<a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/TeamWorks.htm"><br>TeamWorks</a>: job mentoring <a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/CityLinkCenter.htm"><br>CityLink</a>: initiatives for the poor <a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/AngelTree.htm"><br>Angel Tree</a>: gift-giving for kids with parents in prison<br><a href="/my/Serve/Reachout/GoCincinnati.htm">GO Cincinnati</a>: citywide service project</p>
