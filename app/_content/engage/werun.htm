<h1>We Run.</h1>
<h2 class="subheading">(literally)</h2>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We run after a lot of things around here like eradicating poverty, connecting people to God&#8217;s transformational love and freeing girls from sex slavery. And to do all that, we have to be able to physically keep up. So we&#8217;re going to literally run and see what happens.&#160;1053 people joined us to train for all the different 2014 Flying Pig events and we&#8217;re ready to see what the fall brings.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr"><strong>WHY RUNNING MATTERS</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Lots of people in Cincinnati find joy in running. And since we love this city (which we really really do), we wonder what it might look like to love our health AND our city at the same time.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Whether that&#8217;s running your first 5K (which is 3.1 miles for those of us who don&#8217;t live in Europe) or attempting a Half-Marathon, we want to experience God through the pursuit of physical health and meet other great Cincinnati people.</p>

<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">We can&#8217;t do this alone and we aren&#8217;t experts. We simply need help, motivation and encouragement and that&#8217;s what we want to do. We&#8217;re ordinary people who want to take care of our bodies, run after God and do this in community. So get excited...our group is pretty sweet!</p>
