<p class="noPspace">We&#8217;re so happy you want to help out. Our music volunteers typically fall into two teams: Mainstage and Middle School. Both teams are into power ballads and sharing random internet videos, but they also have unique needs and requirements&#8212;which means two separate applications. <strong>Click on the links below to begin your application process for a specific team</strong> (feel free to apply for both).</p>
