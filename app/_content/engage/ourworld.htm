<p class="header noPspace">ReachOut: Our World</p>
<p class="subheading noPspace">Change is real, and it's now.</p>

<p class="noPspace">Whether it&#8217;s South Africa, New Orleans or India, we leave our own neighborhoods to be in others. We don&#8217;t go as fixers; we go as servant-learners. And we believe in forming lasting, reciprocal relationships with the people we serve. That&#8217;s how homes get built, victims comforted, children rescued and lives literally changed.</p>

<p class="noPspace">See where we're going next, and how we're getting ready at home. Even if you never thought of yourself as a "missionary," you might be surprised how it takes all sorts of people to change this world.<br><br><a title="GO Mamelodi" href="/gomamelodi">GO Mamelodi</a>: South Africa service trip<br><a title="SA Partnership" href="/my/Serve/Reachout/SouthAfrica.htm">South Africa Partnership</a>: building infrastructure <br><a title="Justice" href="/my/Serve/Reachout/Justice.htm">Justice</a>: fighting slavery and sexual exploitation in India and in our own city<br><a title="GO New Orleans" href="/goneworleans">GO New Orleans</a>: rebuilding homes in the Katrina-ravaged Upper Ninth Ward<br><a title="GO Mumbai" href="/mumbai">GO Mumbai</a>: fighting slavery and sexual exploitation in India<br><br></p>
