<p class="noPspace" dir="ltr">Student Ministry at Crossroads is a place for students in Middle School and High School to make friends, have fun and explore a relationship with Jesus. You don&#8217;t have to be an expert in the Bible to get involved. There are plenty of opportunities to help with high school students&#8212;whether it&#8217;s leading a small group or helping set up a connect event, we have a spot for you.</p>
