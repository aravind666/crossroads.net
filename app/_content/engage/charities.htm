<strong>Our Blue Chip Investment is Compassion International.</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Proven track record providing for kids in extreme poverty around the world through food and clean water, medical care, and educational opportunities &amp; important life skills.</li>
  <li>Our Unique Investment: We&#8217;re standing in the gap to keep kids in the program whose sponsors have either never started their commitment or stopped part way through their agreement.</li>
  <li>ROI: Children who participated in Compassion&#8217;s program stayed in school longer, were more likely to have salary or white-collar employment and were more likely to be leaders in their communities and churches than their peers who did not participate in our program.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong>Our Immediate Return investment is Cincinnati Pools.</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Our investment opens up pools all around the city on Sundays. (At least 8 pools.)</li>
  <li>We are investing in the Cincinnati Recreation Foundation.</li>
  <li>ROI: Pools provide a place to cool off, healthy activities for kids, &amp; a gathering place for families.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong>Our Venture Capital Startup investment is Preschool Promise through The Strive Partnership.</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The Strive Partnership is a nationally recognized, collective impact approach to improving achievement for every child in our region&#8217;s urban core, from cradle to career. &#160;&#160;</li>
  <li>Our Unique Investment: We are providing a lead investment in our region&#8217;s Pre-School Promise program, led by The Strive Partnership and Success By Six, to expedite the raising of additional capital and implementation of the program. &#160;</li>
  <li>The Read On! Venture Philanthropy Fund is the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region&#8217;s most ambitious attempt to change outcomes for generations.</li>
  <li>It is the nation&#8217;s first venture philanthropy fund dedicated entirely to school children who read at or above grade level &#8212; and 13 times more likely, if they live in poverty. A child&#8217;s brain grows to roughly 85 percent of its full capacity in the first five years of life. These are also the years when a child&#8217;s sense of what is possible is being formed.</li>
  <li>ROI: Successful launch and implementation of this initiative will improve school readiness and early reading success for generations, unlocking the potentially of thousands of children who might otherwise be left behind.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong>We know that investing in Early Childhood Education has great ROI.</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Universally available prekindergarten is not only the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do. Raising lifetime wages (and thereby tax revenues) and reducing the likelihood that children will drop out of school, get involved in crime, and become a burden on the justice system more than make up for the costs of early childhood education.</li>
  <li>The NPR Planet Money podcast on Oct 23, 2012 reported that for every dollar invested in Early Childhood Education, we get back 7-10% per year over life of a child, or between $30 and $300.</li>
  <li>Children who are not proficient in reading by third grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school than children who have experienced early childhood education.&#160;</li>
</ul>
