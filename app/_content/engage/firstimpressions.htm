<h1>Serve: First Impressions</h1>
<h2 class="subheading">Create loving environments that help people experience God.</h2>

<p class="noPspace">From directing cars to handing out pens and programs, the First Impression (FI) Team does it. So if you like being host&#8212;or at least can open five pounds of front door&#8212;join FI. And you don&#8217;t have to be a lifer. Try it out for a few weeks and see how it suits you. You can choose between weekday and weekend opportunities, and many of them are available at both Crossroads locations.</p>

<p class="noPspace">If you&#8217;ve made the decision to serve in First Impressions, <strong>the first step in your serving experience is to attend FI 101</strong>, where you will learn the ins and outs of First Impressions. From there, you&#8217;ll take the next step to begin serving on the team of your choosing. <em><br></em></p>
