<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr"><em style="line-height: 1;">Awaited: A Christmas Show</em><span style="line-height: 1;"> is an original, contemporary retelling of the Christmas story and it&#8217;s returning for an 8th season. The show is a Crossroads production of full-scale theatrical performances utilizing all local talent for everything from musical arrangements to dance to costume and set design.</span></p>

<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr">The performance&#160;includes a ten-piece band, adult choir, children&#8217;s choir, original dance performances and layered video projections. Audience members are immersed in the experience&#8212;from stars on the ceiling to snow falling to choir members and dancers moving throughout the auditorium. To make room for our friends, this year we&#8217;ve expanded seating capacity with 29 free, ticketed shows which will take place at Crossroads Oakley starting on December 5th.</p>

<p class="normal noPspace" dir="ltr">Each year, we try to find hidden gems in our community who have the kind of talent and experience that can enrich <em>Awaited</em>. In the past, our cast has included touring musicians, recording artists, broadway dancers and card-carrying members of SAG.&#160;</p>
