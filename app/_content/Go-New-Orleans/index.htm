<p class="noPspace"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="noPspace">In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated a community that was already struggling. Crossroads wanted to help. We started by sending $150,000 and a truckload of donated supplies to the Gulf Region. Then, we started sending people to build homes with Habitat for Humanity. In the process, we began building relationships with the people of New Orleans—including our friends at Franklin Avenue Baptist Church, Roots of Music and even a local Subway restaurant owner. Our work in New Orleans has become much more than just hurricane relief. We still help build homes, but we also work with partners to show love to kids at Vacation Bible School, provide family portraits to families that lost their pictures in the flood, help provide vision screenings and eyeglasses, and give hope to inner city kids through music and culinary arts programs. New Orleans isn’t just being rebuilt—it’s being recreated by a city full of passionate people, and we’re excited to be a part of it. So we’re going back.</p>
