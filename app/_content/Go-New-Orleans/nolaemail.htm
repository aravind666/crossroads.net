<html><body><p>Dear GO applicant,<br><br>Thank you for submitting your application to GO! We're pumped that you are willing to travel with us to GO make a difference in the world. If you paid your deposit online, it has already been received and there is nothing else you need to do. If you did not pay it online, please be sure to bring a check or money order to Crossroads no later than February 23 at 2:23pm. Your check should be made out to Crossroads and it can be dropped off at the business office (not the Info Center) during the week, or can be mailed to 3500 Madison Rd., Cincinnati, OH 45209. Either way, please make sure the name of the traveler(s) AND the trip is on the outside of the envelope and on the check.Your application is not considered complete until your deposit is received.<br><br>If we have more applicants than spots available on the trip we will hold a random lottery (this was not necessary on past trips). If you are not chosen via lottery your deposit will be refunded. All trip applicants will be notified of their trip status byÂ March 2 and the participant list will be posted on the website. Please do not contact us before then concerning your status as we will most likely not know the answer until that date.<br><br>Sit back, relax, and get ready for an incredible journey! And don't forget to encourage your friends and family to attend an Info Session.<br><br>The GO leadership team </p></body></html>
