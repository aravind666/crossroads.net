<h2>Trip Preparation</h2>
<p>Before all 300-plus of us head to New Orleans, there are a few things you need to know&#8212;what meetings to attend, what to pack, who's in your GO Group, when to show up at Crossroads for that 17-hour bus ride&#8212;and more. This page will address those things.  </p>
<p>Here you can find the documents handed out at meetings and any other docs we think are useful. As always, if you have questions, please ask your GO Group leader or <a href="" title="Email Us ">email the leadership team</a>. </p>
<p>Clicking on each link will download or open a PDF or Word document.</p>
<h3>THE IMPORTANT STUFF:</h3>
<p><a href="">Roommate Assignments </a><br>The information you've been waiting for... If you requested a roommate, you were matched with that person. If you didn't request anyone, we put you together with someone of similar age and the same sex. If you have questions or concerns about your roommate, <a href="" target="_blank">email the leadership team</a>. </p>
<p><a href="">Fundraising Status Form</a><br>Please fill this out and give it to your GO Group Leader or a member of the leadership team. We want to know how your support raising is going.  The rest of your funds are due July 8.</p>
<p><a href="">Daily Schedule</a><br>Want to know what we're doing every day we're in New Orleans? This is your hour-by-hour schedule. You probably want to bring this one with you. </p>
<p><a href="">Key Dates</a><br>Provides you with all the meeting dates and electives prior to the trip. Keep this one handy.</p>
<p><a href="">Construction 101</a> (aka The Kinds of Construction Work we Might Be Doing) <br>If you really want to know what we might be doing on the construction site, here's a brief overview. We won't know what we'll be doing until we get there, though. So be prepared for anything. Did we mention flexibility is a big part of this trip?</p>
<p><a href="">Assumption of Risk Form</a><br>You
need to sign this document and give it to one of the trip leaders
before we leave. Bringing this doc to our second mandatory meeting
would be great. In a donut-hole, it says that you understand that risks
are involved with this trip (it&#8217;s gonna be hot&#8211;did we mention that?)
and that you won&#8217;t blame Crossroads if something goes wrong.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">I Promise</a><br>This doc contains an outline of statements that explain the mindset and behavior that we all should strive for on this trip. Signing this doc is your commitment to be focused on serving others, to be servant-learners, and to be sub to the mission of GO New Orleans&#8211;not sub to the mission of satisfying our own desires. We ask that you read through this and, if you&#8217;re comfortable, sign it as a pledge to yourself and to the group. We won&#8217;t collect this one. And if you have any concerns about anything stated on this doc, please talk to us.</p>

<p><a href="" target="_blank">Sample Support Letter </a>(Word)<br>One way to write a letter asking for financial support for this trip. Modify it. Ignore it. Up to you. </p>
