<h4>What is as Prayer Partner?</h4>A prayer partner is someone that will support and encourage you through prayer, both before and during the trip. If there is anything that we've learned through the past GO&#160;New Orleans&#160;trips, it is the amazing power of prayer, so make sure to take advantage of this opportunity to have someone pray for you. Your prayer partner could be a spouse, family member or a close friend. If you do not have a prayer partner, we will help find one for you, but it is always better to have someone you know as your prayer partner. </body></html>
