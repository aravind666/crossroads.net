<br><span class="first"><br>Here are answers to some giving questions you might be asking.</span>
<br><br><strong>What happens with my money?</strong><br>Crossroads  will use all donations to fund a mission trip to New Orleans for 300 people,
where we will be building homes in one of the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. For more information on the trip, please see the trip
<a title="General GO New Orleans FAQs" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crossroads-media/media/legacy/goneworleans/FAQ.htm">FAQs</a>.
<br><br><strong>Are my donations tax-deductible?</strong>
<br>Generally. Crossroads is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and all donations that we receive are tax-deductible, whether you're donating to
your trip or someone else's. However, you should consult your tax advisor to see if you can deduct your donations. You will receive a receipt of your 
gift either by email or by postal mail.<br><br><strong>How can I give?</strong>
<br>Through this site, you can donate using American Express, Discover, MasterCard or VISA. You can also donate via checks made out to Crossroads 
with "GO New Orleans-Recipient's Name" in the memo line. Mail checks to Crossroads (Attn: GO New Orleans), 3500 Madison Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45209.
<br><br><strong>Is giving on the site safe? Is your site secure?</strong><br>Absolutely. Our site uses industry-standard SSL technology to ensure
 that the information you enter is kept secure from prying eyes. In addition, all sensitive information that we keep in our database is stored in encrypted
 form so that it is not human-readable.<br><br><strong>I'm planning on going on the trip. Can I use my own credit card?</strong>
 <br>Well, yes and no. We don't want people to go into credit card debt just so they can go on the trip. At the same time, we recognize that some 
 people will want to use their card for the sake of convenience, or for airline miles or whatever, and then pay later. Bottom line: DO NOT pop out the 
 plastic to pay for your trip because you don't have the cash.<br><br><strong>What happens if someone raises more money than they need?
 <br></strong>If someone raises funds beyond their $750, that money will stay in their account. That person will then be able to choose whether
 they&#8217;d like their excess funds to be donated towards other(s)&#8217; trip costs or to the GO New Orleans general fund&#8230;or a combination of both. 
 We won&#8217;t do these types of transfers until closer to the trip date.<br><br><strong>Do I have to give to a specific person, or can I give generally 
 to GO New Orleans?</strong><br>Either. To give to a specific person, enter the participant's name or e-mail address (on the memo line of the check if donating by check).
 To give generally to the project, check the "I'd like to give to the general GO New Orleans fund" or specify the general fund on the memo line of your check.<strong>
 <br><br>Can I get a refund if I change my mind?</strong><br>Unfortunately, no. Due to IRS guidelines, we cannot offer refunds as a nonprofit organization.
 <br><br><strong>I received a message saying that your site's certificate wasn't recognized. What should I do?</strong><br>Your computer's list of Certificate 
 Authorities isn't current. You should update your computer's operating system software to get a current list. In the meantime, it is safe to use the site. 
 The message is just a warning to make you aware of the situation.<br><strong><br>Have other questions, or need tech support?</strong> Send an email to
