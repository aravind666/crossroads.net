<span class="first">Welcome to the GO New Orleans Online Sign-Up Form.  We will be accepting applications through February 23.</span>
<br><br>Congrats on taking the first step towards an incredible experience. Please provide us with as much information as possible, 
as it will help us to better plan the trip. Also, please know that no person will be turned away from the trip based on their skills, 
spirituality or overall demeanor. We want everyone to GO if we can make it work. So don&#8217;t fret on your answers to some of the sign-up form questions. 
They are here simply so the leaders get a sense of who we are dealing with and how our team can best be a blessing to the world.
<br><br><h3>Sign-Up Process</h3>You can sign up as a(n): <ul>
<li>Individual</li>
<li>Married couple</li>
<li>Family</li>
</ul>
The person signing up will respond for his or her spouse and children.<br><br>Remember, you will need to submit a deposit for $200. 
You can make your deposit via credit or debit card on the sign-up form. Or, you can mail or drop off a check to Crossroads' business office. 
If you choose to drop off a check, the name of the traveler(s) and trip should appear on both the envelope and check.
<br><br><h3>Traveling with a group?</h3>If you would like to work, room and travel with people outside of your immediate family, 
then nominate one person in your group to identify themselves as the <strong>Group Connector</strong>. Then, everyone in your group must 
indicate this one person's name when you are prompted to do so during the application process (and make sure everyone's clear on the 
name; "Bob Smith" does not equal "Robert Smith" as far as we're concerned). This is how we'll know to treat you all as a group. 
We'll do our best to accommodate your request.<br><br><h3>Ready to get started?</h3>Grab your credit or debit card (if you want to pay your deposit online) 
and address book (for emergency contact info) and have them nearby for a few questions. Oh, and please answer everything. We know we're asking a lot, but 
the more we know upfront about the people going, the better we can plan the trip to take advantage of our group's talents and skills.<strong>
